0,ccthemovieman-1,"Best Of The 'Pirates' Trilogy, And Demo-Quality For Blu-Ray",9/10,22 November 2008,"After seeing all three of the ""Pirates Of The Caribbean"" films, I still think this second one was easily the best of the three. Most friends disagree with me on this, but.....hey, we all look at films differently.This was the best ""Pirates"" to me because it had some fascinating new characters; it did not have the sappy or annoying characters and romance of the first film; it had just the right mix of action and lulls and it had some super special-effects and humor. Much of that good stuff, unfortunately, was overdone in the third film.which also dragged on too long. This movie isn't short, but none of the action scenes go on too long and so the entire two-and-a-half hours is entertaining.Also (and this goes for all three of the movie) it looks absolutely super on Blu-Ray. It's the reason POTC is often shown in electronic stores promoting high-definition televisions because this film is about as good-looking as it gets. It's incredibly sharp.The newest main character is the multi-tentacled ""Davy Jones,"" and he's a real hoot. Who knows how many hours each day poor Bill Nighy had to sit in the makeup room before ""Davy"" was ready for action. (Actually, the same good be said for Johnny Depp's ""Capt. Jack Farrow, who wears almost has much makeup as the late Tammy Fae Bakker.) Anyway, between the battles of both land and sea, something interesting always is going on or being said in this movie, making it a fun ride all the way.",Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,383574
1,TheLittleSongbird,"Overlong, but this is a lively and hugely enjoyable sequel!",8/10,13 May 2009,"This film is a little too long, and doesn't quite have the charm of the predecessor. But it is solid entertainment, with a good plot, and consistently good acting, as well as the whole production looking stunning. Johnny Depp is as lovable as always as Jack, and Kiera Knightly is as lovely as ever. Orlando Bloom, while less charismatic than he was in the first movie, is still charming. Jonathan Pryce and Jack Davenport also delight, as does Stellan Skargaard as Bootstrap Bill. But an unrecognisable Bill Nighy almost steals the show as the rather creepy Davy Jones. The special effects and the stunts were very impressive especially with the very scary krakon, so was the outstanding music score and although the script lacks the sparkle of the predecessor, this is a resoundingly entertaining film nonetheless. Oh, and be prepared for a surprise at the end. 8/10 Bethany Cox.

2,skyblueangel-1,Viva Pirates!,8/10,10 July 2006,"Well, first of all, when I read the review for the movie in my hometown paper, I was a little scared that Pirates might be a let down. The trailer and the movie clips, it seemed, didn't really let on that there was much of a story line -- that it just kind of goes on and on and on, like the Matrix 2, with no storyline -- just fighting. Plus, most people do agree: sequels are hardly ever as good as the originals. And in this case, it's true... Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest isn't the original. But, its an awesome movie in its own right! There are a few surprises in this movie. A few characters come back from the first that you wouldn't expect to see in the second. but... um! that's all I'm saying. This movie is definitely a lot more violent and gory than the first one. Don't bring the little kids to it. But, trust me -- this is not a Matrix-type movie... There is an actual storyline. And a good one at that. Capt. Jack Sparrow is back as well as Elizabeth and Will, who are forced to find him and obtain his compass, or else they will face the gallows. Well, actually, Will has to find him. Elizabeth escapes, and yes... as you've seen in the trailers, she does dress up like a man for this movie. Making it all the more comical. (you'll see what I mean).The comedy was superb in this movie. Of course, it wasn't as good as the first, but you can't expect it to be. Yes, there were a few instances were they could've shortened the fighting scenes, but it was very well shot and scripted.I wish they would've changed a few things about the movie, but you can't have everything. And don't expect everything to be resolved at the end. No! There's a cliff-hanger ending that leaves you wanting the watch the next one the moment the credits start rolling.If you like the first movie, you'll like the second... And that's all I'm saying.Jack Sparrow: ""Why is the rum *always* gone?"" (he stands up and staggers) ""Oh... That's why.""",Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,383574
3,samseescinema,Dead Man's Chest is great entertainment,8/10,2 July 2006,"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest reviewed by Sam Osbornrating: 3.0 out of 4More, more, more seems to be the theme running through Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest. There's more adventure, more violence, more pirates, and more myth. Not to mention that two and a half hour running length. But while Superman Returns may have dragged some in its 150 minutes, Pirates hurtles along at a pace only expected from the offspring of a Disneyland theme-ride, rarely slowing for piddling bits of nonsense like, oh say, story. Of course, story's not the point of these flicks and it surely doesn't have to be. There's entertainment enough to be had without all the other hodgepodge. And Pirates 2, for all its expansion, manages to dodge common sequelitis pitfalls. It doesn't overdose on a memorable character from the original (cough, Matrix Revolutions, cough) or over-broaden it's scope (cough, Matrix Reloaded,cough). Dead Man's Chest is a continuation of the original Pirates adventure, just with a couple extra unmarked sails tacked onto its deck. The plot has something to do with ole' Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp, of course) and his debt to Davy Jones (Bill Nighy). Debts, as we've all learned by now, are not things Mr. Sparrow is most proficient at repaying. The Dead Man's Chest factors in as it holds Mr. Jones' beating heart, which was ravaged by the likes of a lady whom he loved in the past. The English Navy blowhards also seem to be after the chest, and blackmail William Turner (Orlando Bloom) to seek out Capt. Jack's magic compass, which supposedly points toward the treasure. Held in a cell is Will's fiancé, Elizabeth Swan (Kiera Knightley), under charges of assisting Capt. Jack in the franchise's last swashbuckler. What it boils down to is a mottled mess of a chase to find the key to Davey Jones' chest, and avoiding his gargantuan beast, the Kraken. The myth itself wrings deeper than the original's, with Davey Jones and his seafood cohorts rendered with an unholy amount of CGI goodness to make them squirm convincingly in all their scaly, slippery evil. But the plot doesn't hold much water, same as the first, though plot was never the point. As long as it paints a tastily mythological backdrop for our pirates to plunder, we're kept smiling. And even though the picture has all the weight of a paperclip, the franchise has at least matured since it's last time around. The mood has thickened and no longer can we tell that the film is a shameless translation of its Disneyland ride. Writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio take efforts to develop each of our three heroes separately, using individual sub-plots to fill in the otherwise empty molds left dry from the original. Will Turner has a family reunion with his father (Stellan Skarsgard), enslaved by Davy Jones and appearing as though he's slowly evolving into a starfish. Will's fiancé, Ms. Swan, escapes from her cell and hides as a stowaway on a trade vessel. And Jack, of course still functioning as the star of the show, develops his slimier persona with delectable cowardice and deception. Ironic that the teenagers of America have chosen Mr. Sparrow as their most prized character in film. Oh, wait, that honor instead belongs to Napoleon Dynamite. Perhaps we should be nervous about our country's future? Anyway, along with the characters the adventure is also thickened heartily; though probably not by consequence of the writing, but instead because of the greatly inflated budget. Our friends are volleyed about the seas, facing the enormous sea monster, the Kraken, whose plunger-like tentacles crumple vessels like copy-paper. Swordplay is more indulgent too, with Verbinksi going so far as to mount a chivalric swordfight inside a huge, rolling waterwheel as it bounces along the island's foliage. Verbinski juggles these stunts with ease, proving once again his film-making versatility. If you'll remember all the way back to last October (I know, in Hollywood-time nine months is an epoch) Verbinski made a quiet, gloomy little character study called The Weather Man. And before that, Verbinski also directed The Ring and Captain Jack's first adventure in 2003. Yup, this guy's the real deal. In the waterwheel sequence, Verbinski chooses not to succumb to any mere CGI trickery, and mounts a camera on the wheel's axis to show that at one point he forced Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom to swordfight on a giant spinning wooden wheel. And he's more artistic than your typical Brett Ratner-esquire director, finding a visual aesthetic perfect for a pirate's tale. But art and pretentious critic fodder aside, Dead Man's Chest is great entertainment. It's rich and exciting and chock-full of Captain Jack-isms for high schoolers to repeat over and again. And the life of pirates is still a chunk of history that Hollywood has been unwilling to bite into for a while. Pirates of the Caribbean, for all its feathery, lightweight fun, gorges on this chunk and keeps us hooked on the adventure, waiting along with all the local eighth and ninth graders next year for the midnight showing of Captain Jack's trilogy capper.",Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,383574
4,wliia,The Best Movie of the Summer (even though it was winter in Australia),10/10,1 August 2006,"I only have one thing to say about this film... BRILLIANT (with a capital B)! Although there were some brilliant moments in the film, it was Johnny Depp who was a standout for me. His witty moments (especially when he says 'Oh, bugger' when confronted by the tribe) were wonderful. There are some moments here that were nasty (not gross/gory nasty), so the little kiddies may want to avoid this one. (It is rated M in Australia, PG-13 for America) But, it was a brilliant film. If you don't get to see it on the big screen, get the DVD when it comes out. You will not be disappointed! P.S. Did anyone love the new Walt Disney Pictures logo at the beginning? I did. I can't wait to see it again on DVD!",Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,383574
5,musica1,Great summer fun! Everything I hoped for!,10/10,8 July 2006,"I will make my comments without spoilers so that people who haven't yet seen the movie can read it.One of the worst things that can happen in a sequel to a successful movie is that audiences will feel like they're seeing the same movie again with slight variations on the theme. Dead Man's Chest gives us all the characters we loved in the first movie, but puts them in a refreshingly original movie. The action sequences will keep you on the edge of your seat. And there are more laugh-out-loud moments in this movie than in most comedies. I felt entertained from the beginning right through to the special scene after the closing credits. In fact, I enjoyed it so much that I and my entire family will be going to see it again today.For parents with young children: This movie is more violent than the first movie. There is a lot of killing, though none of it is shown close up or in a grisly manner. Davey Jones and his gang are very gross. In the screening I attended, there were a lot of ""Ewwww!""s from the audience. If you have sensitive young ones, you should probably leave them at home.",Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,383574
6,Jozxyqk,"Better than the first, and that's saying something",9/10,6 July 2006,"I will firstly say that after seeing the trailer and previews for this film I had serious doubts. I was afraid that the producers would just try to cash in on the original's success, and forget about any content.I was pleasantly proved wrong.This is the most fun I've had in the cinema in the longest time. I can't remember the last time I was so entertained.Although it is a bit slow at times, and a bit predictable (although fun in it's predictability), it hardly lets up and continuously entertains.If you loved the original, you will DEFINITELY love this film. The ending not only makes you laugh, it makes you think ""What the hell?"" and will make you eagerly anticipate (major understatement) the third installment.There are some great lines, the same fun characters, an inventive and fun story, and some brilliantly staged action sequences.In summation: SEE IT! See it on the big screen. If you miss it, you will surely regret it.",Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,383574
7,editor-299,"'Pirates' is visually stunning, but drifts due to convoluted plot",6/10,29 June 2006,"Based on the massive popularity of the first installment, ""Piates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl,"" in 2003, it was only natural for a sequel to this Disney swashbuckler to make its way to theatres.After an adequate amount of time, ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,"" starring most of the last movie's original cast, Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightly, Jonathan Pryce, etc. has hit the big screen.And while the visuals, special effects and sets are extraordinary, the film seems to drag on searching for coherence in a meandering plot line which drifts all over the South Seas. It's not that I did not like this picture, or enjoy certain parts immensely, it's simply another case of the first one being better, as well as easier to understand.""Dead Man's Chest"" picks up basically where the first left off, but Will Turner (Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Knightly) are arrested on Port Royale by Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander, ""Pride & Prejudice,"" ""The Libertine""). The charge: Conspiring to aid in the escape of noted pirate, Capt. Jack Sparrow (Depp). The possible penalty: Death by hanging (the British answer to everything).Cutler gives Turner an option, however. Find Sparrow and retrieve a certain key to a certain treasure chest, and all will be forgiven. Meanwhile, Sparrow and his motley crew have beached on a remote South Pacific island (thanks to Jack's non-functioning compass) inhabited by cannibals. While the crew is imprisoned in huge, round, wooden cages suspended from high cliffs, Sparrow is treated like a demigod.After a series of goofy, but funny chases, the fun cannot last here, though, and with Turner's help, most of the men (and Jack) beat a hasty retreat from the venue. A side trip to visit what seems like a voodoo conjurer, Tia Dalma (Naomie Harris, ""A Cock & Bull Story""), sheds a little more light on things. A key such as Beckett described to Turner does indeed exist; and it opens the chest which contains the still-living heart of Davy Jones, the mythical sailor punished for all eternity for falling in love with a woman (or something to that effect).Shortly thereafter, the Black Pearl is overtaken by the ghostly Flying Dutchman, captained by none other than the squid-like Davy Jones (Bill Nighy, ""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,"" ""The Constant Gardner""), and manned by a doomed crew now more fish and barnacle than man. Turner is kept on board while Jack, to pay off some debt to Jones, is sent to bring 100 souls to Jones as a ransom. On this ship, Turner also meets his doomed father, ""Bootstrap"" Bill Turner (Stellan Skarsgard, ""King Arthur,"" ""Exocist: The Beginning"").Jones, who keeps the key on his slimy person, also has sway over a huge sea monster, the Kraken, which can destroy a vessel and its crew in a matter of moments. The special effects in these sequences are terrific.Meanwhile, Swann has stowed away aboard another ship, and convinces the captain to put in at the pirate port of Tortuga, where Sparrow is recruiting another crew, including the disgraced former Commodore James Norrington.When she meets Jack, some sparks fly, but it's in her hands that the compass finally begins to lead the way to the ""dead man's chest."" It seems that each of the protagonists - Sparrow, Turner and Norrington - want Davy Jones' heart for themselves, and this sets off a hilarious three-way battle for the organ.As expected, Depp is great in this role (although he seems a bit more spaced-out, or intoxicated most of the time), and there are some pretty good moments here (such as the triple sword-fight on a huge rolling water mill), if one can sit through the plot complications long enough to figure out what's going on. The conclusion paves the way an obvious sequel (due for release in 2007), so that last picture may clear up some of the confusion from this one.",Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,383574
8,connmoore,NOT even close to a complete movie,5/10,9 July 2006,"It is usually a bad sign if a popcorn movie like this clocks in at well over two hours. the amazing thing about that running time is, that not a single plot point is resolved in this film. Everything that is brought into the movie as being there for our hero's to overcome, is still there when the credits roll those ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MINUTES finally end. Two and a half hours, just to set up a third movie? I'm sorry, but that has to be the biggest rip off since Manhatten and those beads and trinkets used to buy it.To be sure the cast is still beautiful, (At least the leads are) and the action comes fast and furious, but it leads absolutely nowhere. The first movie was a complete film. There was a resolution at the end, and if there never had been a sequel made, it would not have affected what people thought of that movie one bit. This film requires you to see the unreleased (and let me add, not due to be released for almost another year.) Watching Johnny Depp act in these films is worth the price of admission, and its not a bad movie, just a pointless one. Personally I now know I could have saved my time and money, waited till next summer, and gone to the ACTUAL sequel, not this clumsy attempt to pad this into a five hour epic. Sheesh they were able to tell Gone With the Wind, Ben Hur, or Lawrence of Arabia in far less time then the five hours that these two movies will eventually need to resolve issues that everyone in the audience already knows the ending to.",Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,383574
9,I_Like_Turtle_s,More than equals its predecessor.,9/10,6 July 2006,"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest does the right thing as a sequel: It maintains the same carefree spirit of the original and creates an even more fitting story to the whole Pirates lore. After narrowly escaping the gallows--with the help of his friends Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley)--and reclaiming his cursed Black Pearl, it still seems Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) has a few more fish to fry. More specifically the barnacle-encrusted undead on board the ghostly Flying Dutchman, lead by Mr. Octopus Face himself, Davy Jones (Bill Nighy). Jack apparently owes a blood debt to the inky captain and if he can't find a way out of it--namely locating the secret contents of Jones' famed locker--Sparrow will be doomed to eternal damnation and servitude in the afterlife (insert Jack Sparrow's face of disgust here). Making matters worse, Sparrow's problems manage to interfere with the wedding plans of Will and Elizabeth, who are forced to join Jack on yet another one of his misadventures.Depp's Oscar-nominated performance as Captain Jack is still a marvel in slovenly pirate behavior, with his slurred speech, swaying swagger and slack, waving arms. But whether channeling famed Rolling Stones' guitarist Keith Richards or not, it's the duality of the character that continues to intrigue us. He is a lusty, fearless man with a deeply defiant and somewhat sneaky streak but whose delicate features, long, dread locked hair, Kohl-rimmed eyes and almost girly mannerisms give him a subtly effeminate air that belies his macho antics. This time around, young Brits Knightley and Bloom have a little more to do, with Elizabeth's growing attraction to Jack and Will's reunion with his father, Bill ""Bootstrap"" Turner (Stellan Skarsgård), who's soul is stuck on the Flying Dutchman. And Nighy (Love Actually) once again makes his mark as an effective villain, infusing his rather quirky acting ticks--the laconic delivery, the laid-back attitude--which shines through all the special effects make-up. Let's just say, Nighy certainly rivals Depp in the arrogant rock star stance, even if he has tentacles for a face.The other thing Dead Man's Chest does right is make things bigger and better. From a hair-raising sword fight on top of a spinning water wheel to the way Davy Jones and his crew look--all water logged and crustacean-like--the film's production value is simply amazing. Returning producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Gore Verbinski make sure the action sequences, the sets, the costumes, the make-up and the special effects give the audience a familiarity to the original while also taking them on a whole new adventure. And if you are a fan of the Disney park attraction (the one at Disneyland, not Disney World), the elements that got missed in the first one--the creepy bayou, the beating heart in the treasure chest--are in this sequel. Dead Man's Chest does lag a bit from time to time, especially in heating up the Jack, Elizabeth and Will love triangle. But that's OK. We enjoy watching their banter, as much as we do the rest of it. And for those who'll want more adventure after the movie ends, Dead Man's Chest gives us a promise the third installment will be just as much pirate fun.9/10",Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,383574
10,WithoutWings,Captivating,10/10,6 July 2006,"As a sequel, it had much to live up to the glory of the first film, and personally, I thought it had done rather well. The special effects on Bill Nighy (Davey Jones) and his pirate crew was perhaps the best; it was very realistic. The movie had a bit of a slow start, but overall was a wonderful film. Johnny Depp did well in his portrayal of Captain Jack Sparrow, as previously in the first film. Keira Knightley and Bill Nighy were also of mentionable performances. I thought Orlando Bloom was a little wooden, as I thought of his performance in the first film, but still believable and he managed to pull it off. The ending which was rather interesting, served its purpose in suspense. It left the audience hanging, and it also left me hanging in a buzz of questions. I'm extremely eager to see the next Pirates of Caribbean film. However, the film did contain quite a number of references to the first film, The Curse of the Black Pearl, and I advise you to recap your knowledge of the first film and re-watch it to get the gist. Overall, I believed the second Pirates of Carribbean was a rather good film, and very successful in standards of sequels. I can't wait for the third.",Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,383574
11,baelara,"Great fun, perfect visuals",8/10,8 August 2006,"This movie has everything a good blockbuster should have: star cast, special effects, a healthy dose of drama, romance, a villain (so to say), sadly also a rather weak story, with an ending just calling for ""part three"" (just like the last second in the Matrix trilogy) I didn't get that feeling, that the adventure is finished somehow, more like a soap opera ending. On the other hand some dialogs are really funny, and the whole movie is more like a parody on pirates. All and all: go and see this, sit down in that cinema and have a good time with friends, but if you are more into ""heavy for the mind"" stuff, this is not a must-see for you.

12,ExplorerDS6789,Arrgh! We Be Back for More!,9/10,29 July 2006,"Today was to be the wedding day of Elizabeth Swann and Will Turner. But before the ceremony, the bride and groom are both arrested, by order of Lord Cutler Beckett. Elizabeth was clapped into jail, while Will was brought before Beckett. It seems they were incarcerated for aiding and abetting known pirate, Captain Jack Sparrow. And since Will and Jack were so close, Beckett decided to strike a deal. He tells Will to seek out Jack Sparrow and acquire his compass, in exchange for freedom. Meanwhile, Captain Sparrow is reunited with Joshamee Gibbs and the rest of his crew aboard the Black Pearl. They were now in search of the greatest treasure in the history of the sea: a chest belonging to Davy Jones himself. But first, they must find one very crucial instrument to aide them in their quest: the key to unlock the chest. Later that night, Jack meets a suspicious stowaway. It was none other than the mutated form of ""Bootstrap"" Bill Turner, Will's lost father. Bill warns Jack of Davy Jones, as well as something far more deadly and dangerous...the biggest, nastiest, monster in the ocean: the Cracken.After a long search, Will spies the Black Pearl aground on a tropical island. He goes ashore to investigate and finds Jack Sparrow had been taken in by a tribe of primitive warriors, who claim Jack is their god. Playing along, Jack has his men incarcerate Will into a hanging cage with the rest of his crew. It would appear Jack had it made, although he was unaware of the fate which was in store for him: the tribe was to release the god within by destroying his mortal exterior...Jack realized this by the time they tied him to a spit above what would soon be a roaring bonfire; Will, Gibbs and the rest of the men pool together to save themselves. It was a gracious effort, and a few men lost their lives, but finally they are free, and Jack also manages to free himself of his own dilemma, and after they reunite, climb aboard the Black Pearl and set sail, leaving behind a very angry and cheated tribe; Captain Jack wanted to continue his search for the key to Davy Jones' chest, so he seeks out his old, so-called friend: Tia Dalma. They find her in a secluded swamp. She tells them where to find the key: aboard Davy Jones' ship, The Flying Dutchman. So, they set out to find the Flying Dutchman, sticking to secluded waters, so as to avoid...The Cracken.When they finally discover the Flying Dutchman, Will goes aboard alone to check it out first, when suddenly he's kidnapped by a motley crew of half-man, half-sea creatures, including ol' squid-head himself, Captain Davy Jones! It also seems Jack Sparrow has a debt with Jones that is yet to be settled: he owes him his soul. Jones tells Jack to bring him 99 additional souls so, while Will remains captive on the Dutchman, Jack, Gibbs and the Pearl crew venture to Tortuga, a seedy pirate hang out, to do some soul searching. Back on the Dutchman, Will is reunited with his father and, learns the secret of Davy Jones' chest: after a heart breaking relationship, Jones had actually cut out his heart and locked it into a chest. He who posses his heart can either kill Jones or control him. Will wanted to kill him, but Jack wanted the heart to control him; unbeknownst to the gang, Elizabeth had escaped from jail and had been following them the whole time; reunited, Will and Jack go after Davy Jones' chest. Unfortunately an old adversary of Jack's, Lord Norrington, was also after the chest, and so begins a three-way sword fight. Worse yet, Davy Jones and his gang of scurvy sea-dogs arrive too. Jack takes the key from Will, opens the chest and removes the heart. Norrington continues to battle Will and Jack and secretly swipes the heart, escapes Davy Jones and his crew, and delivers the heart to Lord Beckett! As for Davy Jones, he and his crew set sail aboard the Flying Dutchman with an empty chest; Jack, Will, Elizabeth and the Black Pearl crew set sail and soon find themselves wrapped in the tentacles of the hungry Cracken. They attempt to fight off the monster, but attempts proved futile. Elizabeth learned the monster was really after Jack, so she cuffs him to the mast and escapes with Will and the crew. As for Captain Jack Sparrow, he had put up a good fight, but in true hero fashion, he allowed himself, and the Pearl, to be taken... Will, Elizabeth, Gibbs and the crew lament over the loss of Jack and realize he was a decent man after all. They visit Tia Dalma again, who tells of a possible way to bring Jack back, but it would require sailing to the world's end. They were willing, so Dalma assigned a familiar captain to guide them. They couldn't believe who it was! To be continued...Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest. I think it was better than the first movie. It was funny and action-packed! Johnny Depp was fantastic as everybody's favorite fearless, poignant and naive pirate, Captain Jack Sparrow. Orlando Bloom, great as Will. The incredibly sexy Keira Knightley shines as Elizabeth. We've also got Bill Nighy as Davy Jones, Jack Davenport as Norrington, and Stellan Skarsgard as Bootstrap Bill; Entertaining, funny, thrilling, but a tad violent for a Disney movie. It will make you greatly anticipate Pirates of the Caribbean 3, due next year. Will they be able to save Jack? And what of Davy Jones? Did Bootstrap Bill survive? So anyway, if you're looking for a swashbuckling, thrill ride to see this summer, then set sail with Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest! I recommend it, mateys!",Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,383574
13,beeblebrox-2,A true cinematic mess,1/10,4 August 2006,"******* Contains Spoilers***********Truly one of the worst A movies I have ever seen. I have not walked out of a movie since ""The Owl and the Pussycat"" at a college movie night in 1977 but I did tonight. What a horrible, boring, interminably long mess! I sat there for most of the film wishing that someone would make the bad writers go away.The plot line seems to have been conceived along the lines of ""hmm, we have three villains but it doesn't seem to be working, how about if we add a few more, yeah, thats the ticket."" Then, when it appears that the large villain count isn't working, we have to throw in some cannibals and a giant squid just to make sure there is enough villainy for all the 7th graders at which this film appears to be aimed.After two hours my wife and I got up and left. We couldn't stand the boredom. It is insufferably long, bereft of a meaningful plot arc, overly violent for no apparent reason than to appease the aforementioned junior highers, and leaves the viewer with fewer brain cells than he or she walked in with.To be sure, the film is beautiful to look at, the special effects masterful, the makeup superb, but the acting is average (with Depp failing to supersede his marginal performance in the first PoftheC) and the screenplay gets a solid F. The film looks like it was produced by someone who invested a lot in action sequences and couldn't bear to cut them down despite their debilitating effect on the overall effort. Three glaring examples come to mind: some of our heros are imprisoned in a sphere made of bones and, despite the fact that the holes in the spheres were big enough for Kirstie Alley to escape through, we had to spend an insufferable amount of time watching our heros bounce down hills inside the sphere, climb up hills in the sphere, walk across fields (ala Fred Flintstone getting his car to start) in the sphere, fall down canyons in the sphere, and so on. If we hadn't seen enough of rolling set pieces with people stuck in them, later in the movie we get even more when another group of protagonists (or are they antagonists? one can never tell) rolls a giant waterwheel down hills, over fields, through jungles, across the water, etc., etc., etc. The producers want us to know that this wheel is not CG so they shoot it from every angle possible including a bunch of ridiculous tracking shots that have the camera rotating as the wheel rotates!! In another scene, the three pro/antagonists have a stupidly long and ludicrous three way sword fight while the damsel in distress tries unsuccessfully to get their attention (and while ignoring the hugely valuable treasure that is stolen out from under her nose). All this while being chased by undead fish people.It goes on and on. This is one of those films that could have been a lot of fun but wasn't quite fun enough for the test audiences so the producers decided to add more fun until finally it is so darn fun that you fall asleep in the middle from the sheer load of tortuous unending fun that washes over you.This film may have appealed to some but if you are looking for a good swashbuckler with a great villain and a tight plot line, look elsewhere, this ain't it.",Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,383574
14,bmelanie,Shamelessly entertaining,8/10,10 July 2006,"Some blockbuster movies pretend to be more than they actually are. They sometimes even try to be philosophical. 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest', thank goodness, does no such thing. From start to finish, it practically flaunts the fact that it is pure and utter entertainment, comic yet breathtaking. The slapstick comedy involving the various sequences on the cannibal island and the water mill are amusing, the scenes at sea with the Flying Dutchman and the Kraken draw gasps, and, as ever, the antics of Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow brings endless pleasure. Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Swann does her share too, but Orlando Bloom as William Turner is still somewhat...wooden, perhaps because of the insipid character that he plays. His (almost idiotic) chivalry and goodness simply does not click with the mischievous magnetism that Jack Sparrow and Elizabeth Swann delivers. He still does amuse from time to time, however. The supporting cast is truly stellar; Bill Nighy as Captain Davy Jones, Stellan Skarsgard as Bill 'Boostrap' Turner and Naomie Harris as Tia Dalma are simply brilliant. Bill Nighy delivers his lines with aplomb, smacking his lips as if he relishes each syllable. Stellan Skarsgard is completely believable as the wretched Bootstrap Bill, a man who has fallen to the depths as far as he can go, and yet can still find the strength to endure it all in the love he has for his son, William. Naomie Harris is just as charismatic as the former two, but her charisma is not menacing or stoic but mysterious and even alluring. When she grins her black-toothed grin, one cannot help but grin along with her. In the end, 'Dead Man's Chest' is a roller-coaster-ride of a movie that thoroughly exploits every minute of its two-and-a-half-hour running time, ending with a final cliffhanger that leaves people feeling excited yet frustrated. (Remember when you watched 'Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring' and realized that you would have to wait another year for 'The Two Towers'? Like that.) NB. If you have the patience, stay till the end of credits. It's mildly amusing.",Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,383574
15,billiejoefreak,Does not ruin the first one!,10/10,8 July 2006,"This had to be absolutely wonderful. Usually a lot of movies that have a second or a third tend to ruin the first one, and this one certainly does not. It was one hundred percent better than the first one, actually. It was still action packed, funny, and it features people you would not expect, I was even dropping my jaw the whole time! If you liked Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl, you're going to have to love this one too. Of course, Johnny Depp's acting is still wonderful as the last one, as well as Orlando Bloom's and Keira Knightley's. The effects are absolutely stunning and keeps you on the edge of your seat. I do suggest though, if you have not seen the first one, you need to see that before going to see this one..otherwise, you're going to be a ""tad"" clueless on some parts. The movie does total justice and I would see it again and again!",Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,383574
16,alexosborne80,I Would've waited for the DVD.,1/10,10 July 2006,"AHOY SPOILERS......Well i was a big fan of the original film and saw it multiple times in the cinema. The trailers for the new film were a little disappointing so helped not get my expectations too high but i still went to see dead mans chest with a fairly positive mind.OH DEAR...... Now lets start what was good about the film as it is a much shorter list....well the GGI was really good. Davy Jones looked awesome and his henchmen also looked great. The escape from the Tribe was also quite funny.Now onto the bad, well for starters the film didn't have the fun swash buckling feel too it, they went allot darker and for me this didn't work. In the first film the back stabbing had a humorous element to it, in this it felt cold and wrong. Also the humour was just repeat jokes from the first film. There were like 5 rum jokes in the film and only 2 of them were funny. There was hardly any original material, that made you laugh like the first film.The film also feels like the first part of a longer film, which of course it is but it does not stand alone by itself as a good film. They cram so much story and plot into and none of it is paid off in this film. The cliff hanger at the end does not feel like a cliff hanger the film just stopped and even the ending was contrived. They should have done an Indiana Jones and done two separate films with two separate plots with the same cast.Also the film felt very forced. Why 2 years after POTC would the Indian trading company only just decide to arrest will turner?? Why would they also want to arrest Commander Norrington for letting Jack go when Norrington apparently chased Jack Sparrow till he lost his crew?? Why the hell were the two pirates from the first film rowing a boat in the middle of the sea?? Why after escaping does Elizabeth go and see the Lord?? Why when her and will are reunited do they care about getting a pardon, they are both free why not go and live in china?? How the hell do they go and see the witch at the end without a boat?? why see the witch at the end at all?? EVen the set up for the next film was forced.To me it feels like they had a whole load of sequences and gags planned and then they wrote a script around it. The editing was also really bad, one minute Jack is running away on the Black Pearl the next he is a Tribe leader and what the hell was will trying to do at the end with all of the dynamite and rum, yeah the plan worked but it should not have done.If Pirates 3, is the best film ever then this film could be redeemed. As it stands at the moment it sucks big time and is pure filler. If you are a fan of the first film see this at your own risk.",Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,383574
17,boblipton,Topnotch Action Comedy Sequel,8/10,30 June 2006,"Gore Verbinski has had a rocky career. Some of his movies have been very funny but commercially unsuccessful, like MOUSE HUNT, and some have just been annoying, like THE Mexican. However, here, aided with a script that never takes itself seriously and topnotch actors -- Johnny Depp repeats his astonishingly engaging off-kilter performance as Jack Sparrow -- he has turned out a fine sequel to 2003's PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: THE BLACK PEARL.The special effects serve this movie well and the highlight of the film, the three-way sword duel, will keep you laughing throughout. The movie times in at two and a half hours, but you won't notice.SPOILER: The only issue that might affect your enjoyment is that there is a third movie and the last ten minutes sets you up for it. You may feel some annoyance at the lack of closure. But be patient.",Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,383574
18,palsy-1,"This movie has had its heart ripped out, much like Davy Jones",1/10,6 August 2006,"Okay, I made a previous comment praising this movie in the sense of good spirit because I liked the actors and their performances even though I horribly dread it compared to Curse of the Black Pearl. However, now that I have indulged myself in metaphorical rum, I have come to realize that I was way too forgiving of this movie. Firstly, the flaws in the content were abysmal: The plot was overloaded with action, devoid of all the quaint, understated humor of the original (ex: ""why is the rum gone?""). This movie has had its heart ripped out, much like Davy Jones. If you enjoy action heavy movies, by all means go see Dead Man's Chest. However, if you repeatedly watch Curse of the Black Pearl for nostalgia's sake and miss the subtle humor and small production feel, you will cry with agony 10 minutes into this movie. This movie takes itself way too seriously. Secondly, the only thing that redeems this movie while simultaneously condemning it is that all the glitz distracts you from the picture's lack of soul. To the special effects team, photo-real animation can be distracting when used too much! CG effects in general can be a distraction when used too much. This is a prime example of special effects gone wrong! In fact, the movie is so weighed down by its special effects that the actors don't get a chance to act (hence lack of soul). I don't blame the actors, because they did a brilliant job on The Curse of the Black Pearl so I believe they know their stuff. Thirdly, I felt the time slip through my fingers. After 2.5 hours of my life that I will never get back, I walked out of the theatre with a gigantic headache. Too many motives/ sub-plots! Arrg. Will vs his father vs Davy Jones, the Commadore vs Will, Will vs Jack, Jack vs Davy Jones vs The East India Company vs Elizabeth! What ever happened to plot line 101? The protagonist-antagonist ratio is on overload. The whole confusing mess comes to an apex when the Commadore, Jack, Will, Elizabeth, and Davy Jone's crew fight ALL at once on the island where Davy Jone's heart is buried. Not only does it give you a headache to watch, but because of all the diverging plot lines, nothing gets resolved. Annoying. I will conclude with this. I am going to see Pirates 3 because I still enjoyed Captain Jack Sparrow and his smart, witty exchanges with Ms. Elizabeth. I am determined to see what becomes of their relationship. But more importantly I hope Jerry Bruckheimer can fix what he broke... the hearts of Pirates fans everywhere. However, because the crew shot some of Pirates 3 (w/o a script) while still filming Dead Man's Chest, I think things are off to a shaky start. Jumping the gun to save money is economically savvy but not too wise with all these summer half-baked movies. First I was commandeered onto the X3 (shoot me now) band wagon, and now something worse? Still, I hold out hope. Until then I will dive into the metaphorical bottle of rum.""We're devils, we're black sheep, and really bad eggs. Drink up me hearties, yo ho!""",Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,383574
19,shanfloyd,Preserves the mood and even excels at some points.,8/10,25 July 2006,"This time I did expect a lot from a sequel and for the first time in my recent memory I am totally satisfied and adequately entertained. Come on, ""Dead Man's Chest"" starts off with the same mood and pace the first film left us with. But this film is far more complex in order to deliver something new.First of all, it is just insanely hilarious. Really I didn't expect so much bout of comedy. Yes, a few of the funny scenes are rather forced but the rest are just brilliant... and this comedy mood stayed throughout the film even when suspense and action were full on. Second, the new characters... be it the crew of Jack Sparrow or Davy Jones and his men... are extremely well-designed and well-written. For the actors, Depp's acting this time looked rather forced sometimes as he was trying hard to achieve his Oscar-nominated standard of the character. But face it, in the first film Jack was something unique, here we already know his character and his antics, manner of speech etc. So I think ultimately Depp did a nice job. Keira Knightley has got a more wide and complex role this time but she does little besides delivering her beautiful bullet-like English accent. She falters often with careful emotional sequences. Bloom also hasn't much improved from his previous portrayal of Will Turner.Bill Nighy portrays the infamous Davy Jones with much style. And the make-up and visual effects regarding him and his crew are really worth every praise. The overall special visual and sound effects are top-notch, as expected. Verbinski took special care building the sets and location, as evident by the excellent outdoor scenery and entirely believable and captivating indoor atmospheres like the bars, the dungeons and the tribal area in the river at night.The film has enough amount of action, perhaps too much at some places with the underwater monster. It ends in a rather interesting manner, making you crave for the part 3 to come out. I really enjoyed the ending and its various implications or predictions. To summarize, ""Dead Man's Chest"" is definitely one of the best summer blockbusters in a long time.",Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,383574
20,HiddenVoice,"Avast,Damn those Bloody Pirates,it's too hard to resist them Mate,they are so bloody fun!",7/10,4 July 2006,"Man,these Summer Blockbusters keep getting better and better.One after another,each better than the previous ones.I'm sorry Superman,but those bloody pirates are just so damn good that ,you've got to fall in love with them.Pirates of Caribbean is the film that shows what Summer Blockbuster is all about.They don't make movies like these you know.It was endlessly entertaining,more entertaining and fun than anything all year.Not even the Man of Steel could pull this off.With all the cast returning and more,this is a joy ride that you have to pay twice to fully experience it and feel it.I was astounded and rocked.This film was awesome.The film begins with Elizabeth Swann and Will Turner being arrested just before they were about to get married.They are accused of letting Jack Sparow escape.So in return Will must find Sparrow to help himself.While Elizabeth tries to escape, follows Will.Settling down with his ship and crew, Jack Sparrow is pretty much hidding something himself.But things of course can't be well for a damned Pirate,when a squid like pirate Davvy Jones reminds Jack that he has an old debt to pay.So,of course ,the dishonestly honest Jack must seek help from Elizabeth and Will Turner and there we go again.Another wild ride that will simply leaves you completely satisfied.One hour to this film and I found myself completely clueless.All that was taking place on screen made no sense.With all its silliness and half baked jokes really left me terribly unsatisfied and disappointed.It filled me with doubt that the rest of the film is pretty much gonna be like this.But then by the start of the second hour,the film picks up like a person can spot a pirates lie.Then it enters back to territory that made the first film so endlessly enjoyable.The smartness and clever side of the script emerged and thrills,surprises and incredible effects with huge excitement totally made me change my mind.And an ending that will leave you dying to see the third part.All that pretty much assured me that ,this sequel is exactly what I had expected.There's everything here for everyone.The thing that Superman Slightly lacked.Colorful ,fun Characters,smart dialogues,great epic-sized action.And of course,some really ,really awe-inspiring CGI effects.There are twists and surprising turns,especially towards the end ,where the fun gets even better ,scene after scene.Something great is always popping up.Though less superior than its already splendid first installment,we all loved the first one.And it concludes with a cliffhanger to leave you thirsty for the third.It's the kind of cliffhanger that Reloaded gave us,but its final installment didn't live up to expectations.But I can say this much that ,this films finale,or final installment will rock the world.The Production designs,the sets were unbelievable!They were breath taking.They were so elaborate and detailed that they meet the standards of LORD OF THE RINGS films.It gives the film an other-worldly look.As if the characters were in some kind of a fantasy world.Thank someone,that we have a versatile actor like Johnny Depp.The only actor who I would thank.Having his presence throughout the film was like having a magician constantly pulling out tricks that are all satisfying.Depp,is the first and best reason to watch this film,just like the first one.Knightley is a surprise here.The first one didn't develop her character much,but here she elevates and pushes the boundaries.She really has a lot to do here.Bloom was just like he was in the first one.But his character discovers something that will leave the audience surprised.That is his father.What a surprise it was to finally see the legendary Bootstrap Bill,and Sarsgard was perfection.And then there is the always fabulous Billy Nighy.Where the first one had Geoffrey Rush,here we have Nighy to give you a great baddie.Who never had disappointed me with his performance.So goes for the rest of the cast with a few new additions,such as Naomi Harris.Kudos,to Director Gore Verbinski,and Producer Bruckheimer and Ted Elliot& Terry Rosio for their smart,witty writing.They all give you the very definition of ""sequels better than the original"".They give you a grand spectacle.They really give you everything you deserve to get from a summer Blockbuster.It's a film that we deserve after numerous Blockbusters that didn't fully satisfied us.This film boosts a better score than the first one too.This one is purely fantasy.The Squid looking Pirates are hardly believable,I mean did they ever existed in really world?Whereas the first one had a more believable Bad Pirates.In this film,the Pirates are more Fantasy-like.And somehow detaches itself from reality.It doesn't occur to you that this might've happened.I mean Pirates that look like squids can hardly be bought.It features a lot more weird creatures,that are actually pirates and more.Giant sea monsters and creatures that are very well created with CGI.And that's one of the few big flaws this film has.It doesn't make itself realistic,nor does it take itself too seriously.When there's something dramatic and serious is suppose to happen.And yes,it's a lot more darker than the first one. Way dark.Don't bring those kids of yours,or they'll hate pirates and their misadventures.Yet,this is a splendid entertainer.It's funny,exciting,fast-paced even with 2 hours plus length.It's simply great.This film features more than you could ask for.Those 2 and a half hours in the dark will keep you thrilled throughout.This year's greatest entertainment is here and will knock you flat.I've seen many Blockbusters, from V for Vendetta,to MI3,Da Vinci to X3 to Superman returns.But none could achieve the satisfaction as this Pirates sequel did.So,it's not all that risky to trust the bloody Pirates after all.",Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,383574

The audience I saw it with barely laughed, and I felt a collective sense that they didn't want to admit how bad they had gotten burned by buying (literally) into the hype.I got in free -- and I left after an hour; it wasn't worth free. I've been to enough movies to know when one is not working -- and to ask me to sit for another hour-plus to view good special effects which only remind me how there is nothing else good on the screen, is asking too much of any moviegoer. What is amazing is, with so much money spent -- simple competent editing is amiss; the movie is not only way too long, but it also feels strangely disjointed in many scenes; basic POV shots, reaction shots, timing are not there. Like I stated, I didn't stick around to see the whole thing. It was that bad.",Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,383574

23,andrej-zupanic,A must see for all adventure freaks!!!!!!!!!!!!!,6/10,8 August 2006,"Three years after the first installment of the Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy, Jerry Bruckheimer and Gore Verbinski did it again. They have created a two and half hour long hilarious and action packed adventure that will really hold you on the edge of your seat. This film has it all, action, comedy, adventure, fantasy, big and evil monsters that look really scary and of course a great cast of actors, such as Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, Bill Nighy, Jonathan Pryce and many others.The visual effects are fantastic and almost flawless, but from time to time there are a few visible mistakes, but you can see them only, if you concentrate on that. Otherwise they are the best I have seen lately in all films with CGI effects.As for the story, it is very interesting and it is seen that the screenwriters were trying to get the best out of it, but they didn't correct all the mistakes, so the plot might be in some scenes a little less developed than in the others, but thank God that Gore and Johnny know how to make things right.Johnny Depp is again the bright light of this film. His performance is more than fantastic. I can't even find the word to describe it. Everything he does is pure magic and he really helps you to take the ride of your life throughout the whole film. This is most certainly his best performance ever, although he has created many different characters in his career, Jack Sparrow is his most complex and strangest creation.Even Gore Verbinski has developed his skills in the last ten years. From Mousehunt to this film he had many rises and falls and he learned from the mistakes he made and now he delivers us one of this year's greatest masterpieces.And Bill Highy as Davy Jones. This was most obvious a really good decision from the creators. You will most certainly remember him best from the first Underworld film, where he was playing Victor, a very strong and evil vampire. As Davy Jones he is even better. He is more evil and even more powerful and with the Kraken at his hand he really is one of the most recognizable villains in the movie history and a pretty damn good character.All in all, Dead Man's Chest is a real Blockbuster that will put you on the edge of your seat and it won't let you go till the end. But with an open ending it will really make you to see the third part. This really is a must see for all adventure freaks and is wort every single penny you pay for the ticket. One of Jerry Bruckheimer's finest films with a great entertaining value.",Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,383574
24,tabuno,Major Disappointment,5/10,22 January 2019,"9 July 2006. Long, boring, and uninteresting. This sequel tried mightedly using all the past comedic, action techniques of past movies. There was the cannibal scene from King Kong (2005), there was Romancing The Stone (1984) action-comedy, there was even the now tiring and worn out Johnny Depp replaying his comic one-liners using a weak script. There was only warmed over character development, a scattered smattering of connections. The movie by attempting to be everything ended up being too thin on most everything. The violence level was raised far beyond a family movie. The comedy was forced and lame. The only new movement was the rather new action scenes for action scene sake without really contributing to the plot. Most of this movie has been seen before in one form or another. And like Star Wars trilogy there is the romantic triangle at play here leaving for the third installment a much darker psychological conflict. Missing from this movie was the light hearted fun (that was seriously attempted) that didn't seem to balance the more darker, sinister forces at work here. Five out of Ten Stars.

25,Gubby-Allen,As bad as the first film was good.,1/10,8 July 2006,"Sums it up really. The first film was completely original & a refreshing change and while the sequel - indeed any sequel - by definition can never have that trait, they can at least retain some of the values of the first film.This was appalling drivel & I'm staggered so many have rated it as high as the first. What were you watching? Sparrow's character was one of the greatest in movie history. It was nothing here, he lacked any of the charisma or lines of the original and to paraphrase another critic here the ""seem like an honest man, tell lies, and really be honest at heart"" characterisation was flogged to death. Knightley seemed far too cocky in her role and Bloom was given a lot of screen time for a plot which never bordered on interesting. Although the latter could've been avoided had they merely removed the entire 45 minute tribesman / island scene near the beginning which served absolutely no point to the rest of the film whatsoever.Whereas in the original the plot was simple & yet brilliantly effective this was a complete mess & merely a selection of incoherent & unnecessary scenes lumped together and seemingly decided on 1) how much they cost to film & 2) how loud they were as opposed to whether they added anything to the film at all.The target audience seemed completely different to the first. The original seemed to be written towards intelligent adults but with consideration to younger viewers. I mean no offence here, but I got the feeling 90% of this was aimed at the average three year old, bar the concept of Davy Jones which would be asking a bit for a 12 or 13 year old to take on board first time. If you'd gone more than a couple of minutes without a good line or scene (which it frequently did) throw in a few ""man gets hit on head with rock"" or ""man trips over"" gags & all will be forgotten. Granted in my cinema they got a few laughs, but they sounded like children's laughs in comparison to the original.I'd accumulated about 250 questions & points I was unsure of within the first half hour and while some were answered later on (too late usually - as you'd got past caring) the key points were usually glossed over so quickly, presumably so the plot holes & plot jumps were not questioned. Much of this was brought about by too many characters in the film as a whole, particularly early on.A good sequel IMO, is one where you imagine the original had never existed and this was it instead. Regardless of whether the plot is better or worse does it still offer the originality & core values of the first film. This never came close. The plot was dull & sacrificed for noise & effects & the characters had nothing likable about them. The major ones never evolved at all, the minor ones just recycled the same gags & lines from the first film, which were great then but not again.I still await the 3rd film with anticipation. There's every chance it could be another classic like the original, especially if they take on board the faults of this one. Lets hope Pirates of the Caribbean follows in the mould of Die Hard with two classic films at ever end, with a pointless one sandwiched between them.Sorry but 1/10 - no redeeming qualities at all.",Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,383574
26,glen-88,Pirates of the Convoluted: Long friggin film,4/10,8 July 2006,"I wanted to like this movie. I really did. But by an hour and a half into the film with no real understanding of what was going on I started to doze off. When I awoke there was still another hour or so to sit through.The actors of course all did a good job. The dialogue and humor was there in the beginning though by the end it wained considerably. The real problem was the plot. This new ""curse"" that befalls Jack Sparrow gets more complex every five minutes, and nothing is really explained. Near the end the scenes usually go something like this:""Good lord man where's Davy Jone's key?"" - Jack Sparrow ""It goes to the box! But where is the box?"" - Will ""What box? I have his heart!"" - Some guy ""who are you?"" - Jack Sparrow ""I'm some guy from the first movie, and I want his heart!"" - Some guy ""Hey there's a cracken here with tentacles!"" - Will ""Now I have his heart!"" - Some other pirate guy ""What about the cracken? And the curse?"" - Will ""What curse?"" - Other pirate guy ""The curse of the box!"" - Jack ""No the curse is on the key!"" - Will ""No, whoever has the heart has the power!"" - Will's dad ""What power?"" - Keira knightley ""Dont mind that, lets fight!"" - JackOK well its not exactly like that but thats how it feels after sitting through all three mind numbing hours of the film. The big twist ending...is well, lame. They bring back someone - a certain bad guy - to help poor JS out of his jam in some thrown together lame cliff hanger.I'm not saying everything about the film is bad, but it definitely needed a rewrite before it was released. More doesn't always mean better. Aaaarggghh, what a shame.",Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,383574
27,Rocking DH,"Not perfect, but who/what is?",9/10,21 July 2006,"""Dead Man's Chest"" does not have the strong hook in the initial 10 minutes that ""Curse of the Black Pearl"" did. I wanted to see Will and Elizabeth preparing for their nuptials, the guests being seated, the musicians playing.... It just seemed like some footage was cut for running length that might have built a more emotional response to Will in irons and wet wedding music on a stand and a soaked bride with no father present. I also found the EIT company gentleman arriving in a small boat while mounted on a horse odd. Was this actually done in history? Given wave action, I should think the horse would have a hard time balancing--especially in such a small boat--and anyone sitting astride would be in risk of a dump in the drink. Incroyable! Given those reservations, DMC does provide an escape from the summer heat or the world and its current woes. It is darker and creepier, but what isn't these days? Red herrings fly in every direction, setting up the sequel. Johnny Depp has Jack running between raindrops and playing everyone off everyone else. Of course, things have to catch up with Jack. We are told what will happen at the beginning. No surprise when it does--although the manner has a twist. However, since Jack wisely palmed a piece of Aztec gold before fighting Barbossa, it is not surprising that he has managed to collect a couple items in Tia's home while there. He's ready for anything. Including the sequel.I found myself wanting to see more of Will Turner in DMC. He moves the action along, has a few tender/dramatic moments (the best being his vow to his father), and one of the funniest scenes when he tries to charge out of the mill wheel, sword in hand, and doesn't quite. Interesting that he does not press Elizabeth about what he saw as they fled the Pearl. Since he is called ""a man of destiny"" by Tia, I have a feeling that PC 3 will have more Will Turner, Jr.Elizabeth has a much larger role this go-round than Will, it seems. Her chemistry with Jack is tangible and convincing. Nicely done by Ms. Knightly and Mr. Depp. She, too, plays people off each other, using them. Pirate, indeed. But didn't she steal Will's medallion right off? Bill Nighy and/or CGI managed to make Davy Jones' octopus-type head expressive with just his eyes showing. I'm sure we will learn how Davy sustained and survived his coronary bypass in the sequel--and who the mystery woman is who drove him to be the devil of the sea. Someone with a matching music box, perhaps? Maybe another herring.I do hope the sequel will rescue Jack, the elder Mr. Turner, the Governor, and the dog, and bring back Murtog and companion. Surely the world will still be here next summer and ready for another Pirates diversion. The cast and crew and production staff must have toiled hard to produce PC 2 in various locations through one of the worst hurricane seasons we've had in recent years. Thank you for your efforts.",Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,383574
28,shaid,"Long,boring and chaotic.",1/10,22 July 2006,"*MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* *MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS * *MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*When a sequel is coming for a successful film you can be sure that on one thing. The makers of the film will do their best to milk out the success of the original. This film is no different. Producer Jerry Bruckheimer and film distributor Walt Disney, have done that to the maximum. On it's way to the financial success of this film they managed to take any freshness from the first film and left us with one boring, long and chaotic film. Everything that was working to the advantage of the 1st film has become a disadvantage of this sequel. The characters are as shallow as the sea level after the high tide(and when you see they are credits for 4 writers for characters, one can wonder what were they paid for). The jokes are not working. The action sequences are too long and make the film longer than it actually is. Its 150 minutes playing time seems like eternity. You want the film to end but had to endure more and more of this nonsense. The script is full of holes and can be summarised in one sentence(as 2 of the characters do, somewhere in the film). The script and therefore the film has no logic and serve only as a point to promote the Disney's attraction its based upon. The film doesn't even try to explain why some of the things happened it basically says: That is how it is, live with it. You want logic, look somewhere else. The open ending(and not only ending-some plot-lines remain unresolved) suggest that this film is a long exposition for the 3rd installment of this franchise(logic when you know that part 2 en 3 were filmed simultaneously).In 2 sentences: A waist of time and money. Ignore this film and you will be rewarded.",Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,383574
29,bob-1135,A big disappointment,4/10,12 August 2006,"I am beginning to believe that I am the only person who was disappointed by this sequel. The film distinctly lacks pace and often grinds to a dead stop. Scenes which should be rolling along with the velocity of a runaway train, stagger and falter like a drunk. For example the overlong scene between Jack Sparrow and the cannibals. The main characters boarded and left the Flying Dutchman so rapidly I lost track of what ship they were supposed to be on after a while.I'm afraid the film has fallen into the Star Wars trap of replacing plot with special effects.Watch the first Pirates and then this one and you will see what I mean.

This film however , is just a cash in on the interest generated from its predecessor and didn't need to be made.NOTHING happens in it.Well apart from the last 45 minutes , which is a huge advert for the third film. Plus , Knightely - did she actually have any lines in that film? Brief plot synopsis- Jack Sparrow and his mate Bloom have a sword fight on a big wheel while Knightely pouts.I will definitely not go to see the third one. Id rather pour acid down my pants.Avoid this movie unless you are completely brain dead or want to feel like you have had your wallet stolen.

31,lee_eisenberg,"Sail away, mates!",10/10,3 August 2006,"We all know that in sequels, they take everything one step further, and you'd better believe that ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"" does that! With Johnny Depp continuing his Keith Richards-style buccaneer Jack Sparrow, Orlando Bloom resurrecting Will Turner, and Keira Knightley resurrecting Elizabeth Swann, how can you go wrong (especially since this sequel is grittier than the original)? Obviously, there's plenty of swashbuckling and CGI, but it's Depp's characterizations that carry the movie. Whether it's battles with Davy Jones and his crew, or an unpleasant encounter with the Kraken, this movie has something for everyone. Really cool.Also starring Jack Davenport, Bill Nighy, Jonathan Pryce and Stellan Skarsgard. Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum!

32,robinpix,Loved the FIRST one and the SECOND is just as GREAT!,9/10,2 August 2006,"A great continuation from the first movie! You definitely need to see the first movie before this one, otherwise you'll miss some crucial elements about the various characters and plot. Don't miss the bonus scene at the end of the very long list of credits. Casting was brilliant and not a flaw anywhere. Left me excited about the third movie. Johnny Depp is fantastic! Depp deserves to be nominated for this role! The special affects and action scenes were exciting and showed tremendous thought and skill into the making of this movie. The movie was suspenseful, dark, funny and contained beautiful cinematography. The costumes and makeup were amazing.

Faced with a potential afterlife of servitude and damnation, Jack also has the upcoming wedding of Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) to consider ...What a dreadful way to spend 2 hours and 30 minutes of your life.It wasn't funny. It wasn't interesting. It didn't capture any magic of the first film and it was too damn long.While the acting and directing is good, the writing falls flat as the plot is way too confusing and it doesn't interest you enough to even try to figure it out.The only good part was the scene towards the end where they're at the island- but that isn't enough reason to see the movie.",Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,383574
34,Doddi,On the way to becoming one of the greatest trilogies!,10/10,27 July 2006,"Pirates of the Caribbean:The Curse of the Black Pearl is one of my favorite movies - it introduced me (and few other people in the world) to a certain Captain Jack Sparrow. What a beloved character he has become and Depp is perfect in this role. All is well that ends well, and movie no. 1 was a unique masterpiece.Here, however, one immediately starts to think of the original Star Wars trilogy or even Back to the Future, Matrix ... etc. Not because of any reference (although one can easily do so), but because this film is a true example of a great trilogy in the making. I am at awe, truly. Everything in this film is perfectly done, but the only negative side is that I have to wait until next summer for the final chapter to appear. If I would break it down a little, I would do it like this:Costumes: perfectly done. I haven't seen that many pirate movies but I have a feeling how a pirate should dress, and here the costumes are flawless.Music: Always an important factor for me. And I loved Badelt's score in the first one, but Zimmer takes it further and with familiar references to Badelt once in a while. Awesome!Script: Without giving to much, I think the scriptwriters have done an amazing job, I loved the dialog, I loved the scenes and interactions and I loved the ending - that's all I can say!Visual effects: Flawless, yet again. The Kraken is without a doubt one of the best cgi characters I've seen. And of course Davy Jones's face! and other sea-creatures and the cursed crew of the Flying Dutchman.Acting: Depp is hilariously great and awesome, Bloom and Knightley improve a lot, Bill Nighy is fun and of course the smaller parts are all cleverly cast and wonderfully executed.Action: One of the best I've seen! The turning-wheel sword fight (don't worry - this has been seen in trailers so I'm not giving anything away) ... pure magic and skillfully done. And other action is great!Direction: Verbinski is a master at work here, no doubt about it.With this in mind, I think it's gonna be hard to top this one. The final chapter is gonna be awesome, but until I get to see it (with the rest of the world) these two films are gonna entertain me very much.To sum it up in few words: The Greatest Entertainment you can find this year!

The movie is directed by Gore Verbinski backed by powerful music of Hans Zimmer.This movie should be remembered for powerful performance by Johnny Depp and great background music by Hans Zimmer.The movie excels in almost all the department and apart from Johnny Depp other characters are also effective. The only thing that is over to top is it's CGI. The action and violence is the backbone of the movie but twists and turns which will keep you glued.The movie sets perfect tone for it's sequel. A must watch specially for Johnny Depp fans.

36,ronney-2,Wow!,9/10,10 July 2006,"I loved the first movie, so I had to see the second one. The beginning was a bit slow, but there sure was a lot of action. The sword fighting scenes were exciting and in some cases rather funny as well. The special f/x were outstanding. All of the characters were believable, even the computerized ones. The voodoo lady was hard to understand. I caught every other words she said. I'm sure I'll get all of the humor when I buys this DVD and play her section with the CC on! I didn't quite understand the reason behind the part of the movie with the tribal people other than it gave the movie more action scenes. That whole section could be removed and the movie would still flow well. I loved Commodore Norrington in the first movie. I was disappointed with what they did to him in the second movie. I hope he returns in all his glory for the 3rd Pirates movie.I saw a few young children in the theater and was horrified to think that those young eyes saw some very scary and gruesome images. Please, don't take your children until you've seen this yourself first.The movie is a perfect cliffhanger.

37,jaarlei,A wonderful film,9/10,5 July 2006,"I just came out of the movie 30 minutes ago (as it was released a day before America over here).The movie is visually stunning - the CGI is top rate and you won't spend the whole film groaning about how fake things appear on the screen.Acting was brilliant. Johnny Depp once again proves why he's the only man alive who can play the role of Cap. Jack Sparrow. There's a great number of returning characters from the first film - including a couple I was very happy to see again.My only fault was perhaps that this film lack a certain 'heart' that the first film had, which I believe came because the first film was something very different, which of course this film couldn't contend with.That aside, you will hardly notice it.

You will be glued to the screen from beginning to end, not wanting to miss a single minute of the action. The plot is original and entertaining and really takes ""Pirates"" to the next level. Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, and Keira Knightly are brilliant once again as Jack Sparrow, Will Turner, and Elizabeth Swann. There are also several familiar faces that will entertain and surprise fans. Will Turner fans will definitely not be disappointed with ""Dead Man's Chest."" This second outing allows Will to show his magnificent and exceptional leadership abilities and once again his undaunted bravery and love for Elizabeth. The music to accompany the action is fantastic. Hans Zimmer does a magnificent job capturing the power of the movie. The soundtrack is driven and epic in nature to support the grandness of the movie. Fans of ""Pirates"" will be humming the music in their heads for days. Now that ""Dead Man's Chest"" has finally sailed into theaters -- taking the box office by storm -- the countdown is on for ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End"" (tentative title?) due out in May 2007.

39,one_letter,I loved it but this review might seem a little harsh,6/10,5 July 2006,"Well, I've seen it. I like to call myself one of POTC's biggest New Zealand fans, but I am going to be as honest as I can. So this is my first impression. In the first ten minutes my thoughts were, well, this is a bit dark and bleak. The very first opening scene shows a right royal set of teacups being drenched by rain. Very dismal and eerie. Then we get a close up on Elizabeth sitting in the rain with the most depressed look on her face, surrounding her are the ruins of the wedding. Several bleak scenes later we have been introduced to Lord Beckett and the lives of Will and Elizabeth are in shaky hands. We shift to Gibbs singing, 'fifteen men on a dead man's chest' looking out upon a rather frightening fortress. Then we are re-introduced to Jack Sparrow, who is escaping this fortress. This intro is nothing compared to Jack's original entrance in POTC1 but it still is rather amusing. There are a few sharp, graphic, jabbing images throughout this but luckily, at this point the movie seems to take a turn (thank goodness, several young children next to me looked scared to death). We learn of Beckett's task he has given Will and Will meets up with Jack and his Crew on the cannibal island. I really enjoyed this part of the movie, some of the close-up, special effect shoots were a bit cheesy but we saw Captain Jack doing what he does best, escaping.The movie progresses, I won't tell you much more but to say Davy Jones was excellent, Norrington was a surprise (I wish they had given him more screen-time), Elizabeth's little tantrum on the beach was rather funny but a little too over the top, Tia Dalma was great but I think she could have been so much more. And lastly we have the ending. It was Great. That Elizabeth Swann, my, my, my..I was actually quite surprised the writers decided to let Will witness that little...um...peck (?) at the end. I also didn't consider the fact that throughout the whole movie, when Elizabeth had Jack's compass, it didn't always point to Will and the chest?!??! That's definitely something to ponder about. The final scene is at Tia Dalma's shack were everyone is feeling numb with disbelief. Suddenly everyone is agreeing to 'sail to de end of de eart and beyond' and we meet the captain for that voyage. A man most of us never expected to see again. That final shot of Barbossa munching on his apple, grinning at everyone's shocked faces was awesome. All in all.umm..it was different, fresher, darker than the first. I also thought it was a little forced. Filming the first movie, they had no idea how much of a hit it would be. This time around they did. They had the money for all the big over the top special effects and they also, well, so it seemed, tried to make Jack Sparrow entertaining. What worked last time was the fact they wrote it with no idea how Johnny Depp would interpret it, this time they did. It just seemed like everything in the movie was the crew trying to hard. But I think I loved it none-the-less. Most of this I've written is me being picky, I think the only thing I truly disliked were some of the special effects shots, not the computer generated stuff but some of the others. Was it as good as the first movie? Yes it was, but in a different sense. They both have the same characters but they are both very different to each other. Was I disappointed when I left the cinema? After months of anticipation, was I disappointed? No, thankfully not. Expect to see me watching it again, and again over the next few weeks.",Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,383574
40,TheWillVega,Summer of '06 has turned out very good for cinephiles,9/10,20 July 2006,"I had a great time with X3, Da Vinci Code, A Scanner Darkly, and Click so far this summer but just when I thought there would be a drought in the middle of summer, along comes Pirates which makes a splash into cinemas and bring forth a tidal wave of...Okay, enough with the puns. This movie was great, plain and simple. Even better than the original, in my opinion. And I didn't even like the original that much, I just saw it for Johnny Depp and Keira Knightly (yow!). But this time, there's a lot more to see than good ol' Johnny and Keira.Yup, a lot more.First off, the story pacing is a lot slower and steady. Something I loved very much. We explore the changes in character with Elizabeth, Will, and Jack even more (with two new recruits as the comic reliefs), with bits of comedy and incredible action here and there. While I thought the Skeleton Barbossa from the original was okay, the new one (the squid-like Davy Jones) actually felt pretty intimidating and incredibly 'wow' to look at. The same goes for the rest of the crew, the makeup effects are incredibly top notch.The movie takes its time in telling the story, letting you soak into the characters and beautiful scenery. Gore and his team have a good eye, through realistic landscapes, makeup, and even with CGI (which is rare nowdays for people who heavily abuse CG).The music seems a little better too, Hans Zimmer seems to carry the soundtrack on with more of an epic beat this time (and doesn't let it drag like it did in the original). The Pirates' theme sounds a lot more ""adventerous"" this time, the new beat really helps enhance the movie even further than I could've imagined.The action was one of the things that surprised me the most. They somehow managed to top themselves every time a major action scene comes up. The over the top sword fights, the ship battles, the bar fight...every single one of them was great and better than the last.Not a whole lot more to say that's not spoilerific other than...you have to see this movie! NOW!!",Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,383574
41,Dash_Rendar,Just barely misses the mark.,8/10,19 October 2006,"The eight-star score is generous. Dead Man's Chest is definitely not a bad film, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't disappointed a little. It's always tough to create sequels to successful blockbusters and have them live up to original's name. The first ""Pirates"" film had a rare charm that most other Hollywood pictures would envy. Fantastic characters, a great story, amazing special effects, and an all-around ""fun"" feel. It's not hard to understand why it became so popular.On paper, nothing really seems wrong with Dead Man's Chest. It has the same elements that made the first film a hit. Yet at the same time, something felt missing.Two of the ""main three"" characters (Sparrow, Turner, and Swann) seemed to have experienced a personality makeover. Initially, all three characters are likable and you found yourself rooting for them through both good and bad intentions. That's not the case in DMC. Jack Sparrow and Elizabeth Swann both show their dark side and become devious, cowardly, and double-crossing individuals. Their actions are so despicable that even a movie audience will have a hard time justifying them. Will Turner, however, is still the same honorable and loyal gentleman that is the fish-out-of-water among cutthroat pirates. This leaves Turner as the only remaining likable character out of the ""main three."" On the other hand, there is one character change that I was pleasantly surprised with. Commodore Norrington. In the first film, he was a snobbish stiff that dedicated himself to capturing criminal scum and bringing them to justice (or execution). In DMC, an unfortunate twist of fate causes his character to do a 180* and become the very same scum he once fought to destroy. This spin is very amusing and one of the highlights of the film.A great amount of the storyline felt like filler, as if they were just there to set up the next action scene. This formula works for B-movies and martial arts films, but for a big budget film like DMC, it feels awkward.The humor is hit-and-miss. It's impossible not to smile Johnny Depp's performance, even at his most outrageous moments. However, it often feels that the writers tried too hard to squeeze in humor at inappropriate places just so they can meet their humor quota. This sort of bad timing is another element that sets DMC below COTBP in terms of quality.Davy Jones and ""Bootstrap"" Bill Turner are two terrific additions to the ""Pirates"" cast. They both add to a very dark atmosphere that the overall story focuses on. While the dark tone is a welcome change for the series, it also makes the story a bit depressing. You can't help but pity Bill Turner, trapped in a world that he can never escape.Though far-fetched at times, the action/sword-fight scenes are a ton of fun to watch and help make DMC an all-around solid film.The ending is not 100% satisfying, but that was done intentionally to build up anticipation for the third (and perhaps final) film. I hope that the third film improves on what I didn't like about the story and ties up all the loose ends so it can leave audiences feeling thrilled and satisfied. If they do, The Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy has the potential to be remembered as classics worthy to sit by the legendary Back to the Future and Indiana Jones series as great timeless adventures for everyone to enjoy.",Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,383574
42,sapphire_dragon-1,Captain Jack's Back What More Is There To Say?????,10/10,10 July 2006,"Absolutely brilliant. Really there is nothing else to say. It really does live up to the hype. The acting's fantastic, the dialog's fantastic,the plot's fantastic, the effects fantastic, the locations fantastic,the whole movie just fantastic. All your favorite character's are back better than ever with new ones to spice things up and stir things up including some tantalizing clues about Jack before the Black Pearl. The sequel has done the first movie proud. If there is one movie to see all year it has to be this and I cannot wait for the third even though it will be sad that it is the last one. Pirates of The Carribeans is really one of the few intelligently humorous movies out there. This is what happens when Hollywood does sarcasm right. If only there were more Captain Jacks out there.

43,ccemev-movies,OUTSTANDING! Can't wait for #3 (not much of a spoiler),10/10,10 July 2006,"Even my husband came along to a midnight showing on opening day! Great continuation of storyline, but built upon #1 as well with new characters. I loved how the original actors - even in the smaller roles - reprised their casting, which assisted in the story flow. As with #1, this movie was not totally predictable, although I expected it to be so. A bit more violence, but less viewable so that does not change my thought to take the younger ones (probably 9-10 & up). This is definitely a family movie to see together, then go home and watch #1 again. As with Back To The Future, #2 leaves the door open for #3 to follow.

44,xlivestrong32,Interesting...,1/10,7 July 2006,"(MAJOR spoilers.) Pirates of the Caribbean. Dead Man's Chest. It was full of jokes, some were good, and pirates. Which was about it. It didn't seem to have a real story developed behind it. From what I gathered, Capt Jack Sparrow owes Davey Jones a favour. After a few minutes, the infamous Sparrow finally comes! You'd think he'd be the first character introduced, but it actually started with a rainy, glum day, which looks like Elizabeth Swan and William Turner's wedding. Except it didn't really happen. Anyway, back to Sparrow. He goes down to the bottom of the ship, searching for rum, muttering, ""The rum is always gone,"" and in the corner it's...BOOTSTRAP BILL! He's covered in barnacles and gives the Black Spot whenever he touches someone. It's quite funny to watch an undead Turner covered in barnacles chatting it up with Sparrow. Maybe I have a bad sense of humour. Bootstrap boards the Flying Dutchman is some undisclosed scenes.FORWARD.William has to get the compass from Sparrow to save Elizabeth from jail. It turns out they got arrested for trying to free a pirate. So, he finds Sparrow as the newly-instated chief of a tribe that speaks a very entertaining language. He, Sparrow, has really cool makeup on that makes him look like he has eyes on his eyelids and three sets of eyes on his cheeks. Anyway, William gets caught sneaking around the island and is captured. William is trying to get Sparrow to tell the natives to free him, but Sparrow, of course, doesn't bother and actually eggs the natives on. Quite funny, William Turner being tied to a huge stalk of bamboo being roasted. But, with his pirate instincts, Sparrow tells the natives to get a bigger log for a bigger ""fi-fi! (fire)"", and while doing so, Sparrow (alone) and Turner (?) escape. But after a while and confusing scenes, Sparrow is caught escaping and his tied to wood and is put over a fire. Comically trying to blow out the fire from five feet away, the fire spreads. But he gets down. All is well for him.FORWARD.So, it turns out that William finds out his dad is alive! REUNION. There's an awkward relationship between the two, mainly due to Orlando Bloom. It's quite funny: Bootstrap's white make up, progressively during the movie, comes off from around his eyes and you can see his skin. Very distracting. So, William hops aboard the Flying Dutchman, chatting it up with his undead father. Then, William needs to get a key from Davey Jones to open a chest to destroy the heart within. Bootstrap and William play a game of dice, or something, against Davey Jones, and lose. Bootstrap ruined it. So he, William, can't destroy the heart to regain the soul of his father until he gets the key for the chest.But one night while the organ-talented Davey is snoozing by his beloved organ, William steals the key and ventures out to find the chest. Gets advice from sea-monster sidekick of Jones's in wall. BUT IT TURNS OUT...the compass of Sparrow's isn't broken!!! It really shows you what you desire most, almost like the Mirror of Erised in Harry Potter, but it's a compass. Anyway, Sparrow finds that out and tells a pirate outfit-clad Elizabeth in order to find the missing William, who is aboard the Dutchman, she must find the chest.So William escapes in order to find the chest and to get back to Elizabeth. He boards the Black Pearl. The Black Pearl, which is in Sparrow's hands, reaches the island of the chest first, then the sea-monster sidekicks on the Dutchman: Jones cannot leave the ship. When Elizabeth, William, COMMODORE NORRINGTON? and Jack Sparrow find the chest, the guys reveal their use for the chest and turn on each other, duelling with swords. Commodore and Turner get caught up 'cause they both love Elizabeth, and Sparrow gets the key for the chest. The four of them run into the vegetation of the island and find the sea-monster sidekicks fighting them. While duelling upon a rooftop, Commodore and Turner are stuck on a wheel or some sort, but huge. They fight on there for a while and on there, Sparrow gets a hold of the key and gets the beating heart of out the chest.It's Pearl against Dutchman crew fighting now. Sea-monster sidekick of Jones sees Sparrow with heart and Sparrow frantically puts it in a jar. Everyone gets out of the fight unscathed except Commodore, who is left on the island. The giant squid-thing, which I think is supposed to be Davey Jones's locker, attacks the Pearl. The Pearl's crew abandons ship, but Elizabeth handcuffs Sparrow to the ship and is left to the squid-thing. Sparrow gets himself free and sticks a sword right in the mouth of the squid-thing and it dies. But as he swords it, he is swallowed along with it. The heart he has taken care of went missing during the attack of the squid-thing while the crew is aboard the Pearl.Elizabeth makes up a lie about Sparrow going down with his ship. Scene changes to voodoo-like shack that was shown in the movie earlier, but no pivotal things happened in there, so I left it out. The crew of the Pearl, except Sparrow, is in the voodoo-shack talking to a voodoo-like woman with a thick accent. She tells them they should keep going and says they need someone to captain the ship who knows the waters.This is where you get confused...almost mad! You see pirate boots, CONVINCED it's Captain Jack Sparrow. But the camera shows up to the face of the one, the only, CAPTAIN BARBOSSA. FIN.It screams sequel. Almost too loudly.",Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,383574
45,tenthkingdom,Ahoy Mates!,10/10,9 July 2006,"OMG! what can I say!? Fantastic, Superb, Thrilling. POTC Dead Man's Chest was all of those things and more. I must say that if you are looking for the 2nd most thrilling ride of your life (after POTC Curse of the Black Pearl that is) then sign up for the sequel of a lifetime. The crew is back in full force and Captain Jack Sparrow is funnier than he was last time around. Orland Bloom and Keira Knightly were wonderful Pirates, and the addition of Bill Nighy as Davey Jones and Stellan Skarsgaard as Bootstrap Bill was right on the money. Ragetti and Pintel were back in full force as was the wooden eye (lol). The action sequences were over the top but not to be outdone. I got dizzy at my second showing (I sat near the front!) during the wheel sequence. Norrington is very comical and rightly has a bigger part in this one (although not as you might expect). Tom Hollander as the new Lord of Port Royal was surprising at first but welcomed. He is a fantastic actor. I Must say that Tia is a character who I think will be a major player in POTC 3. The movie got a standing ovation in both showings I saw on Friday and during the last two minutes of the movie you couldn't even hear the dialog because everyone was hooting and hollering from a surprise character appearance (and no not Keith Richards). I won't spoil it and say who but man was I cheering louder than most. All in all the movie was one of the best I have ever seen and certainly as good if not maybe better (I have to see it some more) than its predecessor.Be Sure To Stay After The Credits For A Surprise Little Bit Tying Up A Loose End From Earlier In The Movie!!!!",Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,383574
46,agmoldham,"Fairly entertaining, but a bit long",5/10,29 July 2006,"Pirates is a fairly typical blockbuster. The film was guaranteed to generate a good box office return after the success of the first movie. All the main players in the first film are back again.The film isn't particularly coherent and is really a series of set pieces. The acting isn't great, but you wouldn't really expect great acting from a cast that includes Knightly and Bloom.Having said that it's still fairly entertaining fayre and whilst Knightly and Bloom aren't the greatest of actors they look quite good. The last hour, in particular, is pretty thrilling and you get plenty of bangs for your buck!

47,l_moonshade,What a ride!,10/10,10 July 2006,"This movie is every bit as good as the first, if not better. The old characters are just as you remember them (with some changes in fortune for a couple), the new characters are wonderfully colorful and memorable, and the bad guys are delightfully evil and cunning. I loved the plot, I loved the way it played out. Jokes and snappy one-liners abound, just as witty as in the first. And, once again, Captain Jack Sparrow has one of the best introductions in movie history. The special effects were very good and everything looked realistic. The sword work was excellent, the fights both suspenseful and entertaining. And, there's a wonderful surprise at the end. If you want a movie that will make you think, this isn't really it. But, if you want a fun, entertaining movie that will take you away from reality for a little while, this is definitely the one for you. It's a great ride, and great fun.

48,atlant,"Abysmal. Appalling. Atrocious. Awful. And that's just the ""A""s...",2/10,26 December 2006,"This is clearly a movie that was made by the Disney Marketing Department. You first get that feeling at the beginning of the DVD when you're shown trailer after trailer after trailer for *OTHER MOVIES*. Is this one so bad that even the producers of the DVD are loathe to get to it?In a word: yes.There is no plot to speak of. There is no character development. (In fact, most of the characters have gone far retrograde since the first episode, and they continue to devolve throughout this episode.) There *IS* a lot of action, and as action movie action goes, it's pretty well-done. And its for that reason alone that I'm giving this movie a ""2"" rather than the ""1"" (0, -1, etc.) that it really deserves.The worst insult is that after you've wasted your time watching this tediously-long movie, you find out it's just *HALF A MOVIE*, ending in a cliff hanger so Disney can sell you ""Pirates of the Caribbean Three: The Hunt for Even More of Your Treasure."" Save your money and save your time: skip this movie.",Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,383574
49,parker-75,"""Now, I would just like to point out that this film is displaying a distinct tendency to become silly.""",10/10,1 July 2006,"From Sinbad and the Seven Seas to Jason and the Argonauts; from Odysseus and his Odyssey to Sloth and his friends the Goonies, audiences all alike have been amazed and enamored by what tales are told and brought from the depths of the sea. For someone like Ernest Hemingway the sea may bring an overwhelming feeling of complete serenity, but in the eyes of both producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Gore Verbinski all is too well known to let the sea rest that easily. And it's no more apparent than in the mind of one Captain Jack Sparrow.Captain Jack and his crew set sail, this time around, toward a course that'll lead them to an all-important chest, that only Jack knows the meaning of. The content within that chest happens to tell the sad story of one Davey Jones and his lost lady of the sea. But in order for Jack to get to the heart of things, so to speak, he must enlist the unwilling help of both Elizabeth Swann and Will Turner, yet again. With their assistance not only does Jack learn a valuable lesson in doing the right thing, but Jack ends up, unintentionally, leading both Elizabeth and Will down a path to their deepest desires.Along the way mischievous antics occur, which is likely in a movie as swashbuckling fun as a Monty Python sketch (in fact, at any moment you might expect to hear the faint sounds of two coconuts clip-clopping together). That's not to say that they weren't on a treacherous trail of danger either. There's indeed a fair share of monstrous feats and ghastly turmoil. I'm mainly referring to Davey Jones' main defense, the Kraken (after seeing it, one might reconsider their decision to ever order Calamari again). And as exciting as the Kraken was to watch, the fight sequences were just as eye-popping. However, when you think that there couldn't be any more surprises there's just one more in store. But in the manner of a great magician, a good film-goer never ruins the ending. All that can be said is that the third installment has a lot to live up to.Nothing can go wrong with a cast as energetic and enlightening as this one. Johnny Depp's portrayal of a pirate who thrives on near misses matches up perfectly with Kiera Knightley's role of a thrill seeker of a woman (which is just as enchanting as ever). Even Orlando Bloom pulls his own weight in this film filled with spectacles of great magnitude (it's as if they're all hungry to play with fire again). With the new edition of Bill Nighy (who's totally unrecognizable, yet refreshingly evil, as Davey Jones) and a bigger chunk of a part for Stellan Skarsgård to bite into as Will Turner's father, an astonishing experience for any film-goer is ensured. But not everyone may feel the same way, for one might find it hard to take the over-the-top locations and its acting another go around. Nevertheless, one man's jar of dirt is another's jar of gold.The reason why this trilogy will work, after having so much retrospection on the subject, is the very same reason why the Indiana Jones franchise (as well as the original Star Wars) worked so well. It's just too good to be true. And don't think of this movie as being better than the original, think of it as aiding in the continuation of a wonderful story and its intriguing characters. So, without any further ado, set sail and point your compass wherever your deepest infatuations take you. All the knowledge that is needed to go forward without any trouble at all, at least for a little while, is to stay starboard and afloat for as long as you can. Other than that, just keep on singing, ""Yo ho, yo ho, the pirate's life for me.""",Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,383574
50,Lady_Targaryen,Funny and very entertaining!,8/10,2 August 2006,"''Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest'''is a very nice movie!I loved it, specially because usually sequels are not so good as the first movie (''Matrix '' is an example).Not to mention that I am so glad to see Jack Sparrow again! He is the best character and pirate ever, and even not being so caring about the others like in the first film, he is still funny as usual. I also loved ''Tia Dalma'', a kind of a sorceress with a different way of smile and talking, that is very nice! I am a Disney's fan and also a fantasy's fan, so, to me, the entire trilogy looks awesome.The plot of this new movie is that we see that Captain Jack Sparrow owes a blood debt to the legendary Davy Jones, Captain of the ghostly Flying Dutchman. Davy gave the Pearl To Jack and his title of captain 13 years ago, and now he wants Jack to be part of his servants.Jack is desperate to not be another man to have a life in servitude to Davy Jones, and gives Will and his place while his tries find one hundred souls in exchange for his own. Will meet his father, who is a Davy's servant and Jack finds Davy's Chest, where in the legend about the villain, he put his heart inside.The movie has many different moments that are hard to describe without writing spoilers,but both Elizabeth and Will are furious with Jack in this movie. Only when Mr. Sparrow is taken by The Kraken, Davy's beast,they both see how important Jack is in their lives...",Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,383574

52,Pasafist,"It's big, loud, and lacks subtlety, and charm. A Hollywood blockbuster for sure.",5/10,8 July 2006,"When one attempts to create a list of the worst hack directors in Hollywood, Gore Verbinski, is in the top 3 for me (right behind Bret Ratner and Michael Bay). These men have made millions in Hollywood peddling half-hearted, and over bloated popcorn flicks for years, and have gotten very good at it. So, when the receipts start to pour in for PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: DEAD MANS CHEST, Gore Verbinski will probably laugh all the way to the bank. I ask why? Why do we as humans keep going to see movie like this? Why does the entire audience hoop, holler, and cheer? And why can't I have the fun everybody else seems to be having? DEAD MAN'S Chest begins on the wedding day of Will Turner and Elizabeth Swan. Their nuptials are ruined when they are taken into custody for the events of the original film. Will is guaranteed freedom and release for himself and his bride but only if he will retrieve a compass from Jack Sparrow, and deliver it to the evil East Indian Trading Company. This sets off a series of events that bring Will, Elizabeth, and Captian Jack Sparrow face to face with the mysterious Davey Jones and the motley crew of the Flying Dutchman. Will there be Action? Will there be Swashbuckling Adventure? Will Johnny Depp act like a Drag Queen on a harbor cruise? Of course.I can easily sum up this film in one word: adequate. It got a lot of nicely paced action sequences, some silly comedy, and there is just the right amount of peril and suspense hiding around the corner. You won't have a bad time, if you must run out and see this movie, the theater is the place. But if you were expecting a deeper more fulfilling visit with the characters of the first film, or at least a better more fleshed out story, you'll be sadly disappointed. DEAD MAN'S CHEST is just more of the same.All the characters show up say their lines, and seem to be having a good time. But there's nothing else there. Orlando Bloom is the hero, Keira Knightly is the Damsel with bite, and Johnny Depp is Johnny Depp pretending to be Keith Richards as a pirate. The screenplay does nothing to let us into their lives, their motivations serve the script only, and while they don't do a bad job, the script doesn't really ask them too. This is a point A to point B kind of a movie, every motivation serves the screenplay, not the story.As for the action scenes. There are two worth mentioning and save the film from being utterly boring. The first is an elaborate chase scene on an island with swinging cages, angry natives, and Jack Sparrow tied to a giant bamboo pole. The other scene involves a waterwheel and a ton of swashbuckling. This scene comes late enough into the movie that it almost saves the entire picture. The last fifteen minutes are a breeze because that scene really creates a lot of momentum.Director Verbinski show again that he can take pretty pictures, and stage large special effects sequences. But very little of it is groundbreaking or worth writing home about. He doesn't up the ante at all. Great sequels ask us to take the next step, to challenge what came before, or a least given the characters more depth and freshness. DEAD MAN'S CHEST is simply a two and half hour rehash of the original PIRATES film, with a less interesting villain and some anti-capitalist nonsense thrown in.The film also suffers from a running time that is just unacceptable. Like the first PIRATES film, DEAD MAN'S CHEST is a 90 minute movie stretched over two and a half hours. So much happens in this film, and so much of it is inconsequential to the plot. Because the plot in and of itself lacks any meat. This film is the middle of a planned trilogy, and since it has very few surprises, character depth, and plot revelations that I just know the third installment will be very, very lackluster.I understand that people like these kind of movies. I don't because I know that there are so many talented people out there with awesome stories to tell, and character to create. DEAD MAN'S CHEST is just a rehash of the same thing. It's big, loud, and lacks subtlety, and charm. A Hollywood blockbuster for sure. It's adequate, people will like it, but this is not a great film.",Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,383574
53,krabbit,It's all about the money,1/10,10 July 2006,"I really cannot comprehend how this movie could possibly have a 7.9 on IMDb. I would go as far to say that this movie was WORSE than The Village (which I also hated). The story picks up a bit after the last movie left off, which is probably the only good thing about the movie. After the intro, he just goes horribly wrong. The plot feels like it's pulled and twisted just so that they can stretch this movie to an uncomfortable 2.5 hours and leave the story open at the end so they can make 4 or 5 more of these atrocities. The number of plot holes created from this warped directing style just adds to the confusion of why I actually bought a ticket in the first place. Maybe, it was because I liked the first movie and expected the 2nd to not be absolute junk. I can honestly state that I will never watch another Gore Verbinski movie, seeing that having his name stamped on a movie must mark it as manure.You've bested me this time Gore Verbinski and taken me gold, it will not happen again!

54,Hitchcoc,"It's Fun, But Does Anyone Know When to Stop",8/10,20 February 2007,"Sometimes I think they sell movies by the pound. This is a pretty delightful tale. The sea creatures, the special effects, Johnny Depp's prancing, tilting Jack Sparrow, interesting rules of the sea, Davey Jones. But it is an eternity. Just like the first one, I thought it would never end. What could be much more suspenseful and captivating is dragged on for two and a half hours. A snip here and there would have done wonders for this film. One thing that always bothers me is the complexity of the hero's task; we are submerged in a whirlpool of details. At times I think the characters themselves are confused by what's going on. How could they know?Still, it's nice to see someone put forth the effort to tell a really nifty adventure yarn. The sea puts forth obstacles that we don't have on terra firma. It has its own legends and its own being, and it's really quite wet. I like the hammer head guy and the octopus-like Jones. Obviously, the makeup people put in a lot of overtime. It also sets up episode three. See it, but it's quite an investment.",Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,383574

Meanwhile, Jack is afraid of the sea, because he owes his soul to the evil Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), the Captain of the Flying Dutchmen. When Will meets Jack, the pirate proposes to exchange his compass by a key owned by Davy Jones. Will goes to the Flying Dutchman without knowing how dangerous and diabolic Davy Jones and his crew are.""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"" is another good supernatural adventure of Captain Jack Sparrow, Elizabeth Swann and Will Turner, with action, humor, romance, mystery and great special effects. The story is inferior to ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"", but is also very entertaining. Unfortunately it is does not end, actually it is interrupted in a suspenseful moment in order to have another sequel again with Captain Barbossa.

57,adudewhoiscool,"If you enjoyed the first, you will most likely enjoy this.",10/10,19 August 2006,"If you enjoyed ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" then you will enjoy the sequel just as much. This had everything that made the first one enjoyable. There is amazing sword fight/action sequences, creepy bad people created with incredible special effects, romance, humor, and of course Captain Jack Sparrow.Captain Jack Sparrow made a deal with Davy Jones. The deal was for Jack to be captain of the Black Pearl for thirteen years, then give up his sole and become a crew member of the Flying Dutchman. Those thirteen years are up, and Davy Jones is after Jack Sparrow. Will Turner, and Elizabeth Swann are also on the lookout as well. After being arrested by the British government for aiding in the escape of Sparrow, Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann are blackmailed into helping track down Jack. Lord Cutler Beckett forces them to find Sparrow and obtain a magical compass from him in exchange for pardons.There were many similarities to ""Empire Strikes Back."" This is darker compared to the first film, just as ""Empire Strikes Back"" was to ""A New Hope."" Captain Jack Sparrow has that classic Han Solo type feel, Will Turner is a lot like Luke, and even Elizabeth Swann has a similar feel to Leia. Even Ragetti, tall and skinny, and Pintel, short and round, are back and have some comedic roles, just like R2D2 and C3P0. There is a cliffhanger, which will catch most people by surprise, much like ""Empire Strikes Back"" did.Once again, there is a great villain. Davy Jones was a better villain then Captain Barbossa. What made him better was that Davy Jones a more multi-dimension character then Barbossa. Barbossa was just pure evil. At least once did you think that Davy Jones had a passionate side, but then the next scene he would do something totally brutal and evil. Davy Jones is sure to become a classic villain.The special and visual effects, once again, are top notch. From the look of Davy Jones to his henchman, it was spectacular. Davy Jones was created the same way that Gollum/Smeagol was in the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. Some of the special effects used to make his tentacles are possibly the best use of CGI ever shown on screen. Davy Jones and his crew all looked like creatures from the sea. Davy Jones' main defense, which he summons to destroy ships, was the Kracken, a giant tentacled beast with a toothy throat similar to the fictional creature called a Sarlacc from ""Star Wars VI: Return of the Jedi."" Just like in the first movie, you should expect some major sword fights, and those fights are improved.A ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movie cannot be reviewed without mentioning Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow. Once again, the rum loving pirate steals the show and shows that his character is the coolest character since Hans Solo in the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy. His introduction was humorous, but not as memorable as the first one. Hopefully, Johnny Depp is once again nominated for best actor. It will be exciting to see him and Keith Richards, who was Johnny's inspiration for Jack Sparrow, on the screen together. In case you did not know, there will be a third movie and Keith Richards will be playing Jack Sparrow's father.Some of the side characters we all knew and loved are back, such as Governor Swann (played by Jonathan Pryce), Pintel (played by Lee Arenberg), Ragetti (played by Mackenzie Crook), Mr. Gibbs (played by Kevin McNally), and Marty (played by Martin Klebba). Those people got the same amount of screen time. Norington (played by Jack Davenport) has received a bigger, more in depth role. Orlando Bloom (who plays Will Turner) has shown a little improvement and has improved quite a bit since he donned bows and arrows in the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. Keira Knightley (who plays Elisabeth Swann) has also added a little bit more to her character.The new additions are also well done. ""Bootstrap"" Bill Turner (played by Stellan Skarguard), Will Turner's father, is finally introduced and he had very nice chemistry with Will. Another interesting character was a woman named Tia Dalma (played by Naomie Harris). She was very strange and was possibly even weirder (maybe just more mysterious and unknown) then Jack. Maybe they will explain more about her back-story in the next chapter. Of course, we know about Davy Jones (played by Bill Nighy).If you are looking for the perfect summer popcorn movie, you are in the right place. This was just as enjoyable as the first movie. This is must see on the big screen and hopefully you do not forget to leave until after the credits. Bring your family, bring your friends, and do not forget to start singing, ""Yo ho, yo ho, the pirates life for me."" ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"" is very recommended!",Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,383574

59,de_niro_2001,Great!,10/10,8 May 2007,"The pace of this sequel never flags. It's entertainment from start to finish. There's plenty of action and a cast full of colourful characters. The special effects are marvellous and when you see the kraken you can see how much special effects have progressed since It Came From Beneath The Sea. This tentacles are incredibly lifelike. In the scenes on the Flying Dutchman you can smell the stench of the salty sea air, the seaweed and the shellfish. It was interesting to learn that Davy Jones is actually a CGI image. When I first saw the film I thought it was Bill Nighy in a costume and only the maggot-like tentacles round his face were an effect. He gives a great performance. At the end of this film one can detect a Princess Leia-Han Solo-Luke Skywalker triangle forming between the main characters. We'll see how this progresses in the next film which is out in a few weeks.",Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,383574
60,pimpdawg55566678,I liked it better then the first!!!!,10/10,10 July 2006,"Dead Mans Chest far surpassed my wildest expectations. I don't think I have ever had so much fun at the movies. It may start off slow but once it picks up it rarely slows down. It is one wild ride.First and foremost this movie is a lot darker then the first. The themes are darker, the tone is darker, the environment is more mysterious and suspenseful. This in my opinion really is what makes it superior to the first film. The first film in my opinion was more lighthearted and kid friendly. This on the other hand has a lot more mature elements.Second the fighting and action sequences are more violent and intense. They are also a lot longer (This is not a bad thing in my opinion.) The best fight of the entire movie is near the end when Will, Jack and the former Commodore Norrington are fighting on the water wheel. Not only is it just fun to watch there are also more fights going on at the same time (Mainly Elizabeth and the two pirates whose names I do not recall are fighting Davy Jones crew.) The entire scene is simply amazing. Next would probably be the crew of the Black Pearl fighting the Kracken. It is a very intense fight and also an awesome fight. I really liked it a lot.Third the humor in this one is a lot funnier and there is more of it. The funniest part of the whole movie is probably on the island full of cannibals. It is an awesome and hilarious part of the movie. Jack vs. the fruit throwing Moms is hilarious. Then him falling threw every single bridge. I tell you there really is nothing funnier then that entire scene and the sequence of events that take place.Fourth the special effects are amazing. They are easily the best so far this year and are likely the best since ROTK and COBP. Davy Jones is simply stunning. You won't even be able to tell when the make up stops and the effects begin. It looks that real. The only scene where it looks a little more animated is when Jack is getting ready to go head on into the kracken.Fifth the acting is even better then the first. Depp does an excellent job and deserves an award. Knightely is simply beautiful. Bloom also does a decent job. Nighy really steals the show though. He does an excellent as Davy Jones and he at the very least deserves an award for best supporting actor. I mean he really did a fantastic job.All in all this movie is far better then anyone could have hoped or dreamed of. It is easily the best movie of the summer. I hope it does extremely well at the box office because it deserves every penny.",Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,383574
61,Doylenf,Rollicking good fun...some wonderful escapes...but a bit overlong...,7/10,2 August 2006,"Darker than the first film, and even more episodic, is PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN with Johnny Depp reprising his role as Captain Jack Sparrow. He holds the spotlight most of the time even though he is up against some of the most fantastic looking creatures a make-up man ever devised. Hideous as they are, it's hard to look away when they come on the screen. The cinematography is stunning, but the fast clip of scenes is overdone and gets wearying after awhile.ORLANDO BLOOM and KEIRA KNIGHTLEY do nicely as hero and heroine, the sort of pair that harks back to the days of Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland. Miss Knightley has a beautiful face but not quite the warmth of personality this sort of heroine should have. Orlando Bloom looks good with a sword but needs more work with his acting abilities.The busy, overly orchestrated score by Hans Zimmer pounds away at the music in what must be the most overwritten score of the year. Dialog manages to be clear enough except for Naomi Harris who mumbles some inexplicable heavily accented words as the exotic Tia Dalma that should have required sub-titles for all their blurriness.Most fun are the chase scenes wherein Bloom and others are locked inside some sort of a rolling wheel-barrel--but all of the special effects are handsomely staged for maximum effect. And surely, an army of stuntmen must have been kept busy on the sound stages for all of the action scenes.Depp's character is given some questionable things to do. His moral compass is not quite what it ought to be, even if he is the anti-hero of this swashbuckling epic. And much of the action scenes could have been trimmed to bring the story in at a length less than two-and-a-half hours. Perhaps with some of the action trimmed, there would have been time for more emphasis on exposition, especially for those who never saw the first film.Aside from these minor reservations, it's highly enjoyable entertainment for those wanting to escape the summer heat and looking for more than two hours of pirate fantasy with stunning special effects and photography.",Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,383574
62,Smarios44,I wanted to cry,10/10,14 August 2006,"I LOVED IT!!!!! Everyone in the movie was suited to play that role. It is just the end almost made me wanna cry. Barbossa walks in to help find Jack and the Crakken and the movie ENDS!!!! How much does that stink??? I wanted to cry I needed to know what happens..... and also it was very funny. AMAZING visual effects. Davy Jones mask looked so real. This movie has some of the best visual effects I have ever seen with the exception of the 10th Kingdom. Anyway, I recommend this movie to everyone. It was also very funny. Also I thought the man who played the evil guy who wanted Jack's compass was a very good actor but I didn't like his part.",Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,383574
63,Galina_movie_fan,I loved it:,8/10,8 July 2006,"I probably would've loved it even more if it were 20-30 minutes shorter in the middle but as it is - great fun. Jack is back and he is magnificent -drunk most of the time, his morals as unstable as his walk, lying, seducing, running, hanging by his leg on the rope, and always irresistible. Depp's Capt. Sparrow is the reason to see the movie but there is so much more. The movie's last hour is simply awesome and the way its creators prepared us for the third film is very clever. I am happy that one of my favorite characters from the first movie made the appearance and will be the part of this trilogy (?) final(?) chapter. The film is exiting, has stunning special effects and I am sure that the make up artists will be nominated for all possible awards in the end of the year (they deserve them all). I will not mention the plot - it is there but it's not that important after all. The film is a rare case of equal opportunity entertainment and enjoyment - for the young children, their parents, cynical teenagers, sophisticated intellectuals, rednecks - for everybody and their uncle Max.8.5/10",Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,383574
64,PizzicatoFishCrouch,Sloppy. Sloppy.,5/10,18 August 2006,"I sat through Pirates of the Caribbean II without any particular expectations, and it was probably better than way, because, had I looked forward to it, I think I would have walked out feeling very, very disappointed. Where the first film was fun, fresh, entertaining and showed flashes of brilliance, the second has been put together with far less consideration to the art of film-making, and with more of an interested eye for the bank statements.The performances range from acceptable to atrocious. Depp gives his Captain Jack Sparrow the same humour and alcohol-addled craziness that he did with the first. This is both and bad; whilst he is fun to watch and occasionally near-funny, there are hardly any surprises. Pride & Prejudice's Tom Hollander is the shining star of this film, and steals every single scene he's in, a feat made more impressive if you consider that his character is one of the most poorly written of all time. Orlando Bloom is absolutely, horrifyingly, frighteningly awful, and one wonders how good an agent he must have bagged himself to continue getting himself film roles when he's just so bad. And to round off this acting ""ensemble,"" is Keira Knightley, who seems to want the world to forget that she has given an Oscar-nominated performance. It doesn't help that Elizabeth Swann is no Elizabeth Bennet, but Knightley is so utterly frustrating in her constant pouting that one can't help wishing that her character will quickly disappear.Plot holes are rife and ridiculous. For five whole minutes, I sat there, puzzling over just how did Elizabeth become such a dab hand at swordplay? But the biggest plot hole comes at the end, where you can practically hear Bruckheimer's purse strings anticipating a stretch. Like the rest of the film, the score is below-par, with Hans Zimmer carelessly shoving together the leftovers from his scores to The Da Vinci Code and Gladiator. But the icing on the distasteful cake here is the sloppy, sloppy, screenplay, which made me groan at least 10 times, a record only matched by films such as Crash (2004) and Signs. From the lame jokes as old as the Black Pearl to the clunky, laughable dialogue, there's a rusty jewel of a bad screen writing feat achieved in always every minute of running time. That 4 people were involved in the writing makes the script even more shameful; they were clearly drunk the entire time.I make it sound as if the film has no saving grace. Admittedly, this is not quite true. Pirates of the Caribbean II: Dead Man's Chest does not set out to be a masterpiece, it aims to be entertainment, and there are the odd moments of surprise and amusement to be found. Some of the undersea scenes invoke the same ghoulishness as felt with the first, and, at times, you can leave you brain at home and attempt to enjoy it. But then I remember the simple thing that is logic, and this film is certainly lacking in it.",Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,383574
65,johnnymonsarrat,"Jon Monsarrat review: Vastly over-rated, like The Mummy",4/10,13 July 2006,"I love action movies, even if they're stupid, but I really can't say enough bad things about Pirates of the Caribbean Part 2.Let's start with the complete lack of chemistry between Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley. Or Bloom's character and his father. Or Keira's character and her father. Or everyone and Jack Sparrow. Sparrow staggers around the film like he's drunk or just deranged. It's supposed to be cute but it makes him an anti-hero and it just didn't work for me.The special effects are totally misused. They could have looked creepy and made me frightened. But the undersea Davey Jones monsters look comical instead, and not in a good way, rather in a way that pulled me out of the movie so I could not really engage with it.To add to that, the plot lines don't make any sense. People are always pledging loyalty and servitude to each other, running around after various artifacts, and so forth. At one point, without spoiling the plot, there's a dice game involving pledges and oaths that made no sense to me whatsoever. It was so complicated and there's such a large cast of characters I really couldn't figure anything out. Everyone's fighting everyone else too, and it's like they can't decide whether to fight or be friends or fight again. The implausible character decisions combined with all the superstitious muckety-muck reminds me very much of the film The Mummy. ""Let's get the golden chalice into the water of doom before the clock ticks midnight because the silver bat of Davey Jones needs to feed on the insects of horror"". OK, whatever, people.Finally, instead of ending the film with some kind of closure, it turns out the entire movie is just a setup for the next film. I wanted to leave half-way through but my date kept me there, hoping the film would get better. Unfortunately, it doesn't get any better. If you go and you don't like the first 10 minutes, just leave. Or better yet, stay away.Who should see this film:-- Nobody, except maybe kids because they're too naive to know junk when they see it-- Anyone who enjoyed Independence Day and The Mummy, you're good people just entirely lacking in taste I'll give this film a 4 out of 10, and it would have been lower except I did enjoy a small fraction of the humor and action.",Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,383574
66,freebe1,ahh!,10/10,8 August 2006,"I loved it! I thought it was one of the best movies I have ever seen! Will was as hot as ever, Jack was supper funny and Elizibeth got in the action more. One of my favorite parts was when Jack looked like he was a fruit kabob, and then he fell and everything on the kabob fell right around Jack. I also liked the scene when Elizibeth was on the boat of sailors besides Jack and Will and the sailors thought the ship was haunted. The love scene with Jack and Elizibeth had me freaked out, I was like screaming at my cousin ""I can't wait till May, I need to see it now"" all because Will and Elizibeth got mad at each other, all over Jack. In the end, I thought it was great.",Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,383574
67,sam_117,One hour too long,1/10,9 July 2006,"I liked Johnny Depp in the first film, and the first film was not that bad. So now for this sequel. The special effects were good, the sets and costumes were good. But there is a limit to how many special effects, sword fights and chase scenes that mean absolutely nothing that I can sit through. If they had cut away one hour of meaningless effects and never ending action sequences the movie would have been watchable. Johnny Depp was really in character but even his character was too busy running around to showcase his personality. Finally, this movie is not a movie, it is a part 1 of 2 series that just stops in the middle of nowhere. There is no ending, just a ""see you in two years when you have to pay another 10 bucks to see the ending"". All in all, the producers seem to think that as long as there is a lot of action, a story or any presence of drama is not required. Awful film.",Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,383574

It was magnificent, witty, rich in the values which make a film a classic.However ""Dead Man's Chest"" is just plain awful. Where were the original writers? All on vacation somewhere else? These guys had no real plot and chose to fill the time with really valueless retreads from their own lives and much better films. I believe that: 1. More than one in the group had a gerbil who rolled around in a wheel.2. Someone had watched the marvelous Douglas Fairbanks' classic ""Black Pirate"" film and lifted the ship boarding and sword fighting sequences (here done with less daring do and swashbuckling).3. Someone was enamored of all the ""neat tricks"" that computer graphics made possible.My advice - don't waste your time.

I walked into this movie with low expectations, and came out wanting it to be May 2007 already. This movie was a lot better than the first one. I am crazy about Johnny Depp, and he is the perfect person to play the hammy Captain Jack Sparrow, who owes a debt to the legendary Davy Jones (Bill Nighy, who is unrecognizable). He has to find the key to the chest that holds Davy Jones' heart and destroy the heart. He recruits his old friends, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) to help him on his journey. On the way, Will has a family reunion with his father, ""Bootstrap"" Bill Turner.

70,joshduggan,(Spoiler Alert) This film is like having a fat man who ate at IHOP run a marathon and then drop a diarrhea dump on your chest and proceed to use your face as toilet paper,1/10,10 July 2006,"I should preface this review by saying that I was indifferent as to how I might feel about this film going into it. I thought the first film was fairly good. It was entertaining, but nothing that made me yearn for a second one. That being said, I hadn't read a review of this film (and still haven't) and had only heard that it had received mixed reviews. I had tempered expectations going into the theater, but I was certainly open to a good time.A good time was not had. This film was quite simply awful. I have not seen anything in a long time that made me marvel at the fact that it was actually the finished product of a gigantic summer film churned out by a Hollywood Studio. I saw X-Men 3. While that was dreadful, this was eons past X3 in terms of excrement put to celluloid.The plot was akin to a second-grader's class project. There was zero character development and not a single moment in which you thought you were seeing an original thought projected onto the screen. While it is a sequel, at some point the things that happen to the characters should matter, and if something bad happens to a character, the events that have molded him or her to that point should affect the audience somehow. Instead, the tools responsible for this screenplay have events happen without emotionally investing the audience in any way, shape, or form as to the fate of the characters on-screen, simply hoping that writing an event will somehow tug at the heart-strings of the audience without ever having to earn it.I don't know that it is entirely the filmmakers' fault, because it seems that Verbinski & Co. were tied to some P.O.S. script that was churned out in a matter of days to get the cameras rolling, so Disney could bend the movie-goer over and sodomize them while getting paid for it. In the place of an actual story, they were probably told to blow up the film with mind-numbing action sequences and lame special effects.To add insult to injury, the film clocks in at a mere two-and-a-half hours, which for a film with a plot wouldn't bother me in the least, but when you can write out the entire plot of this film in a matter of moments, seeing that paper-thin storyline stretched into 150 minutes is unbearable.I could even make an exception to all of the aforementioned gripes and say that there was something in the film worthwhile if there was one performance from the cast that was mildly amusing. Alas, there is not. The actors all seem to have mailed it in, including Depp, who had a single chuckle-worthy moment as a follow-up to an Oscar-nominated turn in the previous Pirates outing.***********SPOILER ALERT*************** When it comes down to it, all you'll get from this film is an obscenely long prologue to Pirates of the Caribbean 3: The Search for Spock--I mean Jack, because the entire plot of this atrocious piece of refuse is enough to fill a mere introduction to a real story.",Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,383574
71,markline-2,This one is a REAL film,9/10,20 July 2006,"that is the best way i can describe this one. in the first the characters were hollow, in Dead Man's Chest you actually feel for the characters and they are alive. in PEARL, all that kept that bloated crock, to steal a great summary from peter travers, was DEPP almost mocking, insane, and brilliant performance as JACK.in this film, the story is stronger. it is darker, and the acting from all is better, seeming to realize that their is REAL conflict going on, as much as can be in this type of film.The extra serious and darker tone adds what i thought was the biggest loss from the first one, and that was how silly and corny it was at one time and then how overly serious certain parts were trying to be and were almost laughable.in DEAD MAN's CHEST, the corny stuff works with the story and doesn't seem so placed, and the serious tone is not forced, it IS the tone, and backed up by dark characters, betrayal, and conflicts.IT is a GREAT, popcorn film, with a truly unforeseen cliffhanger and punch to the gut....",Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,383574
72,ben-812,2.5 hours of my life I won't see again,1/10,12 July 2006,"Like most of the planet, I loved the original Pirates film. This film however was not a worthy sequel. Plot ? There isn't one. I could put spoilers in this review, but it would make no difference as the plot is essentially a device to go from one CGI scene to another. It's a shame when there is acting talent available, big budgets but the most important thing - a story - is completely missing. I would advise anyone with more than 2 brain cells to avoid seeing this film; and as for other reviewers who have compared it to ""The Empire Strikes Back"", I'll have some of what you are on, because you must be out of your mind. This is at least as bad as the second Matrix film, which says it all; if I could have walked out without upsetting my 10 year old daughter, I would have done. She'll have to go and see PotC 3 without me next year; life's too short for this bilge.

The actors, including Johnny Depp, seem to just be completing their contract obligations, and the director has absolutely NO, em, direction. Nothing makes sense, everything is overdone and the jokes are all parodically rubbish.This is a classic example of fitting the plot around the characters and effects, rather than the other way around.

I am an enormous Johnny Depp fan and so of course I had to see the very first session of this movie. The main question I wanted answered was, ""Would this movie live up to the legend that was The Curse of the Black Pearl?""I am pleased to tell you that not only does this movie live up to the BP, it exceeds it. DMC is amazing!! The acting is exquisite, the special effects are astonishing, the music is inspiring, the jokes are endless, the storyline is flawless and the ending leaves you satisfied though still wanting more and wishing that we were just a little bit closer to May, 2007.The characters in this film are just as amazing and intricate as the first. There are the main characters, each with their goals, priorities and little quirks to go along with it.The costumes and sets are amazing. Each character has an individual quality and looks authentic for their person. The islands of the Caribbean act as a playground for each scene, complimenting the storyline and actors.I heard a bad review of this movie before it's premiere date and I thought I may be in for a disappointment. How wrong I was.Go and see this movie as soon as you can. It will push fans of the first film to further heights and will make fans of those who haven't seen the first (though I cannot imagine why they haven't).

I assumed that the sequel would be masterfully written, acted, and directed, like the original. I was disappointed to discover that this movie is more like a circus. Its filled with special effects and lots of 'jackie chan'-like action, but not much of a plot, and not much character development either. If your looking for a movie with a plot, or even creative writing, maybe you should look somewhere else. But if your looking for a rush, maybe this movie is for you.

It had action, adventure, laughs, and it was all around a good time. I would advise, though, that you should be 13 or over to view this movie.

However two and a half hours tests the limits of this viewer's attention span. Maybe too many stars needed too much camera time...maybe so much was spent on budget, had to show it all...who knows? Like I said, loved the first movie, and would recommend this one, too. But don't say I didn't warn you on the time thing. If you wear a watch, you will look at it more than once. That would have been my entire review, but apparently there is a minimum lines of text, so I will continue. Johnny Depp is fantastic as usual. The special effects were amazing, and the villains quite creepy. I won't spoil the ending, but I will tell you--I smell sequel.

78,mlsandal,my thoughts,8/10,9 July 2006,"I went to see Dead Man's Chest last night. It was a packed theater. A few people were even dressed for the occasion, swords and all. As soon as the film began, I was hooked. From the moment CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow made his entrance (I cheered) to the shocker at the very end, I loved every minute. Most everyone else did as well. If this was a stand-alone movie, I might have been disappointed because of the ""here comes the sequel"" cliffhanger. But as part II of a trilogy, it works wonderfully. It was darker, funnier, and the various sea battles, swordfights, and escapes were creative and exciting. I appreciated how the director balanced the serious dialogue with slapstick comedy so well. Davy Jones' crew were gross and unpleasant to look at, but that was the point. They're trapped in a watery hell, they're not exactly going to have faces like Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley (people who complained about the ugly pirates probably went to the film just to ""ooh"" at the two actors listed above). The plot was a little hard to follow, but if you pay attention, you'll be alright. I had no problem with the violence and I believe it was done tastefully, not gory or graphic. It's a PG-13 movie based on an idea of Uncle Walt's, not some soccer mom's home video of the ride in Disneyland. I say kudos to the Disney company for having taken such a chance three years ago with The Curse of the Black Pearl. It's about time they realized that most of their original customers have grown up and want things a little more mature from the main Mouse. By the way, Johnny Depp is an incredible actor. Jack Sparrow just might be my favorite franchise movie character since Indiana Jones (incidentally, Spielberg would be proud of this film I think. It feels a lot like Raiders of the Lost Ark at sea). The CGI was top-notch. I really believed there was a giant squid crushing those ships, and as mentioned before, the crew of the Flying Dutchman were delightfully creepy. I don't know if I can wait for the final installment.",Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,383574
79,Death_Berry324,Dead Man's Chest holds a true treasure within...,10/10,6 July 2006,"Having previewed this movie and seeing all of the previous blockbuster hits of this summer...I'd have to say POTC lives up to the hype. Everything we've loved about the first one is brought back and improved upon. Johnny Depp is yet again adding to the list of brilliant performances with the role of Captain Jack Sparrow. But a change is in the air...as Bill Nighy is very close to upstaging Mr. Depp with his role of the dreaded Davy Jones. Plus, towards the end we're given something that'll probably have you in an uproar! And I don't mean one in a bad way because THIS will have you talking until the third one! It's going to be a long wait till the World's End but we've set sail to something so grand. I haven't been the biggest fan of Disney but they've won me over with this series. Again, with that ending you better keep that popcorn off your lap because I jumped up at that...well, wouldn't you like to know...",Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,383574
80,supertom-3,Great fun.,7/10,2 August 2006,"Yet another sequel! Capn' Jack returns for another adventure, and this time the scale is ginormous! If you thought Pirates 1 was action packed, and spectacular, this film goes far beyond with massive sets, brilliant effects, and a massive 2 and a half hour running time, that will have you leaving the theatre feeling like you've spent a year in the harshest prison, wearing a ballerina's outfit, with a bull's-eye painted on your rear. Now the scale is huge, and there's all the lavish extravagance that Bruckheimer loves to give his punters, but the story lacks some cohesion, and it's all a bit too much, without much in the way of character depth. That could be an unfair nitpicking for a film entitled Pirates of the Caribbean sure, but the film is little more than a rollicking and fun night out at the cinema. It's not going to adorn top 100 lists of film buffs around the world that's for sure.However this is the second in a series of films that should be predominantly about fun, spectacle, and pure entertainment. In this regard Pirates 2 more than delivers, while maybe lacking the ingenuity and surprise factor of the first movie which, mainly thanks to Johnny Depp, took the public by storm. Depp once again is superb, despite giving one of his least interesting performances, as of course this is the first time ever, he's reprised a role, and Depp of course is renowned for doing startlingly different roles from one film to the next. It actually seems incredibly strange to see Depp treading old ground, still his creation of Jack Sparrow is superb. Orlando Bloom again is in the film for little more than to play the straight man to Depp, and to look good for the ladies. It's not a great role for Bloom, who as yet hasn't proved just whether he's going to be a top actor or not, or merely a pretty boy. To some extent the same is true of Keira Knightly, who come mud, sweat, grime, or rain, or dragged up as a boy, looks phenomenal. However while this role offers little for Keira she has already proved she's going to be a great actress (one Oscar nod to her name already!). On one regard though Bloom and Knightley at least have more to do in this film, and Depp is allowed to step back every now and again. This isn't merely the Depp show, which is arguably to the films detriment. The rest of the cast are good, but it's Bill Nighy who steals the show managing to convey an amazingly expressive performance from behind his squiddy CGI mask.All in all Pirates 2 delivers all you could want in a fantasy adventure. The story gets muddle in amongst all the swordfights and giant sea creatures, but still for pure fun at the movies, you can't go far with this. I most certainly look forward to Pirates 3. ***1/2",Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,383574
81,madam_Q,"Great fun, not without its flaws",8/10,29 July 2006,"Middle installments of trilogies often tend to suffer, especially when the original was not necessarily made with a sequel in mind. There are, however, exceptions to the rule. Put ""The Empire Strikes Back"" on the opposite side of the sequel coin to ""Matrix Reloaded"" - there most decidedly IS a precedent for second films emerging from the shadows of their predecessors.Thus my hopes when I went in to see ""Dead Man's Chest"" were reasonably high. The fact that all of the original cast had returned, along with quality additions like Stellan Skarsgard and Bill Nighy, only buoyed my optimism. And surely Johnny Depp wouldn't have let himself be pulled into any old crap, contractual obligation or no.Like ""The Empire Strikes Back"" this is a considerably darker affair than the all out fun of the original. The themes dealt with here are more somber - betrayals and double crossings are commonplace even among the good guys, and issues of mortality dealt with by Davey Jones and his crew make them far more frightening than the villains of the original - indeed, Barbossa and his men look almost cartoonish by comparison. There are some real scares here, and this is definitely not a film that I'd recommend to parents with young children, bladder busting running time aside.Not to say its all gloom and doom. Definitely not. The visual effects are virtually flawless, and the action set pieces - particularly a three way sword fight between Jack, Will and Norrington while Elizabeth throws a temper tantrum (not to mention rocks) on the sidelines is fantastic. The script is great, not only containing a good measure of great one liners (of which Captain Jack predictably gets the lion's share) but also real deepening of relationships between the characters. Jack and Elizabeth in particular. Ragetti and Pintel are great fun, trading on their great rapport like they did in the original, and Norrington finally gets to be something other than a ""prat in a wig"" (as the lovably self deprecating Jack Davenport described himself in a magazine interview).Inevitably, it lacks the freshness and the ""wow"" factor of the original. But there's nothing the filmmakers could have done to avoid that. Because, lets face it, nobody expected the original to be as successful as it was. A Disney flick based on a theme park ride starring Edward Scissorhands, Legolas and the skinny chick from ""Bend it Like Beckham""? Who knew? Pleasingly, though, there's no sense of anybody resting on their laurels - in particular I had dreaded Jack's antics skirting into caricature territory but Depp is, of course, far too ""savvy"" an actor to fall into that trap.The ending, like that of ""Back to the Future Part II"", is predictably a cliffhanger ensuring that everybody and their dog (or monkey) will drag themselves back to see part three, but oddly the feeling of being manipulated is somehow all part of the fun. And if part three is even anywhere near the quality of part two....we're in for an awesome ride...",Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,383574
82,andersox,Felt like I was spending an eternity in Davy Jones' Locker,1/10,14 July 2006,"This is one of the most boring movies I've seen. It's on par with ""Howard the Duck."" If you go with friends or with a date, you'll pray for the film to be over. You'll want to gnaw off your limbs to escape the theater. Johnny Depp is his sexy, mischievous self, but there's just so much mincing and pouting a man can do and still be appealing.The CGI is really remarkable but, again, there's just so many times that one can look at Mr. Tentacle Face and his school of undead pirates and be awed by computer animation.Save your money and save your time; otherwise, you'll feel like you've been cursed to spend eternity watching ""Pirates II.""",Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,383574
83,troy-daniel-bush,"It was better in my memory, but...",5/10,24 July 2022,"I don't think it's a bad movie, as evidenced by my rating.Depp, as per typical, is entertaining as Sparrow.Bill Nighy steals the show for me. He brings a lot of character and energy to Davy Jones. And the design for Davy Jones is awesome! As are all of the designs for his crew members.All of the acting is good.There are some really fun action scenes.The music is great, just like in all of them.Some of the jokes are funny.And for a movie made in 2006 the special effects hold up very well, especially with the Kraken. And man does the music during that scene kick so much ass!The biggest problem with this movie is that it's too long and there is so much unnecessary stuff in it. Like the sequence with the cannibal tribe, that could have been cut out completely. And there are subplots that I think make the movie convoluted. Which means you would have to remove Will and Elizabeth but it's not like that would be a terrible thing. They're not bad characters it's just they don't need to be in it. I feel like the movie would be better if it was more simple like the first one.And some of the CGI for Jones' crew shows its age but it's not distracting at any point.",Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,383574
84,trelaina,Critics be d@mned,9/10,10 July 2006,"I have no idea what bias drove many critics to pan this film, but don't pay them any attention. If anything, they made the film's experience BETTER for me by causing me to anticipate a dud. The sequel to Black Pearl did not disappoint AT ALL. I loved it...as did my husband. The only negative comment I can muster is towards a particular line in the film, which I felt a bit cheesy (SLIGHT SPOILER ahead): ""Why is the rum always gone?"". Other than that, references to the previous film were amusing and all the actors delivered stellar performances. I'm so glad that Johnny loves this character as much as his audience, and is willing to do more films. Disney really has a winner in the Pirates series, and they did nothing but seal the deal for our purchasing the DVD and eagerly anticipating the next sequel. As I said in my subject line...critics, take a note: you don't speak for the population. And if you're still not convinced...take a look at the box office.

85,nyironhorse,Awful,1/10,10 July 2006,"Well, it made a record $132 Million opening weekend and that means only one thing: a lot of really disappointed people. I enjoyed the first movie, but I wasn't what you would call a fan. My wife dragged me along to this one and I relented mostly because of the poor reviews for Superman, which I would have rather seen.Pirates II wasn't funny and it was totally self-indulgent. The editor is a genius, basically because he figured out how to get paid without actually doing any work. Almost every scene without fail had five to ten seconds of crap on each end of the action. The run time was way too long (which could have been remedied with cuts in appropriate places). For an action movie, it doesn't say much that I got bored on two separate occasions, finding myself searching for the remote.The first movie was redeemed by a fantastic script and solid wit. The sequel had neither. I saw an interview with Johnny Depp in which he claimed to be willing to do ""eight of these movies if the scripts remain as good as the second one."" LIAR, LIAR, LIAR. I love Depp, but he will forever be a sell-out in my book if he continues to insist that this is a well made movie. I'm totally OK with actors making crap for the money so long as they acknowledge that they did it for the money.The only thing that could have possibly redeemed this movie would have been extended gratuitous shots of Keira Knightly just standing around or doing basically anything. For a movie that didn't know when to edit a scene, there were surprisingly few of these shots. It also didn't help that at some point near the end of the film, she gained an ugly, obviously fake tan out of nowhere.All in all this movie was bad, but it wasn't so poorly made as to become entertaining in its badity. This is the worse kind of film to watch. That being said, I'm definitely looking forward to the third one; at this rate it will be exceedingly awful and possibly awful enough to be entertainingly bad.",Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,383574
86,judywalker2,"Some of the critics were right, Pirates#1=fun, Pirates #2=dumb",3/10,11 July 2006,"When I saw the first teaser trailer I definitely had my doubts about this movie. Whe I saw the full trailer I had more. I read some of the early critics opinions and had even more. When it opened and I saw the rest of the review I took heart in the fact that a lot of the critics like it (just goes to show you) and of course when it beat the records I just knew I should hurry to see it. Well I was wrong. This movie was just dumb it was really bad. From the opening shot to the closely ""to be continued"" I just wanted to yell, ""let me out of this HELL!"" You know the Mummy and The Mummy Returns at least had the good sense to keep in the sequel what we liked about the first movie; it even built upon it, a little. This movie not only threw away everything we liked about the first movie, it then had the nerve to add everything we hate about movies period. Let me list them: No Decent Plot, No worthwhile villain (unless you count Norington), Stupid Effects, Creature features and Teenager gross-outs. And not to mention no decent romance. I didn't give too hoots for any of these characters. Banish them all to Davy Jones Locker, please. 3/10

87,nick_rippon,What a movie should be!,9/10,5 July 2006,"Arriving hours early was worth it to be first in line to see this film - As good as, if not better than the first film, special effects abound, sinister new characters are uncovered, spectacular stunts and fights on several occasions, all with an unexpected cliffhanger ending only adding to the suspense of waiting a year the third in the series! This will not disappoint!I have dubbed this the ""Empire Strikes Back"" of our era (even if some friends of mine consider that to be either an overstatement of the film or an understatement of Star Wars), but never the less this was a fantastic film which I'll be seeing more than I saw the first film, which, if I told you how many times I saw it, you'd all tell me to go get a life.

88,Spaceygirl,Overblown and overlong,5/10,28 December 2006,"Hmmm...I really wanted to enjoy this. I LOVED the first one! Johnny Depp is the coolest pirate in the world and Orli is just gorgeous BUT Keira Knightley is just the most overrated actress on the planet. (Barring Scarlett Johannsen) Dead Mans Chest is just too long and overdone. While it does have some magnificent set-pieces, it's just TOO MUCH! The giant wheel scene goes on and on and on and on and on....... The script is bog-standard and the acting okayish. Bill Nighy steals every scene he's in though. Gotta love him!

89,krycek19,And yet another sequel made only to make more money,1/10,27 March 2008,"I hate this movie as well as the third installment. The plot is non-existent. Jack Sparrow is too goofy and have almost no serious scenes in the entire film. And I hate that they bring back Captain Barbossa in the end. He was a great villain in the first one but why the hell bring him back when we got new villains?? He's character played it self out in the first movie and should'nt have been brought back.Gore Verbinski should be ashamed for agreeing to make sequels without something called decent scripts.I can't blame Johnny Depp, for signing on for sequels, as he had a lot of fun on the first film and probably was given a lot of money for the sequels. And Depp has always made weird movies his entire career, so he is probably not very well paid.Just like with the Matrix sequels, pretend the sequels don't exist and just enjoy the original movie, which is truly a masterpiece.",Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,383574
90,xolovethatboyox,This movie's ending was a black mark against Disney (contains spoilers),1/10,17 July 2006,"Fans of Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl have been waiting patiently for the next movie to come out. Quite frankly, this movie was not worth waiting three years for. Davy Jones and the Island scenes seemed like two different movies. This movie didn't solve anything. Norrington was the only character that grew. Jack Sparrow's character was changed from a crooked good man to. . . I don't even know. His character was extremely shallow and humorless. It felt as though a two year old designed his character. The characters that we knew and loved became warped in this movie. Will just sulked his way through the movie, and I don't even know what was up with Elizabeth. And what was with that horrible ending? Asking if they wanted to go on a new adventure was lame, a letdown, and a horrible way to finish off the movie.The only good thing I can see about this movie is that there is no way the third one can be any worse. All in all, the movie Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest was not worth paying the money to go see it.",Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,383574
91,rikctid,Can't help but feel disappointed,7/10,6 July 2006,"I loved the first POTC and am a big fan of Johnny Depp's movies, and indeed the man himself is pretty much flawless again in this sequel. My gripe really centres around the unnecessarily complicated plot and the overall length of the film. Unlike the film adaptations of Harry Potter and the Lord of the Rings trilogy there is nothing in the screenplay to really justify the bum-numbing 150 minutes spent watching this film, particularly as the plot takes so long to get going. The major set pieces involving the island cannibals and the key to Davy Jones' locker are good but seriously in need of editing, and although the CGI effects are impressive, there really is only so many times you can marvel at the 'beastie' before its time to stifle the yawns. Anyone who saw King Kong and experienced midway restlessness will probably recognise similar symptoms here too. That said, the performances by the lead actors are excellent and although the script doesn't seem to provide the same number of laughs found in the first film, this is generally not a poor sequel. Expectation gained from the first film is likely to be an issue when assessing the merits of the sequel and most fans of JD will not be too disappointed, I just hope this 'trilogy' does a 'Back to the Future' and ends with a pacey flourish, rather than a further need for pressure-relieving cushions.",Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,383574
92,spacemonkey_fg,Fun entertaining special effects fest,10/10,14 August 2006,"Gotta be honest, the first Pirates of the Caribbean flick didn't really do it for me. Before you start firing your cannons at me or plan on starting a mutiny, allow me to explain myself. The first Pirates of the Caribbean, was well directed and made and all that, but as far as story goes, I found it a big bore for some reason. Of course this has nothing to do with Johnny Depps masterful, memorable and Oscar nominated performance as Jack Sparrow which I loved right from the get go. So, I was one of those guys who thought that the only saving grace that the first movie had was Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow. Now after the enormous success of the first one here comes the bigger sequel. In other words, if Dead Mans Chest follows the rules of being the sequel to a successful film right, we should get more of everything. More effects, more action, more comedy! More Jack Sparrow! I'm glad to say the film successfully achieved all of these and then some! This time around Jack Sparrow is running away from a supernatural evil pirate called Davey Jones. You see, Jack owes Davey Jones his soul, but of course Jack being the sleaze bag trickster that he is doesn't want to pay up what he owes. Instead he chooses to run away and find a way to destroy Davey Jones and his crew of half human half fish pirates. This enrages Davey who conducts a search for Jack across the seven seas, leading us to a cannibal infested island, giant octopuses and strange half man half fish creatures.Little did I suspect that this was going to be the best movie of the summer. I mean literally, it took me by surprise. The big anticipation this summer for me was Superman which for various reasons I wont get into here was great and at the same time disappointing. But here comes Pirates of the Caribbean blowing me away. As this film progressed I realized what a huge production it was, everything is bigger and better here. From the monsters (giant octopuses ROCK!) to the sets (loved that cannibal island!) to the villains (Gotta give props to Davey Jones, what a cool villain!) and the comedy. Yup this film had it all and it turned out to be a really entertaining film of epic proportions.The best thing about this movie of course is having Johnny Depp return to one of his best roles. Like I said before, the thing everyone loved the most about the first flick was Depps Jack Sparrow and on this sequel we get plenty of him. Jack is funnier, trickier and in a strange way more lovable then the first since the guy finally learns that sometimes we have to do the right thing. All the supporting characters were great, I loved some of the jokes coming from some of the lesser important pirates. Orlando Bloom was in the movie, but honestly he has very little to do in this one, since most of the film focuses a whole lot more on the chemistry developing between Keira Knightly and Jack Sparrow and the action and effects.Speaking of effects, another great bonus on this film is that the effects are truly spectacular. Getting wowed by effects is getting increasingly difficult for me, but Ill be damned if this one really had me saying wow every five seconds. The gigantic octopus known as the Kraken freaking rocked! Some of the extended effects sequences with the octopus were extremely exciting and incredible to watch. It brought back memories of scenes from 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea and seeing Kirk Douglas battling rubber tentacles. On this film Gore Verbinsky has orchestrated a truly memorable monster sequence. One for the books! And speaking of memorable monsters, I loved Bill Nighy as Davey Jones. Its only fair that since Jack Sparrow is such a memorable anti hero we should also get an equally formidable villain. And such is the case with Davey Jones. Aside from the fact that Mr. Jones has a striking look to him (all about the tentacled beard!) the character itself moves and talks in a very interesting and different manner. Loved the way the bad guys looked in this film! So visually speaking get ready for some cool stuff.Of course the guys behind making this film are very smart. They know how much audiences love Jack Sparrow and they know we want to see more of him which is probably why the movie ends with a cliffhanger ending. They literally leave you gasping for more even though the movie last well more then two hours! So be ready for a Lord of the Rings type of ending where you go WHAT? No way it just ended there! So to me, this was the true spectacle of the summer. Incredible effects, great action, great characters and just plain fun. After all ain't that what summer movies are supposed to be about? Fun big budget special effect spectacles! And this one delivers in spades. So trust me on this one maties, we got ourselves a winner!
