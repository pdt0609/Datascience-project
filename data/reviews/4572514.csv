0,cosmo_tiger,Don't let the fact that you already know what happened dissuade you from watching this. I highly recommend this,8/10,10 April 2017,"""Two people took many days and weeks to plan out hate but love responded in an instant."" Tommy Saunders (Wahlberg) is a Sargent in the BPD. He is assigned to the finish line of the 2013 Boston Marathon. As the race is winding down the unthinkable happens and Tommy is right in the middle of one of the worst terrorist attacks in history. Now, with little evidence or leads Tommy, the FBI and every cop around conduct a manhunt to try and catch those responsible. For some reason I was not really looking forward to watching this. I think one of the reasons may have been the fact that it is still too close to the actual events and I remember watching it unfold on TV so I didn't think this would be that interesting or new. That being said I couldn't have been more wrong. The fact that this story is less than 4 years old really worked for it because it really milked the events prior and it felt tense, then once the bombs went off the pace really picked up and even though you know how it ends you are still tense and on the edge of your seat. I have said many times that there have been movies that are still able to pull off tenseness and excitement even though you know the entire story. This is one of those movies. Don't let the fact that you already know what happened dissuade you from watching this. This is much better than I was expecting and highly recommend this. Overall, tense and exciting. I really really enjoyed this and was engrossed the entire time. I give this an A.",Patriots Day,4572514
1,SnoopyStyle,Hollywood star Mark Wahlberg,7/10,22 February 2018,"Various people's lives cross path in the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing and its following manhunt. It is directed by Peter Berg and starring Boston native Mark Wahlberg.Originally, I feared Mark Wahlberg. He's not the greatest of actors although my bigger fear is that they would make the movie about him. That partly happened. Honestly, I cringed when he started yelling at Kevin Bacon and I rolled my eyes when he showed up to interview the Chinese guy. By placing him in the center of every aspect of the investigation, the movie loses a sense of reality. There is no need for him to be at every aspect of the manhunt. I do love the walk-thru with the security cameras. Otherwise, his role should be cut in half. This shouldn't be a vehicle for Mark.On the other hand, I am overjoyed with the other people's stories. I love the Chinese guy and MIT security guy. This could cut back Wahlberg mugging for the cameras and add work from the other cops. Give me more J.K. Simmons. This movie should not be an one-man story if it purports to show the events in its entirety.",Patriots Day,4572514
2,A_Different_Drummer,Writer/Director Peter Berg Takes Police Work to the next Level,9/10,13 January 2017,"PPs (police procedurals) are a staple of the film/TV industry and are (believe it or not) as common as comedies or romcoms. However, within that category, ""big"" PPs based on big crimes are not that common. In fact, you would have to go back to the early 70s when a number of ""big PPs"" like Day of the Jackal 1973 were all the rage.So, a film like this done properly (and, trust me, this one is done perfectly) would be a treat all by itself. However, what makes this film extra-special is the extensive use of video footage.Now, to be clear, video footage as a plot device is not new by itself. It is now, and has been used extensively in British film and TV because, as we all know, London is the most ""surveyed"" city on the planet.But -- the point -- nothing the Brits have ever done with the forensic use of video comes even close to what Berg brings us in this excellent film. Much the same way that the original creators of CSI-Vegas introduced an entirely new sort of sub-genre, it can be argued that Patriots Day similarly has taken the police procedural to an entirely new level.The film itself? Brilliant! Berg has taken a stellar group of A-listers and make them work as a team, mirroring on the subliminal level the theme of the movie, which is both positive, and hopeful, and suggests that if we all work together, we can accomplish pretty much anything.",Patriots Day,4572514
3,damhnait-75533,A review from someone that was actually there,10/10,26 March 2017,"I was there living in Boston at the time of the bombings. I was in the city to try to get a look at the Marathon finish line. Luckily I didn't get that close. I did see and hear the bombs go off. My God the blood was everywhere I could see that from even where I was standing. It was absolute chaos.This film is incredibly accurate. Mark Wahlberg's character is based on several police officers experiences. There are some trolls on here saying there was a political agenda or the facts are wrong in this film?? They are completely out of their minds. Not even a hint of it. Just the truth of what happened. I know I was there and I LIVED it. Nothing hinting left or right.I had the bad luck of working only a block away from where they captured the last terrorist in Watertown. I was stuck in our office sitting on the floor with State troopers giving us water bottles for like 12 hours. No one complained. The city was in lock down. I shouldn't have even been in work. When the police and FBI captured him people came out of their houses onto the streets clapping and celebrating as the police came by. It was a lovely thing to witness. Rarely do films do it right like ""Patriots Day"" but they some how managed to recreate that same atmosphere. It was an extraordinary time to live in Boston with everyone coming together and this film really depicted that.",Patriots Day,4572514
4,UniqueParticle,Very well done in many ways!,10/10,8 March 2019,"I wanna start by saying I didn't know much about the actual events, I just know I was saddened when I heard about it. I was blown away; it was phenomenally filmed and very intriguing. I'm quite surprised it wasn't up for major awards. I cried a little during the bombing bit and I felt bad for what a lot of people had to go through.There also seemed to be others complaining about things missing; I'm not sure but I think Peter Bergs take on everything is very intense, especially the thrilling bits hunting down the terrorists. I say just appreciate it the way it is or don't and if anything was added I think it was done perfectly.Sorry about the way I describe things I do the best I can I'm a little quirky.

5,bob-the-movie-man,A Marathon Investigation,8/10,18 March 2017,"While there are predictable social media conspiracy theories that the ""whole thing was a hoax"", the two bombs that went off near the finish line of the Boston marathon on April 15th 2013 killed three members of the public and injured more than 250 others. It was a life- changing event for those people and their immediate families, but sadly nothing more than a small footnote in the global story of car bombs and suicide missions that have killed and maimed thousands and thousands of people in war-stricken countries around the world in recent years. It's a point not lost on the scriptwriters of ""Patriot's Day"", the new film by Peter Berg (""Deepwater Horizon""). In an America where press freedom seems to be under increasing threat, the film refreshingly provides room for reflecting the antagonists' views, twisted and barking as they may be, and the film is better for that. Mark Wahlberg (""Deepwater Horizon"", ""Ted"") plays senior Boston homicide cop Tommy Saunders. He's on menial duties after a past indiscretion, but has just one last day stewarding the finish line of the Boston marathon before being allowed off the 'naughty step' by his boss, Commissioner Ed Davis (John Goodson). Saunders is seen off to work by his wife (Michelle Monaghan, Mrs. Hunt from the Mission Impossible films) but his dull day's work is not going to go as planned thanks to the fanatical Tamerlan Tsarnaev (Themo Melikidze) and his compliant but bullied brother Dzhokhar (Alex Wolff). The pair plant the bombs along Boylston Street, wreaking havoc on American soil, and a massive man-hunt ensues that will see other lives impacted irrevocably before it's over.The storytelling is reminiscent of 70's films like ""Airport"" and ""The Towering Inferno"" in introducing us to a wide range of characters at the start of the film, without knowing how they will later be placed into the jigsaw. Examples are Sergeant Jeffrey Pugliese (J.K. Simmons, ""Whiplash"", ""La La Land"") of the Watertown police department who gets unexpectedly drawn into the action when chaos descends on his sleepy Boston neighborhood, and Chinese student Dun Meng (Jimmy O. Yang in a film debut) who has an unbelievable story of first-hand contact with the bombers. Leading the FBI investigation is Richard DesLauriers (the prolific Kevin Bacon). Unfortunately I always muddle up Bacon with Wahlberg (it must be something about the facial features) so it's not helpful having them in the same film! Even though I knew (albeit vaguely) all of the details of the bombing and the subsequent events, the film successfully made me feel tense throughout. Some of the set-piece action sequences – particularly the showdown in Watertown – are particularly well done. Given the number of rounds of ammo let off and the home-made grenades being lobbed, it is astounding that dozens of officers were not killed. The film is highly respectful towards the victims of the atrocity, with one of the most moving moments of the film being a silent vigil over one of the victims by a State Trooper (Billy Donahue).Wahlberg in particular gives a great performance, with his emotional post-traumatic breakdown scene with Monaghan being his best acting performance in years. However, it is Wahlberg's character that is my major problem with the film. Unlike most of the other characters, who are based on their real-life counterparts, Tommy Saunders is a fictional composite of multiple real-life police officers, and his involvement in each and every part of the drama strained credibility to breaking point for me. It would have been far more effective, in my view, to stick nearer to reality and have a range of other cameos step into those roles.There is a tendency (for this British viewer at least) for the film to overreach with its stirring patriotic message in the closing scenes, and there was the predictable trotting out of the 'real life' photos and videos in the finale, albeit that some of these are movingly portrayed. Apart from those reservations, this is a solidly well-made piece of docufiction that is enjoyable throughout.Just a warning to sensitive viewers that there are obviously some scenes of bodily injury included: if grading on as scale where ""Hacksaw Ridge"" is a 10 and ""Saving Private Ryan"" an 8, then ""Patriot's Day"" would rate about a 7.

6,nogodnomasters,Love responded in an instant,10/10,12 August 2017,"This is the story of the Boston Bombing. We are introduced to a number of characters in quick fashion and to Tommy Saunders (Mark Wahlberg) a composite character used a a conduit for story continuity. The bombing occurs 26 minutes into the film and the rest of the film concentrates on locating the evil doers who made gross mistakes. What I found surprising was the initial encounter with the police. It was a lot more horrific than what was covered on the news. The production was able to splice in actual footage.In spite of using a composite character, the film was very accurate and emotional.Guide: F-word (It's Boston). No sex or nudity.",Patriots Day,4572514
7,classicsoncall,"""It's terrorism. We'll take it."" - FBI Agent Richard DesLauriers",8/10,3 October 2018,"The most compelling part of the movie for me was the detective work that narrowed down the investigation to the Tsarnaev Brothers. It all began with an observant technician reviewing film footage of the crowd and noticing that one of the brothers failed to look in the direction of the bomb blast. I don't know how incredible a catch that might have been unless the viewer was trained in forensics and that was one of the things he was looking for. From there on, a minute by minute analysis of the street scene revealed more detail that brought authorities closer to identifying the terrorists. Simply great detective work, and a testament to the fact that anyone else trying something of a similar nature is bound to get tracked down in a likewise manner.The film wisely stayed away from a more graphic depiction of the horror involved, though what was shown was bad enough. Mark Wahlberg as a composite character was fairly effective, though it did seem too coincidental that he was in so many critical points of the investigation to seem credible. Otherwise, in recalling the news coverage of that week in Boston, it appeared that the film makers stayed close to the mark with the day by day manhunt to eventually capture Tamerlan Tsarnaev (Themo Melikidze). The shootout in Watertown seemed a bit exaggerated. but who's to say who wasn't there. Overall, an effective telling of the 2013 Boston Marathon, the bombing that disrupted it, and the aftermath. The montage of real life characters following the story was effective for identifying the survivors and heroes of the event. I notice that being done more and more lately (""Hacksaw Ridge"", ""Sully""), which only furthers the credibility of every day people rising to the occasion when disaster strikes.",Patriots Day,4572514
8,subxerogravity,I was very impressed by what I saw.,7/10,23 December 2016,"Was never fully sure about the movie. Very iffy only because I find it weird how so many movies about real life stories are about relatively recent events. The marathon bomber happen three years ago, that seems like such little time to make a narrative about history.Despite this, it was a great police drama. It showed law enforcement coming together for the greater good and it was a beautiful image to see, cause in most police dramas, cops even have discrimination upon themselves. If this was fiction, Boston PD would not be able to get along with Water Town PD and both would hate the FBI cause for some reason the tension of trying to find terrorist is not enough for writers. It was good to see cops be 100% at their job. They were not portrayed as being perfect only as being human and heroes are human. They were regular Boston citizens who wear a badge.It was a very good story about people coming together to step up to the challenge. I expect noting less from director Peter Berg who has a real skill when it comes to bringing out every heroic moment.",Patriots Day,4572514

10,Semisonic,Would've been better as a documentary,6/10,20 March 2017,"People are captivated by the extraordinary events. And people love to be entertained. So what could possibly be better than a dramatic story of extraordinary nature. Especially if it's based on real events, shows the heroism of simple people and touches the audience's sensitive patriotic spot.That's basically a recipe for Patriots Day. Take the case of the Boston Marathon bombing, the largest terrorist attack in the US since 9/11, show it through the eyes of several regular people, first introducing their personal lives and then following them along the course of the main events. And finally, when it's all over, add some first-person moral lessons and conclusions, so that we all realize for sure how important and pivotal that event was for the people and for the world, and feel privy to its changing momentum.All by itself, it's a pretty good, even noble approach. But there's a tiny little detail that changes everything: that all that must sell somehow, because even the extraordinary stories have to be entertaining. So the otherwise consistent and self-sufficient story is being infused with dramatization, laying it on even thicker where it's already been thick, and creating moments that might not have been there in the first place simply to make the story more of a thriller. A very similar thing happened just recently with Deepwater Horizon.The result becomes a product with the typical Hollywood spin, but proudly called ""based on real events"". That it might be, but on the basis of real people's actions, beliefs and lives there has been put enough creative imagination for the film to feel at times fake, at times cheesy and at times way over the top. And we will never know for sure if some or other moments that touched each of us personally happened for real, or they were skillfully injected by the filmmakers to genetically modify the movie and make it more appealing to the audience. Having fallen for this trick before, I refuse to be bought so cheaply again. So I really wish movies such as Patriots Day were made as documentaries. Yes, maybe they wouldn't sell as much, but at least they would be sincere and true. And what if not truth and sincerity do such stories try to uphold?",Patriots Day,4572514
11,jc-999-591106,Surprisingly Moving,8/10,12 January 2017,"I saw this movie at a preview showing and was very pleasantly surprised. The movie is great, the cast are uniformly excellent, and the plot moves along really nicely. I was mesmerized throughout, the pacing was excellent and, even though we all remember the outcome from the extensive news coverage, I was surprised at some of the things that happened before the end. It was surprisingly moving at a few points, sorry, no spoilers so I won't say any more.Great job to everyone who worked on this movie.

12,Lejink,Off the pace,3/10,27 April 2018,"For a film where the actors were obviously carefully selected for their resemblance to their real-life counterparts, (as is made clear by the introduction of the real participants near the end of the film), to pivot the action around an entirely fictitious character (Mark Wahlberg's ubiquitous police officer], surely had to be a mistake. I say ubiquitous because Wahlberg always seems to be Johnny-on-the-spot whenever anything significant happens in the action. There he is close by when the bombs go off, he's there just after the young Chinese boy is kidnapped and carjacked by the two bombers, he's also there at their shoot out with the cops and again when the authorities finally catch up with the fugitive younger brother. Once you know this (it becomes obvious when there's no real life equivalent introduced for him at the end), you realise you've been manipulated as a viewer and it just weakens the whole premise of the film. Surely there were enough brave citizens and emergency services in Boston on the day of the incident without the need for this imaginary person. Otherwise I couldn't say I was entirely gripped as I think I should have been by the depiction of proceedings as they were presented. Of course the story has to follow the real life sequence of events which I don't doubt it did, I just didn't think it was done in a very exciting or gripping way.Fine to celebrate the everyday heroism of ordinary average people when confronted by the unexpected, criminal and dangerous, but stretching it to a two hour movie didn't come off here.",Patriots Day,4572514
13,ma-cortes,Decent reenacting about the Boston marathon massacre focused on a relentless policeman chasing down the terrorists,7/10,18 April 2023,"The title refers to Patriots' Day, the Massachusetts state holiday on which the Boston Marathon is held. The movie begins on April 14, 2013, a day before the marathon. The next day, brothers Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev detonate two bombs during the Boston Marathon, causing widespread panic . A young couple, Patrick Downes (Christopher O'Shea) and Jessica Kensky (Rachel Brosnahan) , are injured and taken to separate hospitals, where they are both required to have their legs amputated. Steve Woolfenden, a family man, is also injured and separated from his toddler son, Leo, who is taken by the police to a safe location. While a stubborn police cop Tommy Sanders (Mark Walhberg , whose role is a composite of many Boston cops who worked the marathon, and aided in the manhunt following the bombing) -married to Carol Saunders (Michelle Monaghan)- pursues mercilessly the two terrorists. In nearby Watertown, Sergeant Jeffrey Pugliese (JK Simmons) also goes after the asassins. Once things have settled in the area and everyone has been cleared out, the police meet with FBI Special Agent in Charge Rick Deslauriers (Kevin Bacon). The inside story of the world's greatest manhunt !. True heroes !. True strength !. From the director of Lone Survivor and Deepwater Horizon !. Based on true events !.Patriots Day is a 2016 American action drama film about the Boston Marathon bombings in 2013 and the subsequent terrorist manhunt , including a lot of stock footage from the actual events. Nicely directed by Peter Berg and written by Berg, Matt Cook, and Joshua Zetumer, the film is based on the book Boston Strong by Casey Sherman and Dave Wedge. This thrilling and interesting movie deals with the Boston Marathon attack, the film narrates that shocking event through the story of police sergeant Tommy Sanders, a fictitious character inspired by three real police officers who intervened in the persecution carried out throughout the city to hunt down the guilty of the bloody attack, which left three fatalities and more than 260 wounded.Mark Wahlberg produced the film along with Scott Stuber, Dylan Clark, Stephen Levinson, Michael Radutzky, Hutch Parker and Dorothy Aufiero. Principal photography began on March 29, 2016, and was conducted in New York City; Boston; Quincy, Massachusetts; Los Angeles; New Orleans; and Philadelphia , being well photograhed by director of cinematography Tobias A. Schliessler . Academy Award-winning composers and Nine Inch Nails members Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross were hired to write the musical score for the film, composing an adequate and tense soundtrack. The motion picture was competently directed by Peter Berg, it was released in Boston, New York and Los Angeles on December 21, 2016, followed by a nationwide expansion on January 13, 2017. It received positive reviews for Berg's direction and the performances of its cast,and was chosen by the National Board of Review as one of the top ten films of 2016. Well directed by Peter Berg , Patriots day marks the third collaboration between Mark Wahlberg and Peter Berg after the films Deepwater Horizon (2016) and Lone Survivor (2013), all of them based on true events.

14,ferguson-6,spirit,6/10,12 January 2017,"Greetings again from the darkness. Is it too soon? If not, is it too painful to revisit? Even if the time is right, is injecting a fictitious supercop into the horrific events an acceptable approach? Every viewer of the film will have their own answers to these questions, but clearly writer/director Peter Berg (Deepwater Horizon, Lone Survivor) and Boston area native Mark Wahlberg believed now is the time and that this is the best way to re-create this catastrophe and its fallout. Wahlberg plays Tommy Saunders, a Boston detective kicked back to uniform duty as penance for a run-in with another cop. His character is evidently a composite of multiple cops and first responders, and though he is the center of the film, the character is the weak link. He's some type of supercop who never sleeps and manages to be literally everywhere something is happening  either the Boston Marathon finish line, FBI control center, the hospital interviewing survivors, or cruising the streets with his spotlight tracking down the bad guys. Beyond Wahlberg's character, the film does a remarkable job at re-creating the tragic events, the emotional and physical fallout, and the urgent law enforcement manhunt. Since it's been less than 4 years, most every piece of this is fresh in our minds. We follow along from when the street cameras are used to identify the suspects all the way through the final capture from the backyard boat.Another thing the film does well is tell the stories of certain individuals who were impacted. We experience the emotions of Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis (John Goodman), the preparedness and cool of Watertown Police Chief Jeffrey Pugliese (JK Simmons), the highs and lows of MIT Officer Sean Collier (Jake Picking), the terror and courage of captive Dun Meng (Jimmy O Yang), and the focus and conflicts of Governor Deval Patrick (Michael Beach) and FBI Special Agent Richard DesLauriers (Kevin Bacon). There is also the story of survivors Jessica Kensky (Rachel Brosnahan) and Christopher O'Shea (Patrick Downes), and a few others who we get to know a little bit. The bombers/terrorists/brothers are played by Alex Wolff and Themo Melikidze, and no effort is made to sympathize or explain their actions. The closest we get is an argument in the apartment with the wife (played by Melissa Benoist) over the wrong type of milk. I will not use the real names here as I don't believe in providing any publicity for such creators of evil. The film successfully establishes the ""normal"" start to what seemed to be a ""normal"" day. Of course, April 13 2013 turned out to be anything but. We hear the Newtown tribute at the opening of the race, and we see David Ortiz with his color proclamation at Fenway Park. The music by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross is always spot on with the mood, and the last 10 minutes are by far the most emotional  we hear from the real life survivors, first responders and others so crucial to that time. I may believe that this story would best be told in documentary form, but there is no denying that it's a reminder of the power of love, and the spirit of Boston and America.",Patriots Day,4572514
15,bkrauser-81-311064,Reeks of Opportunism,6/10,15 January 2017,"What is this movie trying to say? I ask without a desire to be controversial or contrarian towards the vast ocean of critics and filmgoers who loved this film. I'm aware of the craftsmanship involved in a film like this, I'm aware of the feats it likely took to keep this film tasteful and lord knows that to some, this movie is going to feel like a satisfactory catharsis. In interviews director Peter Berg and Mark Wahlberg have stated the film should be seen as a movie about a city coming together to fight evil. ""The more research I did, the more I realized it really was an example of a community working together"" said Berg. But despite good intentions and diplomatic words (or lip service depending on how close you are to this), at the end of the day I still need to ask myself, what really, is the point here?The main story of Patriots Day needs no retelling. I'm sure a lot of Americans are acutely aware of where they were on April 15, 2013; certainly every Bostonian is. The dramatic arc of the movie and part of what makes the movie so ""tasteful"" is it bends and weaves through the lives of different people intimately involved in the terrorist plot. Such people include Patrick Downes (O'Shea) and Jessica Kensky (Brosnahan), a young couple injured by the first explosion; Officer Sean Collier (Picking), the MIT policeman who was shot and killed in the line of duty; Chinese national Dun Meng (Yang) who was briefly held hostage by the bombers and Sergeant Jeffrey Pugliese (Simmons) who brought down the elder of the Tsarnaev brothers.Then of course there's Mark Wahlberg who plays the very fictional and very chuckle-headed Tommy Saunders (Wahlberg); a Boston cop whose story, I think, is meant to serve as connective tissue. His character provides a very insidious discord; not only because his inclusion in everything from the bombing, to the shootout, to the final arrest is downright serendipitous, but because he pulls focus in order to rationalize vigilante justice. He waxes poetically about moral absolutes, gets in the face of investigative brass, jumps every preordained hoop that gets him closer to the bad guys and still has time to weep over the aftermath of the attack. Come to think of it, Wahlberg's not just connective tissue, he's the whole f***ing box and at some point in the film his mugging just stops becoming forgivable.The other odious element of the film is the inclusion, exploration and exploitation of the Tsarnaev brothers played by Alex Wolff and Themo Melikidze. They are introduced amid a flurry of intros in the first ten minutes - the score bellowing in minor keys as Tamerlan (Melikidze) watches ISIS videos while consuming Cheerios. Now while there's no inherent problem with heavily inferring these guys are, in fact the bad guys, the movie is supposedly intended to be ""about Boston"". So why include these characters at all? What insights can be gained about the grit and determination of Beantown from a pair of sad, pathetic, anti-social wannabe terrorists? Nothing - unless the goal of their inclusion is to exploit our fears and make them something more than a pair of sad, pathetic, anti-social wannabe terrorists.To that end the film does a pretty fine job being a taut, story beat conscious piece of bluster that elevates what was in reality a messy, painstaking investigation into a simplistic fight between good vs. evil. Meanwhile the Tsarnaev clowns and to a lesser extent the elder's wife (Benoist) are all portrayed as the apex of storybook evil. The kind of evil that only loosely wears a human face. It's a tact that despite being easily digestible is immediately complicated when you consider the younger Tsarnaev is awaiting an appeal of his death sentence and the wife (whom the movie heavily implies knew everything), is still around and bracing for a new glut of death threats.It's interesting to note that Patriots Day is the result of two separate scripts combined to make one big compromised movie. And while you can tell great pains were exercised in the service of this film, the end result still feels like a tug-o-war. There's the fictional composite lead and the true-to-life ensemble. There's the genre clichés artlessly retrofitted with the honest human elements. There's the story of hope in the face of terror, shadowed by an agenda that cheapens the whole ordeal. What's truly lost in the smoke, mirrors and Markie Mark chest beating is the actual story of Boston. A story that could have yielded a rich civic mosaic. Instead what we got was a movie that just reeks of opportunism.",Patriots Day,4572514
16,cricketbat,Brought back many of the emotions I felt years ago,8/10,28 December 2018,"Patriots Day brought back many of the emotions I felt when the Boston Marathon bombing happened years ago-shock, anger, frustration, fear, and lastly, hope. This respectful tribute to those who rose above the cowardly terrorists' attacks feels so realistic at times that it's uncomfortable. It's not an easy to move to watch, but it's worth your time.

17,trublu215,"Thrilling, Gut Wrenching, and Absolutely Stunning",10/10,7 December 2016,"Patriots Day is a somber film, one that is soaked in contempt for its depiction and skepticism for its accuracy of the events that transpired on April 15, 2013 at the Boston Marathon and then the subsequent events that followed. Well, I can assure those of you who are feeling negative emotions over this, Peter Berg and Mark Wahlberg have created, not only a great film but a respectable one. There are no ""lone hero"" moments for those of you who see Wahlberg's name in the same sentence as the term Boston Bombing movie and think it will be a balls out action film. Trust me, it is not. It is so far removed from that notion that it made me like the film even more. Despite Wahlberg's character being fictitious, it still holds a great deal of reality to it all.The film starts off with immediately. There is no sort of fluff to this film, it starts off trying to be as realistic as possible and it achieves this ten fold. It starts on the morning of April 15, 2013 as a beautiful day. Throughout the course of the marathon, we're introduced to a plethora of characters ranging from John Goodman's Ed Davis to Kevin Bacon's Richard DesLauris. Once the film is done getting us acclimated to these people...it happens and when it happens, it is horrifying. The explosion is LOUD. There is no lead up to it, it felt like it did in real life, it's a shock. From this moment on, Patriots Day kicks into a high-octane race against time thriller more in the vein of Zero Dark Thirty.The film itself is Peter Berg's masterpiece. It is every bit as thrilling and gut-wrenching as it is heartbreaking yet uplifting simultaneously. There is a clear cut love for this film by its maker and it absolutely pays off. The drama is every bit as riveting as the brutal action sequences (especially the final confrontation). This is Berg at his best. He does an amazing job here with both directing and writing and I don't think it will go unnoticed. The score is the other half to this film. Atticus Ross and Trent Reznor do amazing work here in this and it was really cool to see a film that suited their talents as well as this film did.The acting is absolutely excellent. Mark Wahlberg gives his absolute all in this role. The rage he feels in frame is real, the tears he cries in frame are real and the anger he feels in this is most certainly real. I think it might just be his best performance. J.K. Simmons is another phenomenal actor in this film that gives a perfect performance as Jeffrey Pugliese. To sum it up as best I can, the acting is top-notch and I'd be very surprised if the film didn't garner a couple acting nominations at this point but only time can tell.Overall, Patriots Day is every bit as thrilling as its true story. It will have you crying, gasping for air, gripping your arm rest and sometimes all at once. Peter Berg delivers an excellent film with Mark Wahlberg giving the most honest performance of his career. I highly recommend it.",Patriots Day,4572514
18,dave-mcclain,"""Patriots Day"" is very well acted by its talented cast, perfectly paced and has its focus in the right place.",8/10,17 January 2017,"The word ""patriot"", according to dictionary.com, means ""a person who loves, supports, and defends his or her country and its interests with devotion"". That's what a small group of armed militia known as ""minutemen"" did near Boston, Massachusetts on April 19, 1775, when they fired on British troops, beginning the American Revolutionary War. The New England states of Massachusetts and Maine (which, until 1820, was part of Massachusetts), commemorate the anniversary of that day as an official state holiday, since 1969, celebrating it on the third Monday in April. According to Wikipedia.com, ""The biggest celebration of Patriots' Day is the Boston Marathon, which has been run every Patriots' Day since April 19, 1897 to mark the then-recently established holiday."" The local and national pride exhibited on Patriots' Day took on new meaning after being attacked at the Boston Marathon on April 15, 2013, an event depicted in the 2016 historical drama/thriller ""Patriots Day"" (R, 2:13).The film focuses on the people personally affected by the bombing. Tommy Saunders (Mark Wahlberg) is a dedicated Sergeant in the Boston Police Department and has a devoted wife (Michelle Monaghan) who works as an RN. Tommy is friendly with Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis (John Goodman) and both end up working closely on the bombing investigation with Boston Police Superintendent William Evans (James Colby), FBI Special Agent Richard DesLauriers (Kevin Bacon), Boston Mayor Thomas Menino (Vincent Curatola) and Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick (Michael Beach). But before we get to that point, we meet Watertown police officer Jeffrey Pugliese (J. K. Simmons), Chinese immigrant Dun Meng (Jimmy O. Yang) who is bragging on the phone to his parents about his new SUV, MIT police officer Sean Collier (Jake Picking) who is making plans with some grad students to go to a concert, married couple Patrick Downes and Jessica Kensky (Christopher O'Shea and Rachel Brosnahan) who are discussing their plans for the day, and Boston residents and radical Islamists Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev (Alex Wolfe and Themo Melikidze) who are making a plan which will disrupt the lives of all of those people, a plan which Tamerlan's wife (Melissa Benoist) may or may not know about beforehand.Early on Marathon Monday, Commissioner Davis is near the race's finish line and greets Sergeant Saunders, who is simply working security due to an injured knee. Saunders calls his wife to ask her to bring him his bigger knee brace, while Downes and Kensky prepare to join hundreds of thousands of others to watch the marathon. The race goes off without a hitch, until a group of runners are about to cross the finish line and a bomb goes off, followed by another less than 15 seconds later. As frightened bystanders flee and the injured and dead lie on the ground, the Boston police jump into action. Soon, Special Agent DesLauriers arrives on the scene and declares the explosions an act of terrorism. He sets up a large command center in an empty warehouse where agents pour over photos and videos from the scene, desperate to find whoever is responsible for the bombing. After identifying two ball cap wearing persons of interest, which they initially refer to as ""black hat"" and ""white hat"", the investigators argue over whether to release the images to the public. Meanwhile, the Tsarnaev brothers are lying low at home, but soon decide to get moving again and begin planning another bombing. Then the brothers run into local police in Watertown – on April 19th, the exact anniversary of that day in 1775 when the citizens of Massachusetts confronted foreigners whom they accused of terrorist acts.""Patriots Day"" is very well acted by its talented cast and perfectly paced by director Peter Berg (in the midst of his third collaboration with Wahlberg – after 2013's ""Lone Survivor"" and 2016's ""Deepwater Horizon""), but this movie's main strength is its script by Berg, Matt Cook and Joshua Zeturner. Terrorism is ultimately about the people involved – the perpetrators and their victims – and this film does a great job of personalizing its story and humanizing those affected. ""Patriots Day"" keeps a broad scope (combining the concepts for two proposed movies about the bombing and its aftermath, including one based on the 2015 book ""Boston Strong: A City's Triumph Over Tragedy"") which gives its audience a good overview of what happened, but tells the story from ground level, through the eyes of its main characters. However, we get little insight into the lives of the Tsarnaev brothers and what motivated them, but that's not what this movie is about. ""Patriots Day"" mainly concerns itself with the effect the bombing had on its victims and the exceptional spirit, strength and resilience of the City of Boston. From that perspective, the film works well as history lesson, police procedural and mostly, human drama. ""A-""",Patriots Day,4572514
19,phd_travel,Thorough depiction of the main events,10/10,11 January 2017,"The events of the Boston Marathon deserved a caring and thorough portrayal on screen and this movie delivers in many praiseworthy ways.The bombing itself is shown but not too graphically. It's respectful to the dignity of the victims. The fatalities are acknowledged at the end of the movie but not portrayed by actors in the movie.The victims. The tragic MIT campus police who was killed and the brave young couple who lost legs are shown. It's so heartbreaking when the camera shows their legs before knowing what is going to happen. There must be some reason why they didn't show more about other individual victims before and after the bombing. Highly recommend watching the HBO documentary about the victims to see their ordeal which would have been difficult to cover in the length of this feature film.The pursuit and capture. The pursuit and capture is masterfully shown. Big emphasis that it was a joint effort between the public and the law enforcement. Kudos to this movie for giving full credit to the Chinese grad student who was car jacked, ran away and identified the bombers to police. Without his bravery the two could have gone on to NYC. The almost stranger than fiction shoot out in the street and capture in the boat and the overwhelmed cops is terrifyingly and searingly portrayed. Well done Peter Berg for showing this in well filmed detail including the identification process from cameras. There is one fault in the movie. There could have been a bit less about law individual enforcement personnel mainly Mark Wahlberg's character and his injured knee kicking down the door which seems so trivial compared to the events. I understand for narrative purposes they needed a central character to focus on, but his pov wasn't the best one to show.The perpetrator's point of view. Tsarnaev brothers are acted by actors who look quite a lot like them - pretty terrifying. Their actions are shown in detail although not the background motivations. Even the misguided classmates who helped shield the younger brother are shown. One of the most chilling scenes is the interview with Katherine Russell, wife of the elder brother. An unrecognizable Melissa Benoist of Supergirl bravely takes on this role. This movie wasn't released before the elections so it can't be called a political movie like 13 Hours. But hopefully people everyone whether left or right will just focus on the victims of the bombing and law enforcement.",Patriots Day,4572514
20,meeza,On track as one of the best of 2016!,10/10,13 July 2017,"I am going to run this by you from the start, Director Peter Berg has masterminded an excellent procedural film in ""Patriots Day""; which is not based on dates that the New England Patriots have won Super Bowls in the last 20 years. Seriously, it is based on the bombing that occurred in the Boston Marathon in 2013 which suffered some fatalities and many injuries. We all do know the happenings from that day and after, but Berg executes the direction of ""Patriots Day"" in such a multi-layered precise fashion that makes viewers be infused within the tragedies & triumphs of this unforgettable occurrence. Berg favorite Mark Wahlberg stars as Boston PD Sergeant Tommy Saunders; why wasn't he a Colonel? Sorry, my mind is a bit Kentucky Pun Fried. Anyways, Wahlber's Saunders is a representation of a Boston Police official who was both involved in the marathon bombing and the capture of one of the suspects. Berg alongside co-writers Matt Cook and Joshua Zetumer developed a multifaceted screenplay that incorporates many figures and happenings which occurred before and during the bombing; and also the days following during the hunt of the brother suspects. The film is not an actor's showcase it is more Berg's run; but we do get admirable performances from Wahlberg, John Goodman, Kevin Bacon, and J.K. Simmons; also notable were the performances from Alex Wolff and Themo Melikidze who play the terrorist brothers Dzohkhar and Tamerian Tsarnaev. I have to consider myself a cinematic patriot by lining up ""Patriots Day"" as one of the most gripping films of 2016. ***** Excellent",Patriots Day,4572514
21,nfirthpanetta,Good Film but Lacks Depth,7/10,18 March 2017,"There seem to be a lot of negative reviews for this movie because of an apparent mis-telling of the story or true story or hoax or whatever else people have said. As I'm not American, and have very little to do with American events (so hence have no context as to the truth or hoax or conspiracy or whatever of the Boston Marathon) I shall just stick to reviewing the movie for what it is: a movie.As a movie, they did a great job pulling it together. Mark Wahlberg plays his character perfectly. I have no idea if thats because of his acting ability, or if its more the fact that someone has yet again created a character that fits Mark Wahlberg to perfection. To be honest, it's probably the latter. Because of that, if you liked Deep Water Horizon then you'll probably like this because his acting is the same in both (which works fine because it's similar type of emotion and adrenaline you'd expect from both situations).The character spread was also well done. You got to see the impacting/impacted characters early on and had a nice transition between their development as the movie progressed.My only reservation about the film is that it pretty much gives you no explanation as to why the bombing even happened. Sure, it's easy for people to shout that it was terrorism or a hate crime, or done by hateful people, but that isn't an explanation. It might be true, but it's not an explanation, it's blatant ignorance which the world can no longer afford. This film could have benefited so much from shedding some light on the bombers motivation!!! To be honest, they were actually the one part that let this film down, Their storyline was wasted on surface level personality development and retracing of their steps throughout the event. Instead, the film should have used that time to instead show their motivation to commit the acts. This would have deepened their storyline and given the movie as a whole, a much richer and more stimulating story. In saying that, Themo Melikidze did a great job of making a believable character out of the little depth he was given.All in all this was a good film, however, it does lack the depth and backbone necessary for a second viewing.",Patriots Day,4572514
22,fenix-24981,Great film,10/10,27 March 2017,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie as one of Bostonians. This movie does not have over-the-top action sequences or over-acting. It just tells story as it happened and I really liked that. Yes, there are some non-existing characters and elements, but I think those make movie progression little smoother.I highly recommend this movie.

23,Prismark10,Patriots Day,6/10,23 June 2019,"Peter Berg brings an account of the Boston Marathon bombing of 2013. Three people died over 200 were injured as two bombs went off near the finish line. Bombs placed by the Tsarnaev brothers who were of Chechen origin.Once the bombs go off, Patriots Day becomes a procedural thriller. It focuses on the down on his luck with a bad leg, fictional hero Sergeant Tommy Saunders (Mark Wahlberg.)As the film progresses the most interesting and intriguing character is Special Agent Richard DesLauriers (Kevin Bacon) the FBI agent in charge of the investigation. Berg deserves credit for having a nuanced portrayal of the FBI in this film. It is just a shame that DesLauriers is relegated to the background. It would had been a different film with him as the lead but a better one.Some of the characters appear who seemed to be unrelated to the movie's narrative until much later on. An example is the Chinese student Dun Meng who has a frightening encounter with the brothers late at night or Sergeant Jeffrey Pugliese (J K Simmons) the cop in Watertown.The film is uncertain about its treatment of the Tsarnaev brothers. Were they hardened criminals, committed terrorists or just two idiots who could not even get the right type of milk for a baby? At times the brothers appeared to be dim, glad that they were driving a Mercedes.The heroes of Patriot's Day are the people of Boston and the victims. However there is something both glib and empty about this movie using a real life tragedy for a commercial thriller so soon after the events.",Patriots Day,4572514
24,mhorg2018,"It was OK, and too many reviewers are hysterical.",4/10,23 March 2018,"So some reviewers found this Islamaphobic and Anti-Islam. Are you aware that the two bombers were Islamic? So that eliminates your silly argument. As for the movie itself, it was just OK. I find Wahlberg barely tolerable at best, and the rest of the cast just seemed to wander around. The hunting of the terrorists was done decently, but overall, if I never see this again, I'd be ok with that.

25,mahmus,Really good,8/10,20 May 2020,"Similar to Peter Berg's previous film ""Deepwater Horizon"", this movie takes a real life tragedy and makes an exciting and entertaining drama that pays respect to the victims and never feels like it's turning the it into a dumb Hollywood action movie.It's harrowing and really well directed and acted. I was particularly surprised by the rather nuanced portrayal of the two bombers.Like Deepwater Horizon, I feel that the closing montage of the real people involved goes for a bit too long.Also, the first act and part of the second act are full of seemingly unrelated subplots and characters. Of course it all comes together in the end, but it's a bit distracting on a first viewing.I have other problems with the film (Mark Whalberg gives a very corny speech at one point), but they don't really affect my enjoyment of it.",Patriots Day,4572514

Another film that was also based on this was Stronger which starred Jake Gyllenhaal.",Patriots Day,4572514
27,kgprophet,Tolerance is Patriotic,6/10,29 March 2017,"What does it say about this film that went from possible Oscar contender to box office flop? Or perhaps, the question is, what does it say about us? I did not have any interest to see ""World Trade Center"" when it was released. To a degree, I felt this was making money off of tragedy. Maybe too soon after the event. I also didn't care to have the entertainment options now being guided by terrorists. We can certainly expect after a high profile tragedy; the special news show, the books, and then the movie. I was open to checking this film out because I was willing to see the director's depiction of the Deepwater Horizon disaster. That film made for an all-out thriller action flick, but yet was able to stay within the boundaries of realism. Now after seeing Patriot's Day, I think director Peter Berg might be trying to imitate Michael Bay with a thousand camera angles and slick editing. It also tries to be a little too convenient by giving our leading man a chance to yuck things up while being at the right place at the right time to save the day. Then there is a strange scene where Mark Wahlberg suddenly becomes psychic and knows which shops the terror suspect walked into. Wahlberg is conveniently placed in the middle of all the major events that were part of this incident. This is done for convenience, but that ultimately does disservice to the factual basis of the story. I did enjoy the energetic pace of the story, both in the build-up and manhunt afterward. Little time is spent setting up the two brothers who instigated the bombing, other than older brother was the more radicalised of the two. Was Wahlberg's character either an amalgam of other characters or just good ole' ""say hi to your ma"" Marky Mark? Either way, his inclusion in this whole incident was like Kevin Costner becoming the main character during the Cuban Missile Crisis (according to ""Thirteen Days""). As for the supporting characters, they don't ever get to say much. Too bad John Goodman's Boston accent is atrocious. Kevin Bacon fits well into his role. Screen time is given to the victims, including before the incident. These scenes thankfully are not used for foreshadowing, and actually do a good job of humanising them. The theme of this movie is camaraderie. There is only a little bickering about the direction of the investigation, and in the process portrays the City of Boston as a fist- pumping patriotic love fest. I felt the manipulative music was deliberately used to push the sentimentality. There is an epilogue that runs too long that tries too hard to squeeze tears out of the audience. I think there could have been a more documentary approach to this sequence, and not use the music as a shameless attempt to push our buttons. This film received very favourable reviews, and perhaps some critics felt trapped in recommending it because of the sensitive nature of the film. Giving this movie a negative review could be seen as a slight on the victims, etc. I compare this movie to the excellent ""United 93"", which chose to use no music, and did not have a fictional charismatic lead guy be the narrative thread. ""United 93"" chose realism over sentimentality and still was a riveting human drama. I must say I agree with the extra message at the end of the film that WE ARE STILL A NATION OF TOLERANCE, and was the responsible thing for the filmmakers to make sure those who watch understand the importance of that message in our current political climate. I ultimately decided to wait until the DVD came out. The longer running time and mixing of fiction with fact in the narrative was tolerable, but also made me not regret seeing it sooner. I believe this film will stand the test of time, so it's worth a look.",Patriots Day,4572514
28,sddavis63,Nothing Here Really Connected With Me,3/10,27 December 2017,"I want to start out with the positive. Patriots Day was a good reminder to me of what actually happened on that day in Boston. Not being an American, I was certainly aware that the bombing of the Boston Marathon had taken place in 2013 but I can't really say that many of the details of the event and its aftermath had stayed with me, in the way that the 9/11 attacks did. So I had honestly forgotten that the hunt for the bombers extended over several days. I didn't remember the police officer who was ambushed by the bomber several days later. I really didn't remember the almost complete lockdown of parts of the city as the authorities closed in on the bombers. So the film was successful in jogging my memory of the events. The testimonies from actual survivors and from others involved in what happened as the movie came to an end were worthwhile, and the tribute to those who were killed (including a 9 year old boy) were sobering. The chaos portrayed in the immediate aftermath of the bombing came across as realistic. So there were some things that worked here - but the basic problem I had with this was that I just didn't find it especially interesting.In all honesty the first 20-30 minutes of this were painfully dull and had me wondering why I was even bothering to watch this. But beyond that, the primary problem I had was that none of the characters really connected with me at all. The movie kind of moved in a bit of a blur. No one stood out and said to me ""I'm the one you need to be watching; I'm the one you need to care about."" None of the victims were really followed that closely. We saw a lot of police work going on - but none of the police officers or other officials made a huge impact. Mark Wahlberg's Sgt. Tommy Saunders was supposed to be doing that. He was the main character. The problem was just that, though - he was a character; completely fictional. I'll give the benefit of saying that the character was a composite, but still fictional. So why did I need to know about his wife, or whatever discipline it was he was dealing with as the movie opened? That was totally superfluous - since the guy didn't even exist! And none of the other actors in this really leaped out at me. As the story moved into the hunt for the bombers, there were times when this came across more as an action thriller for entertainment purposes than anything, full of gunfights and little else. I also can't say that I found this especially dramatic. You wait expectantly for the bombs to go off once the movie shifts to the actual Marathon, but aside from that this comes across as kind of flat. There was also no real exploration of the motive of the Tsarnaev brothers, or how they came to the point of wanting to do this.It's a movie that was going to be made. To be honest, it's probably a movie that needed to be made. There were people who deserved to be paid tribute to, and really the entire city should be commended for the way it came together. Those who made this simply needed to do a better job of connecting with the viewer. (3/10)",Patriots Day,4572514

The writers and editing team have made it easy for us to follow the story and characters with specific time and names of the real people which helps a lot, it flows together nicely.

The action sequences in the last part of the movie was raw, gritty and overall entertaining to watch thanks to how it was shot.The ensemble cast is filled with known and recognizable actors and everyone did a great job, nothing was award worthy but it was still great performances, truly capturing the emotion and feelings of the horrible events.

33,heisenberg12,"A Mixed Bag- Entertaining and Compelling, but Disappoints Overall",6/10,14 January 2017,"This movie comes out at awards season as an apparent surprise contender for the Oscars. It certainly had the source material and some substance to work with. So I went in hoping to be a believer. This is a movie that gets mixed reviews: it's both good and bad.The good is the fine direction and staging of the events that occurred. They were done with keen attention to detail and impressive accuracy to how the events transpired. Therefore, it makes for an effective action movie and thriller. The first hour of the movie is very good; one of the best first halves of any movie I've witnessed this year. It also does an effective job holding your attention, building suspense, and feeling for the unfortunate victims of the tragedy and carnage that occurred. But the film falls short of greatness and even short of being anything special for the genre, a genre that most recently includes much better films like Zero Dark Thirty. These are basically recent manhunt movies for terrorists in events that only took place within three to five years ago before their release. Other examples are United 93 and to some extent, World Trade Center. So don't go in expecting a masterpiece or anything mind blowing. However, it is a decent movie. It does many things right but also many wrong. While it was nice to acknowledge the pride for the Boston PD and LE heroes involved in succeeding in solving the case, that alone isn't enough to make a movie great, obviously due to technicalities and all the other filmmaking aspects. Wahlberg, while a likable guy trying his best, sort of was a distraction and not well cast as an imaginary Boston cop who was there that day and helped investigate the case. He's ""okay"" in the role, but a better character actor wouldn't have been as much of a distraction and probably more believable. Then there's the long drawn out real life interviews at the end. There's a few movies with these this year, but they only show a handful of real life clips or summaries of ""what happened to..."". This one has several minutes of real life interviews and interviewees, from survivors to police officers to politicians and others involved, and it's just all over the place. It came off as amateur overall even though it was nice to hear from the survivors. It was just way too long and awkward for a feature film. Last but not least, while realism was one of the film's biggest strengths as far as how events happened and their staging, including accurate depictions and casting for the Tsarnaev brothers and streets of Watertown the final showdown took place, I was hoping that if they went as far as to create a fictitious character in Wahlberg that they also might be bold and daring enough to tie in an alternative ending for Tamerlan; on the night it happened, live news video showed a naked handcuffed young man being escorted by LE and the reporter claimed that was the suspect and he was in custody (you can even look it up on YouTube- it looks identical to him), and an outside observer can put 2 and 2 together and at least picture and theorize that the PD killed him. Instead, they went with the recorded story that Dzokhar, his brother, ran him over. Of course it would have been controversial and might have led to possible backlash from many arenas, but that would have been compelling. Like I said, if they're going to make up a main character, why not add a surprise twist that may have very well happened according to video footage of the news to people who watched that night. Instead, it came off just a tad predictable. Overall, though, it was a pretty good movie.6/10",Patriots Day,4572514
34,Ramascreen,"Vigorous, powerful, and deeply moving",10/10,20 December 2016,"#PatriotsDayMovie is a perfectly accurate depiction of one of the most harrowing and courageous weeks in U.S. history. Everybody involved in this movie has done the true story and the survivors justice, they approach it with immense respect so much so that the result is a vigorous, powerful, and deeply moving film that's part procedural part thriller with all around great performances.Scripted by Peter Berg, Matt Cook and Joshua Zetumer, directed by Peter Berg, the story focuses on the Boston marathon bombing attack in spring 2013 and the aftermath of that unspeakable tragedy. Mark Wahlberg plays police sergeant Tommy Saunders who joins the first responders and investigators in a race against the clock to hunt down the people responsible. Kevin Bacon plays special agent Richard Deslauriers, John Goodman plays commissioner Ed Davis, J.K. Simmons plays Sergeant Jeffrey Pugliese, and Michelle Monaghan plays nurse Carol Saunders. The film also celebrates community's courage in the face of adversity.There are many aspects that I'm sure Peter Berg had to take into consideration in the process of making this film, there are several fine lines, questions of how to make this sensitive towards the families of the victims, how to make sure that the film doesn't come across as just being action, and how to make sure they tell the story in way that emphasizes what tragedies like this often does which is bring people together. And so I think PATRIOTS DAY is a testament to Peter Berg's strength as a storyteller. The whole thing is staged in such way that immediately takes us back to how it happened three years ago, no sugarcoating, no dumbing down, it even amplifies that unfiltered Boston attitude to the degree which I haven't seen before in any other film, and the addition that they do have, in the case of Mark Wahlberg's character, is there as the voice that conveys the film's message, what it exemplifies.The film at times goes into investigative mode, so it gets riveting, which I think is important because the collaboration and the conflict and the banter between law enforcement agencies did play an integral role on how the event ultimately concluded. Kudos to all the actors involved, especially Themo Melikidze and Alex Wolff who have the heavy burden of portraying the murderers. Themo and Alex essentially become the Tsarnaev brothers and they manage to evoke all kinds emotions in the audience anytime they show up on the screen. I think it's a wise decision on Berg's part to incorporate raw footage from the many of the video surveillance cameras because they only add to the narrative's intensity. ""Patriots Day"" is not a re-enactment, it's a depiction with an ever present theme of what we as human beings or citizens can accomplish if we would just set our differences aside and help one another.",Patriots Day,4572514
35,robertemerald,Powerful true life re-enactment,10/10,1 September 2019,"After seeing this movie I had to marvel had how hard the movie makers must have worked to get all the myriad details correct, honestly, its mind-blowing, and return with a totally powerhouse construction. It's just such an honest and brilliant dedication. In the movie Mark Wahlberg states that terrorism can't win because people will fight it with love, or words to that effect. Very true Mark, but may I sincerely add that terrorists won't win because Hollywood will fight them with powerful movies such as Patriots Day. I thought the casting was really clever. There are some top shelf actors here giving real integrity to the action. The two boys concerned, as well as their victims, were also played with heart. Hats off to the Director, the writers, the camera guys, production members, and all involved. Brilliant realism at its best.

36,ironhorse_iv,"While, it was good movie, Patriot Day was a marathon of emotions to get through.",8/10,21 January 2017,"Maybe, it's just me, but I thought this movie was a little too soon to make. After all, as of this writing, the tragic events of the 2013's Boston Marathon Bombing was only 3 years ago. Because of this, the wounds are far from healed. Don't get me wrong, I know the filmmakers, including director Peter Berg, reportedly took great pains to get the blessing of the Boston community and survivors of the attack in the making of the film. Yet, I really don't like the idea of Hollywood profiting off a tragedy, unless they intend to give the money to charities. Sadly, I don't think, that is the case. As of this writing, there is little prove that the producers has donate any money, made off from this film to the One Fund Boston. I guess, audience members like myself are to blame. After all, we're the ones, paying to see, big time studios reenactments tragic events of real-life people dying on the big screen, knowing full well, that they capitalize on real-people's deaths. I take full responsibility for having a morbid curiosity. It really hard to say 'no'. Movies like this, has always invokes an accompanying social catharsis with people. Some see these types of movies to get reflective and feel grateful for how lucky, their lives are better than those of the characters on screen. Others, go see movies like this, to feel pity and empathy for those who lose their lives, wanting to share in the pain of a tragic event. Yet, for others like myself, went to see this film, wanting to compare the reel-life account to real-life history. Without spoiling the movie based off, 'Boston Strong' by Casey Sherman & Dave Wedge, too much, the film does depicted the bombing and the aftermath, very well. It's visceral and terrifying as you'd expect with Berg mixing gory and gruesome fictional dramatized footage with real-life video footage from the actual event. However, there were a few big jarring moments that were a little too noticeable. A good example is how the film portray the brothers bombers, Dzhokhar (Alex Wolff) and Tamerlan Tsarnaev (Themo Melikidze) staying with each other in Tamerlan's house, after the bombing, when in truth, one of them, Dzhokhar return to university that he was staying and remained there until the FBI released pictures of them at the marathon. Another is how they handle officer, Sean Collier (Jake Picking). Not only did they portray him, as having a relationship with a fictional MIT student, despite in real-life, having a girlfriend, but they also stress that he was just patrolling the school, only to be surprise by the brothers, for reasons, like just wanting a second gun. In truth, Collier was responding to a report of a disturbance of two men, sneaking into the school, when he was ambush. As you see, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology was an attended attack for the brothers, as the terrorists hope to use the school for mass-murder, similar to 2004's Beslan school siege. However, since the brothers were unable to gain access into the school, without being notice. They abandoned their plans for something else. Another thing that bug me about this film is how they paint law enforcement, a little too infallible due to cathartic duties of appealing to the conservative target audience. Not a lot of them, question, the civil liberties that they were tramping on for the greater good. I wish, the film was more interested in questioning those, as it could have been a much richer experience. Because of this, the film does feel a bit manipulative and one-sided. A good example of this, is the scene where Tamerlan's American wife Katherine Russell (Melissa Benoist) is portray as an evil Muslim villain, when in truth, information is still pending, whether Russell had a hand to play or not. There was no good reason, why she wasn't being read her Miranda rights. Another big deviation from true events is the presence of fictional police officer, Tommy Saunders (Mark Wahlberg). While, there is nothing wrong with having a composite character, in the movie. I really don't like, how he is the main driving force for the narrative. The idea, that his super cop character was everywhere and gave ideas on, where the bombers were, was a bit highly unrealistic and felt a bit glamorized. Because of this, I felt like the movie gave little to no credit to the many of the unnamed police officers that put themselves on the line to defend Boston during those importance days. A good example is how Police Officer Dennis 'DJ' Simmonds is not mention in the movie. He gave his life in order to bring the bombers to justice. Plus, the movie doesn't give any credit to victims like Jeff Bauman, who gave a detailed description of the bomber which enabled the photo to be identified and circulated quickly by the FBI. If anything, these people deserve more credit than Wahlberg's fictional character. Still, if you can look past that, Wahlberg does do a great job, showing a range of emotions. His sobbing exposition to his fictional wife, Carol (Michelle Monaghan) was one of the best moments in the film. Still, Wahlberg should had known better, than to, overshadow the other performers in the film. Because of this, I really didn't get the sense, that anybody else, was amazing in the film. It's sad, because rest of the ensemble is mostly based on real people. They were just meh. Even the music from composers, Trent Reznor and Attitcus Ross felt like a letdown. In the end, while, this is the third real-life historical movie collaboration between Wahlberg and Berg since 2013's 'Lone Survivor' and 2016's 'Deepwater Horizon'. I felt that, it is the weakest of the three. It was just watchable. Perhaps, I just like the documentary-style approach to this material toward the end credit better. I can only hope, similar film, 2017's 'Stronger', could be better.",Patriots Day,4572514
37,DanLawson146,Too important for its own good at times,7/10,9 May 2020,"POSITIVES:1) Wahlberg gives a career best performance in this film
2) Every scene with Wahlberg, Goodman and Bacon is excellent
3) The bombing scene and the action scenes are shot very gritty and realistic which is what a film like this needsNEGATIVES:1) It essentially has one large negative and that is that it's trying so hard to be important and impactful that it makes the film worse. Firstly, it's too long. There's no need for it to take half an hour before the bomb actually goes off. There are also too many unimportant characters. This links into the length but also with the importance of the film. There is too much time spent needlessly away from Bacon, Goodman and Wahlberg to follow characters that aren't that important. It seems that the only reason they featured these pointless characters so prominently was so that they could show the footage of the real life people at the end. For example, getting JK Simmons to play a superintendent that is only semi-important in one scene just so the real life superintendent could come on at the end. This is present throughout the film and hurts it a lot. This film should only be 90 minutes long and the extra 45 minutes is pointless padding out of pointless characters",Patriots Day,4572514

39,ThomasDrufke,Boston Strong,9/10,20 January 2017,"Peter Berg is on fire. After putting out Deepwater Horizon a few months back, he's back directing Mark Wahlberg in another film based on a true story. This time, a film based on the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings. Easily one of the most emotionally powerful films of 2016.Patriots Day feels a lot like a documentary. Berg tackles the events leading up to and the aftermath of the attack with great detail. Because of the realism in which Berg displays the attacks, I found myself emotionally overwhelmed more than once within the first half an hour. We are shown a few dozen characters (almost all based on real- life people) across the entire city of Boston, and each of them feel important, unique, and most of all, real. Aside from Wahlberg's fictional character who occasionally gets involved a little too heavily in the search for the bombers, each character feels like a real human being that is experiencing these horrific events. To me, that is the most impressive feat Patriots Day accomplished.Whether it's a police sergeant buying his wife a muffin before heading to work, an MIT officer asking a girl out to a Zac Brown Band concert, or a young couple arguing about how to correctly pronounce certain words in the 'Boston way', this film was filled with real people. These nuances gave the audiences an easier 'in' to the story and characters than I could have imagined. Having a film focusing on this many people is an extremely difficult task, and Berg did a nice job encapsulating all sides of the story.With that said, I think all of the different angles catches up with the film after a while. I was always invested in the story, but I can see where audiences may think the movie wanders. I myself, appreciate how much this film covers, but the fact that it actually takes the time to focus on the bombers could turn some people off. I would have a hard time ever trying to understand the reasoning behind these attacks, but Berg did at least make the terrorists more than just someone with a trigger. You got to see their own real-life problems at home and with each other. Even though I can't help but think terrible thoughts when I see them on screen, I like that there is at least a small arc to them.Patriots Day has a lot going on, and even though it may appear to be counterproductive to show this many sides, it proved to be beneficial for me to see all these different sides to Boston. I felt like these actors weren't really acting, and instead were real people fighting to survive in a time where surviving was all that really mattered. Just as I said with Sully in 2016, Patriots Day is a tribute to how well we work as a species when we work together. The power of the human spirit is not to be trifled with.+Performance of the ensemble+Emotionally heartbreaking about 20 different times+Covers so much ground9.0/10",Patriots Day,4572514
40,imdb-21226,People are reacting to the theme not the quality of the movie,3/10,17 April 2017,"People who are giving this movie a higher rating are most likely reacting to the theme of the movie and not being objective about the film itself. I rented the flick, without knowing anything about the film or who directed it. I knew of the story of course, but the cast was good, and it looked interesting so I rented it. My opinion was cast blindly and honestly. I only looked up the film later to see the details.The movie plays exactly like a made-for-TV movie. It follows the formula to a tee. Peter Berg has done a lot of TV work so it makes sense. Virtually the whole movie was done with hand-held cameras which ensures a jittery constantly moving picture with the exception of the countless aerial shots of Boston. That's really lazy.. The music is a perfect blueprint for the music that is played on TV documentary to unnecessarily boost drama. Again Berg has done a lot of documentaries, so again it makes sense. There is one preachy scene with Wahlberg on the tailgate of a truck that actually made me roll my eyes.. I thought really? Can it be more contrived? John Goodman's character didn't really have anything to do.. J.K. Simmons character is aloof and mostly uninterested and has one of the more ridiculous scenes in the movie. Michelle Monaghan really didn't have a part either. The performances were good, and I love these actors. But there is some big talent wasted on parts that anyone could have played and we wouldn't have noticed.The movie pays tribute to law enforcement, but until the end, they are made to look pretty incompetent and at times, witless. I couldn't understand how that characterization was allowed given the purpose of the movie. It was puzzling. The tribute to the actual victims was very nice. I certainly felt for those people.",Patriots Day,4572514
41,thefirmdrummer,Powerful display of human spirit,10/10,24 March 2019,"This movie is a dedication to all those who acted in the face of evil and came together to resist. A testament to the community of Boston, and America as a whole. I'm proud to know this is the country I live in. I was abroad when the attack happened in 2013 so I watched this more to learn than anything. It isn't the most incredible film ever but I think it was really well done. A very real depiction of what happened and all those involved. #BostonStrong

42,Troy_Campbell,An intelligent and thoughtful tribute.,8/10,3 February 2017,"Reliving the horrible events of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing so soon after it transpired is a risky move. A misstep here can make the whole movie reek of profit-making from a tragedy, a misstep there and you have a slavish recreation that offers no entry into the story on a personal level. It was only a few months ago that director Peter Berg and actor Mark Whalberg gave us the wonderful Deepwater Horizon—a true story about an oil rig disaster—but they've managed to back that up with another triumph-against-all-odds real life tale. Berg introduces us to a plethora of characters in the first act that, although initially unrelated, we know will all be linked together under horrendous circumstances, imbuing the entire set-up with a dread that gets under the skin. Yet no amount of being prepared for what is to come makes the gut punch any softer; the chaos and agony of the bombings are depicted with such ferocity that it's a purely visceral experience of the highest order. Not surprisingly the film wanes a little bit once the focus shifts to tracking down the perpetrators, but as we spend a rather large portion of screen time with the terrorists, the hunt becomes a tense cat-and-mouse affair between monsters who'll kill anyone and an entire city out for justice. We view the complete string of events through the eyes of Whalberg's experienced cop SGT Tommy Saunders—a fictional amalgamation of real-life first responders—allowing the mass heartache of a whole population to be condensed into one relatable, likable man. Thankfully Whalberg is in top form; his Tommy is one part an older, wearier version of SGT Dignam (the sharp-tongued hard-nut played by Whalberg in The Departed) and one part American hero. Considering Berg built a reputation as a Michael Bay-esque style-over-substance filmmaker, it would appear a career course-correct has occurred; Patriots Day (and Deepwater Horizon before it) is an intelligent, thoughtful and emotional tribute to the victims and heroes of a truly terrible event.",Patriots Day,4572514
43,siderite,Formulaic.,6/10,24 September 2017,"There are two bad guys and everybody else who is hunting them are nice decent Boston folk, sympathetic to the victims and enraged by the pain the bombers caused. That's the narrative of the film and nothing in it changes it in any way.I felt it was a failure of the film to portray every participant as a human being, while the bombers were just barely sketched and when they were shown, they were vilified in the most basic way. We can't fight these people if we don't even try to understand them a little bit. Granted, little is known about the two bombers, but the film has made a lot of effort to show the lives and friends and loved ones of all the other important characters.Also, I remember the public insanity when the pictures were released and everybody thought their neighbor is a terrorist. They barely touched on that.So there it is: a formulaic good vs bad story, based on a real event, complete with short interviews from the real victims while the credits roll. I didn't expect much and it's exactly what I got.",Patriots Day,4572514
44,nicholaslewiswriter,More Story than You'd Think,8/10,2 May 2019,"Patriot's Day is definitely uneven in its narrative but its brutal intensity, realistic depiction, and suspense is so engrossing you will leave the movie feeling the horror of terrorism and the heroic nature of those who stepped up to help Boston.

45,grantss,Surprisingly good,7/10,1 December 2017,"The events of the Boston Marathon bombing of 2013, mostly seen through the eyes of Boston Police Department's Sergeant Tommy Saunders, plus other people involved, including the perpetrators. We see everything unfold, from the lead up to the marathon, to the bombing, to the manhunt for the killers.Surprisingly good. This is a Peter Berg-Mark Wahlberg collaboration and their previous two movies - Lone Survivor and Deepwater Horizon - were fairly one-dimensional offerings: based on true stories but extensively Hollywoodized with Mark Wahlberg playing the stereotypical, cartoonish hero. I was expecting Patriots Day to go down the same path (the title didn't help!) and in patches it does threaten to turn into a gung ho, chest-beating exercise with a single perfect hero solving all the world's problems.Those patches are whenever Mark Wahlberg is involved. Everything he does in this movie is overwrought, overdone, overacted, cartoonish, speech-filled and irritating. Thankfully, however, Peter Berg doesn't turn it into a one-man show. There's enough scenes without Wahlberg and these are where the movie is very good. The investigation is intriguing and the sequence of events quite interesting and edifying. Some great action scenes.Take Mark Wahlberg out of it and this movie could have been brilliant.",Patriots Day,4572514
46,Hitchcoc,Mostly Well Done,8/10,15 January 2017,"I was hesitant to see this film because most of the events are so fresh in my mind. Fresh is a little overstated because what was going on was broadcast kind of haphazardly in a disrupted time frame. Looking back, I've seen a chronology of the events, but at the time I wasn't sure that, beyond the actual bombing, we were privy to the sequence of events. This movie, for me, did a wonderful job of setting up the events leading to the explosions. I'm not talking about Walberg's mega-character, but the brothers and their plotting. Once all hell breaks loose, there are two focuses. I was pleased that they held back on the carnage. What view we had was enough for a viewer. We all know from the facts that it was even worse than that presented. Next, we have the arrival of the FBI to take over the project. While I accept Walberg's guy as a composite character, I was curious if there were guys in the big warehouse pushing at the Feds. I don't know. Perhaps there were. I was also curious how much Hollywood was involved in Tamerlan's death. I've never heard more than a rudimentary explanation that he was killed in a serious shootout. Was it correctly presented with all the explosions and pyrotechnics? I now I'm sounding a bit nit- picky. I have great admiration for the people who were there (the Godmother of one of my children finished the race earlier). The efforts to catch these guys was Herculean. But how much did they add to an already remarkable story? Oh, and did some survivalist type with a big rifle joint the SWAT team on the roof for the final capture. She is an unknown with a rifle. Really? I thought that was such a lame effort at humor in an incredibly tense situation. Still, I would recommend this film for it's portrayal of a dark time in our history.",Patriots Day,4572514

69% on Metacritic.
88% of google users liked this movie.I randomly saw this movie on Netflix on 5th of July.This movie glorifies police officers as HEROES and completely disregards the MEDICAL HEROES that helped the injured and saved lives (e.g. doctors & nurses).I think this Hollywood dramatization of what happened was fine, even though it was not 100% accurate like a documentary would be. It is a Hollywood film. I did like how they incorporated REAL footage into the movie so effortlessly; it gave it realism. I liked the film from start to finish. The cast was great and they really did look like their REAL life counterparts which you can tell when you see the real life videos that were incorporated into the film at the end.However, this is not a perfect movie. There were two sides to this crisis that happened in the Boston Bombings: one side was a MEDICAL crisis and the other side was a SECURITY crisis. This movie only showed glimpses of the medical crisis; I mean this was a total disservice to the medical personnel, the HEROES, that saved lives during this catastrophe and tended to the injured. Instead this movie focused on how police officers and the FBI haunted down and found the bombers. This movie ONLY DEPICTS AS HEROES the police officers and the FBI and completely forgot about the MEDICAL HEROES that took care of all the injured people and lives they saved.Conclusion: this is a HOLLYWOOD film that dramatized the events of a horrendous terrorist attack and portrays police, FBI, and city officials as heroes. This film does attempt to be realistic by having cast that look like their real-life counterparts as well as by incorporating real life footage. The casting and actors were good, the screenplay/script was great, the director, etc., all was good actually. it is a good film. However, this Hollywood film is NOT 100% accurate as a documentary would be, and also they did not give the medical heroes (doctors & nurses) fair time and recognition in the film who were INDISPENSABLE during this two-sided (security & medical) catastrophe.8/10",Patriots Day,4572514
48,jtindahouse,Beautifully handled and a hell of a watch,9/10,8 March 2017,"Movies based around the September 11th terrorist attacks have always been met with much controversy. A lot of people think using the film to aide your story, such as a film like 'Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close' did in 2011, is out of line and unnecessary. Then there are the films like 'United 93' which were based around the actual happenings of that fateful day. Those too managed to draw controversy, but I don't really see why. The fact is these events happened. As awful as they are, people have the right to see the stories brought to life. If they are too sensitive to you, don't watch them. Very simple. 'Patriot's Day' follows the story of the Boston Marathon bombings of 2013. They weren't quite on the scale of 9/11 obviously, but they were still a pretty big deal felt around the globe. I thought writer/director Peter Berg did a fantastic job in telling the story of the event and the days that followed. He found a way to make sure every character was included in what felt like an equal way. Even having a star on board like Mark Wahlberg never detracted from the other characters. That, mixed with the splicing of real footage in the appropriate moments, all made for a very well made film.It's also a brilliantly paced film. The 133 minute run time absolutely flies by. I had worried a bit going in that there would be a lot of filler, but that certainly wasn't the case. Not a minute in this film is put to waste. It can be a tough watch it must be said. There are some pretty serious scenes that are a little grizzly to watch. Even if you need to wait a few more years though and let the sensitivity die down, make sure you see this film at some point. It's one not to be missed.",Patriots Day,4572514
49,MOscarbradley,I found this movie offensive.,3/10,17 January 2019,"One of the problems with a film like ""Patriot's Day"" is that the individual, personal stories of the victims and those caught up in the terrible events of the day in question mean very little to people outside of the United States, but more significantly should we even be making movies like this, films that deal with recent real-life tragedies where there is no historical perspective? The film may claim to honor the memory of the victims and yet ""Patriot's Day"" is filmed in such a way that it becomes simply a very well-made suspense movie with a strong sentimental streak running through it.There's no denying it's very well crafted but I also found it offensive; this isn't fiction like the disaster movies of the seventies. These people really lived and died and here is a movie that is being sold outside of America as if it were nothing more than a disaster flick, (and even in America I can't see people accepting it as anything other than that). It is certainly exciting and for that very reason, it also leaves a bad taste in the mouth. A good cast do what they can with a cliche-ridden script and I would hope it was made with the best of intentions but this is a movie that needed a much more documentary-like approach than the one it gets.",Patriots Day,4572514
50,mbeaupre,To all the morons that said the bombing was fake.,9/10,26 January 2017,"Tell that to my friend who's 8 year old son died that day during the day. Same guy that also had daughter lose her leg during that bombing. I have several other friends that were there that day that saw the bomb go off from a relatively safe distance. The fact that you knuckleheads piece together various bits of (mis)information and concoct stories rationalizing why you believe it was a hoax is utterly ridiculous and extremely offensive to those people who were injured/died and to their families. Get a life conspiracy theorists.The movie was relatively well done. It started a bit slow as I thought it was going to be very predictable but about halfway through, it took some turns that kept you on your toes. Being from Massachusetts I typically love Boston based movies. And this does not disappoint. It was probably my favorite Boston based movie.

51,Screen_Blitz,Patriots Day is a riveting tribute to it's real-life tragedy with an alluring story and direction in the bargain,8/10,25 January 2017,"Our country is no stranger to terrorist attacks, and though we have not experienced any sort of event on the scale of the 9/11 attacks, terrorism has increased in a near-alarming rate. This police procedural drama directed by Peter Berg, the filmmaker behind 'Deepwater Horizon' which hit theaters just four months ago, paints a riveting picture of a shocking tragedy that gripped our nation to it's core. That tragedy was the April 15, 2013 Boston Marathon Bombing by that took a great number of innocent lives. Collaborating with Peter Berg for a third time is Mark Wahlberg who we saw in 'Deepwater Horizon' not too long ago along with the war drama 'Lone Survivor' three years ago. Like Peter Berg's previous two entries, Wahlberg along with a string of A-list actors shine in this moving docudrama following the heroes that sought out justice against the tyrants responsible for the horrifying tragedy. Inspired by true events, Mark Wahlberg plays police officer Tommy Saunders who's assigned by Commissioner Ed Davis (played by John Goodman) who patrol the street on the morning of the Boston Marathon. What starts off as an exciting day turns into a blistering tragedy at the sound of pressure cooker bombs going off in the crowd. With several casualties and many others rushed to the hospital, Saunders, Davis, along with Sergeant Jeffrey Pugliese (played by J.K Simmons) must collaborate with FBI agent Richard DesLauriers (played by Kevin Bacon) to hunt down the Muslim terrorists (played by Alex Wolff and Themo Melikidze) responsible for the bombing.Peter Berg rarely pulls punches when re-imagining real-life events on screen (as demonstrated in his previous two films), nor does he take sheer sentimentality for granted which splashes in our faces during the final twenty minutes. And similarly to 'Deepwater Horizon' and 'Lone Survivor', Berg effectively present a real-life tragedy into a cinematic entry not geared to entertain, but to tell an honest story of the tragedy that unfolded. This film opens up the night before the tragedy before quickly shifting to the day of the Boston Marathon where the participants and the spectators were gutted with a huge explosion that claims a great number of lives. Although the bombing sequence is highly predictable for those familiar with the event, it does virtually nothing to eliminate the sense of dread and anxiety during the opening minutes of the marathon. Following the gruesome imagery of the debacle, this film ventures through the story of the statewide manhunt after the terrorist involved in the incident. For those who keep an open eye on the news, it is easy predict the final outcome. But the film explores the untold trajectory of the manhunt, and Peter Berg executes the event in a series of pulse-pounding sequences with solidly crafted thrills and shock. Along the way (mostly during the beginning), the story also explores a multiplex of characters connected to the incident including the domestic lives of the terrorists Dzhokhar Tsarneav and his brother Tamerlan Tsnarneav who's sinister motives aren't given too much depth but are thinly hinted through their commentary of America's supposed ""islamophobia"". One of their conversations consists of a 9/11 conspiracy that the government used as a tool for promote hatred Muslims. As jarring as it sounds, it partly accounts the brooding chemistry between these two as they steal the screen in not one, but two incredibly startling scenes during the final third.Peter Berg populates the story with a wide range of characters that the film rarely breathes any time to develop most of these characters other than Mark Wahlberg's Tommy Saunders and the aforementioned Muslim brothers. But if there is anything keep most of these character breathing with authenticity, it is the cast's solid performances. With Mark Wahlberg teaming up with director Peter Berg for the third time, he steps into the shoes of not a real-life figure but a fictional character inspired by a composite of the real-life heroes involved the seeking of justice. Like in 'Deepwater Horizon' and 'Lone Survivor', Wahlberg comes out on screen with a bang. John Goodman, Kevin Bacon, and J.K Simmons also stand very rigid in their roles; though nothing that shouts for powerful memorability considering the underdeveloped characters. Michelle Monaghan provides a decent on screen presence but it sadly left with very little to do other than provide as a filler. Arguably two of the most alarming performances are Alex Wolff and Themo Melikidze who suit up in the roles of nefarious terrorists, and with a competent screenplay are nicely portrayed with legitimacy rather than exploitation. That is doesn't however, reduce how dark and grim nature of their antagonistic characters.Patriots Day is a riveting tribute to the victims of the Boston Marathon Bombing, with an alluring direction by Peter Berg and a story set to inspire. Though it does not shy away the run-of-the-mill tropes of the police drama genre, it effectively breathes life into a story that is set not to necessarily entertain but to inspire.",Patriots Day,4572514
52,rockman182,Patriots Day (2016),7/10,12 January 2017,"Peter Berg returned very soon after Deepwater Horizon, with yet another film based on a true event. Patriots Day is a film based on the 2013 Boston marathon bombings by the Tsarnaev brothers. Interestingly, this film also circles around a fictional cop (played by Mark Wahlberg) so we've got a mix of fiction with reality. I'm not the biggest fan of Berg's films but there is no denying he can do tense action scenes very well.The film is a mixed bag but I'm leaning more on the positive side. The film's depictions of the violence and gore minutes after the attack, do not hold back. You don't expect it to either, especially if you are aware of Berg's track record. The sheer brutality of the event is captured, much like the war violence captured in Lone Survivor. Some of the chase and gunfights is absolutely enthralling as well. The final showdown between the older Tsarnaev and the police is very well done. It is gripping and remarkably captivating. I understand the original account of the events is a haze but the encounter must have been intense, going by the films depiction.Getting back to the mixed bag bit here are the few things that detract from the film. The film starts out introducing a bunch of characters who are impacted in one way or the other by the event. This is necessarily not a bad thing in and of it self but it takes away from the films focus and too many characters equates for not enough weight given to each other. Some characters are purely devices to elicit an emotional response. The film also suffers from a long run time, condensing the film would have led to a more focused effort. The film seems to be a mishmash at times. The director must have wanted to just include all the scenes filmed, which impacts the narrative element of the film.I was also not sure about the film being made. The events are very fresh and must still be really shocking for a lot of people impacted by the event. I can see why people would find this film to be exploitative. But on the other hand, films are a good way of educating people on the events of a true story. I assume the film was fairly accurate, so even I was able to learn a lot about the events. Also, Alex Wolff seemed like a dead ringer for the younger bomber.It's just about what you expect from Peter Berg. A film that does action very well, but a film that suffers from bloated length and could have used a better approach to telling the story. The film isn't absolutely necessary however its quite enjoyable and will provide for an entertaining, emotional, and enjoyable time for its viewers. I guess at the end of the day that's what you want from your media.7/10",Patriots Day,4572514
53,cruise01,Patriots is an effective thriller showing the crisis of the Boston Marathon tragedy,9/10,17 January 2017,"Patriots Day a drama thriller based on the Boston Marathon bombing pays a great tribute to the lives that were taken and the officers that put their lives on the line to protect us against evil. It is a remarkable film that shows Boston's finest and how every one will stick together to fight against America's tragedy on April of 2013. Peter Berg and Mark Wahlberg team up for the third time and also on a film that is also based on real events. They did great with their previous films like Lone Survivor and Deepwater Horizon. Berg direction is remarkable and close to these people that went through these dark times. The horrible tragedy took away a few innocent lives and left many injured and amputated from the Boston Marathon event. The plot focuses on Boston officer Tommy Saunders (Mark Wahlberg) and his perspective on most of the tragic event. Also, several characters that the film followed from the survivors and victims like a young couple that were there at the marathon. Also, a young college stationed officer, and a young kid Dun Meng, who was carjacked by Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev. The film has a few side stories with introducing us to these people but how they were involved and the direction is done so well. That we feel for these people and how they were all affected by this event. It is an emotionally powerful film seeing these officers in this manhunt and trying to protect their city from this terror. Berg does well in building the suspense and tension in the beginning of the film. Seeing Officer Tommy starting his day, trying to win his reputation back from being suspended. Then, we are introduced to FBI Richard (Kevin Bacon), who leads the team into a manhunt for the Tsarnaev brothers. From following up with surveillance profiling to asking for the public to help with any recording devices they have used during the marathon. The film does have an intense feel, as Berg does not get carried away with Hollywood big action set up. But more of a grounded shoot out sequence, that brings a lot of chaos onto the screen when the officers are on the brothers trail. And involved in a neighborhood shoot out. With the recognized officers or those involved. These people you are emotionally affected by when they are facing danger. They all deserve the recognition for their bravery. The film music composer Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross is also stunning that works well with the tone they are trying to make with the movie. The script works well with making these characters believable and making it a tough movie to watch. Patriots Day is an emotionally powerful film that shows Berg's direction being at its finest and Mark Wahlberg delivering a strong performance. The ending showing the real people involved and interviews with the survivors is a tough one to see. I definitely recommend.",Patriots Day,4572514

55,doorsscorpywag,Spoilt by Tommy Saunders,5/10,12 January 2017,A very well done film about the events. The ending was the most effective part as the victims and some of the heroes got their voice. The idea by some here that because only 3 people died it was unworthy of having a film made about it is silly. I am English and we know plenty about bombings here as we had the IRA for 30 years funded by places such as Boston. But we here have empathy with Boston as we do with dozens of places around the world that suffered like they did. 3 or 3000 it's all the same just the numbers are different. It's still a tragedy for those affected by the events.But inserting a fictional cop into the events was frankly an insult to those who were really there.Mark Wahlberg as the ridiculous Tommy Saunders stank the movie out. Foul mouthed and abusive towards the FBI it seemed as if the investigation would have faltered if not for him. This fool was in every important event in the movie. At one point I was expecting him to storm the boat single handed.Surely they could have told the same story using the people who actually did these things instead of him grabbing their plaudits and being congratulated during and after for being the most hard working cop in Boston.It spoilt a worthy movie. His character was detrimental to the film and his acting performance really annoying. The movie itself was very good when Wahlberg was not in it and the acting by the rest of the cast was good.But overall it was spoilt by the casting of Wahlberg and his character Tommy Saunders.,Patriots Day,4572514
56,Cinemaniac1984,A gripping drama which had me glued to my seat from start to finish.,9/10,12 February 2017,"Patriots Day brilliantly and respectfully tells the story of the tragic Boston Marathon bombing on the fateful day of 15 April 2013 which shook the city of Boston to its core. The movie crosses between the Tsarnaev brothers who were responsible for the Boston bombing and the citywide manhunt which included the Boston Police Department, the FBI and later the Watertown Police Department.On 15 April 2013, Tamerlan Tsarnaev (Themo Melikidze) and Dzokhar Tsarnaev (Alex Wolff) set off two bombs at the finish line at the Boston Marathon, killing three people and severely maiming hundreds of others. The Boston Police Department and the FBI spearhead a taskforce to find the now infamous Boston bombers and bring them to justice. Amongst those that are tasked to take down the Boston bombers include Sergeant Tommy Saunders (Mark Wahlberg), Commissioner Ed Davis (John Goodman), Special Agent Richard DesLauriers (Kevin Bacon), and Watertown Police Sergeant Jeffrey Pugliese (J.K. Simmons). As the net closes in on the Tsarnaev brothers while the city of Boston has been shaken to its core, the brothers continue to leave a trail of destruction in their path as they attempt to evade capture.Mark Wahlberg has always been a likable actor and he does not put a foot wrong as Sergeant Tommy Saunders. Kevin Bacon, John Goodman and J.K Simmons were terrific in their respective roles. The rest of the supporting cast including Michelle Monaghan, Michael Beach, Vincent Curatola and Melissa Benoist do a fine job as well. Alex Wolff and Themo Melikidze didn't have an easy job portraying the widely despised Tsarnaev brothers, but both actors should be credited with doing a terrific job.Peter Berg may have had some hits and misses as a director, but Patriot's Day is definitely one of his most memorable movies, right besides Friday Night Lights (2004), The Kingdom (2007) and Lone Survivor (2013).On a personal note, I've visited Boston in 2008 and 2014 and I've always had a memorable time visiting Boston. Even after my first visit in 2008, Boston was my favourite city that I visited while in the USA. Upon hearing about the Boston bombing in the news in 2013, my heart went out to the city and those killed and severely injured.To be perfectly honest, I thought Patriot's Day would be a run of the mill drama, however I was very surprised. With terrific direction, a powerhouse cast, and a gripping story that cuts to the chase, I was glued to my seat in the cinema from start to finish which also saw me secretly cheering for the police to take down the Boston bombers. It would not have been an easy task, but Patriot's Day did a terrific job revisiting that horrific day in 2013 which shook Boston to its core but reuniting Boston together and from that day forward, forging the slogan ""Boston Strong"". Patriot's Day is gripping viewing that is well worth watching.9/10.",Patriots Day,4572514
57,kaptenvideo-89875,"It's us versus them, and the big boys are coming!",7/10,9 January 2017,"2013's the Boston Marathon Bombing the Hollywood version. First responders and investigators are racing against the clock to hunt down the sneaky Muslim bombers before they strike again. It can't be watchable to anyone but American patriots, right?Wrong. ""Patriots Day"" is actually a solid action thriller which seems realistic enough, even handling some more trivial details like how the bombers look like exactly. It avoids the excessive corniness and epic-ness till the last minutes and plays it like a catastrophe movie followed by exciting manhunt. The cameras are out there with us, in the middle of it all, and it still looks good. Another good example of how to handle the shaky in-your-face style of action that is often strongly disliked or even hated in movies.The stories of the main characters are rather vague and shallow, so good that they are relegated to sidelines. Mark Wahlberg has one of the biggest roles and does his usual thing which seems really pretty interesting only for the maybe first three times you see him in movies.You know, that humble and tender joe everyman that has a big heart but also gets sh*t done where it really matters. Like a action version of Adam Sandler or something.There are some big boyz of Hollywood involved, to make the movie more solid and prestigious, including John Goodman, Kevin Bacon and underused J. K. Simmons. It's amazing how effective this kind of playaz can be to bring almost any story to life. They make serious faces, talk their serious talk and make the world a better place. Works every time. ""Patriots Day"" is a tight enough package already... and they make it even more watch-worthy. Seriously.Boston Marathon bombing is good basis for a Hollywood movie. It's recent and true-life, so it can turn populist without getting too much criticism for it, and there's also creative freedom to add pretty much anything you want to a story.So no wonder there are more movies on the horizon. ""Stronger"" with Jake Gyllenhaal in the lead is coming already, and there's also some project called Boston Stronger""...All in all, this is certainly by far the most fun I've had watching a movie directed by Peter Berg. He's always good with action and usually boring handling everything else (""The Kingdom"", ""Battleship"", ""Hancock"", ""Lone Survivor"" and ""Deepwater Horizon"", among others).",Patriots Day,4572514
58,Solnichka,"No need for this film whatsoever ... just more attempts to make Boston seem ""strong""",2/10,8 January 2017,"First, why was this movie made? Three people died. Big deal. How many people died in Oklahoma City back in 1995? Almost 200, including CHILDREN, yet filmmakers decided *this* was more worthy of a movie? Please. This was nothing.That being said, every actor in this movie takes the ""Boston thing"" too far ... enough with Wahlberg already. Director Peter Berg should have cast someone not so laughable in the lead role. But I guess Matt Damon wasn't available? Kept waiting for Ben Affleck to show up, along with the rest of the ""Good Will Hunting"" cast of characters. J.K. Simmons is alright, because he's J.K. Simmons. But John Goodman was better as Babe Ruth than he is in this film.This whole movie is just a token effort to augment Boston's inferiority complex with the greater cities in this country (NYC, for example, which suffered REAL tragedy on 9/11). Waste of time, waste of money, waste of celluloid. Again, if filmmakers want to make a real film about a real tragedy, try OKC instead. Or maybe they're just afraid to cover DOMESTIC terrorism and chose this film to enhance America's illogical and irrational fear of Islam.",Patriots Day,4572514

60,lavatch,One Day on Boylston,8/10,29 March 2017,"""Patriot's Day"" recreates the tragic events of the April 2013 Boston Marathon bombings from the horrific day on Boylston to the arrest of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev in the boat.The film is told primarily from the perspective of a cocky police officer played by Mark Wahlberg, who sympathetically portrays a cop with a heart named Tommy Saunders. The film is especially well cast with J. K. Simmons as the crusty sergeant, Michelle Monaghan as Tommy's long-suffering wife who could not produce a baby, and Kevin Bacon, who looks more like an FBI agent than the real life Rick Deslauriers. John Goodman effectively plays police chief Ed Davis.One of the most interesting scenes was the government interrogation of Katherine Russell, the wife of the older of the Tsarnaev brothers. In the interpretation of the filmmakers, Russell clearly had advance knowledge of the explosive devices manufactured her home, yet chose not to disclose any knowledge she had about this despicable act of terrorism.There was a gritty realism in nearly everyone of the scenes in the film. It was clear that the federal authorities should have been keeping the Tsarnaev brothers on their radar--an enormous national security breakdown. The Boston police should never have opened fire on the boat, as the principal objective was to capture the second terrorist alive. And should the entire city of Boston have been placed on lockdown during the search for Dzhokhar? The film raises but does not take a stand on these important issues.""Patriot's Day"" is at its best in demonstrating the heroic stature of the respondents who tended to the victims. One of the most moving moments of the film was one dedicated police officer keeping vigil over a dead body on Boylston, then saluting when the body was taken away. That moment characterized the true spirit of ""Boston Strong.""",Patriots Day,4572514

This movie will blow you away with the acting and the vast events and characters and the acting is phenomenal.

62,virek213,"April 15, 2013: Horror And Heroism In Boston",9/10,17 January 2017,"After September 11, 2001, America was no longer immune to the ravages of international terrorism. Although the 9/11 attacks on New York, Washington, and Pennsylvania, which killed nearly three thousand people, were never replicated inside America's borders, there have nevertheless been terrorist incidents since then, two of them during 2015 and 2016, in San Bernardino, California (in December 2015), and Orlando, Florida (in June 2016). But perhaps the biggest terrorist incident occurred on April 15, 2013 at the finish line of the 117th annual Boston Marathon. Two pressure cooker bombs packed in backpacks and left along the sidewalk along Boylston Street, close to the end of the race, exploded in the crowd, killing three people and wounding 264 others, some of them quite severely. The full forces of the Boston Police Department, the state law enforcement of Massachusetts, and the FBI, even with their occasional internecine feuding, worked together to track down the responsible parties, two Chechan brothers named Dzhokar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, a manhunt that took 100 hours and ended in a Boston suburb. This horrible day and the subsequent manhunt are the subject of the 2016 film PATRIOTS DAY (the designation for April 15th in Boston).The film's sizeable cast of stars features Mark Wahlberg as Boston cop Tommy Saunders, who was at the finish line on that day and at the moment when the two explosions went off, just 200 feet from where he was standing. Pretty soon, Boston police commissioner Ed Davis (John Goodman), FBI agent Rick DesLauriers (Kevin Bacon) and Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick (Michael Beach) are on hand to determine who pulled off the horror at the marathon. But in the meanwhile, the two suspects (portrayed by Alex Wolff and Themo Melikidze) are still on the loose; and they kill MIT police officer Sean Collier (Jake Picking),following the kidnapping of a young Chinese national (Jimmy Yang). Melikidze is killed in a shootout with Watertown police and Massachusetts state troopers, but Wolff escapes. Hours later, however, he is found in a covered boat in a backyard of Watertown, a suburb of Boston. This ended one of the most sustained manhunts in U.S. history, in which the entire city of Boston and its various suburbs were placed on a police-enforced lockdown until the two assailants were caught.While it must have been tempting for Peter Berg, who also directed 2016's DEEPWATER HORIZON and is known for his fairly ultra-conservative political beliefs, to make this an anti-Islamic diatribe, and thus red meat for right-wing fanatics, that tendency is instead set aside for a step-by step recreation of those 100 hours that had to have been the most frightening in the history of Boston. It is not surprising, of course, that the sequences of the bombings and the shootouts are incredibly realistic, horrifying, and quite graphic, and that the dialogue is equally salty and profane. But instead of just being another gung-ho action flick meant to be a bromide for blind patriotism, PATRIOTS DAY looks at the best of Boston's finest and the citizens they protect in a way that was done by director Paul Greengrass in his ultra-memorable 2006 9/11 film UNITED 93. No sympathy is spared for the Tsarnaev brothers or those that protected them (though it might have been a good idea to understand how they might have become radicalized the way they were, which wasn't via the traditional Al-Qaeda way, nor through the Islamic State); this is one of the few flaws of this film.Berg very skillfully manages to edit some of the actual on-scene video camera footage from the real-life incident, and along with the blanket coverage that all Boston TV news outlets, with his recreation of the manhunt in a way that is good for the filmmaking process, but which also faithfully recreates the series of events between the bombing and the eventual capture of the surviving Tsarnaev brother (who was sentenced to death via lethal injection in 2015), without trying to capitalize on the magnitude of the tragedy at hand. Wahlberg, Goodman, Bacon, and Simmons all do good work and reasonable Boston accents, while Michelle Monaghan is equally fine in a supporting role as Wahlberg's wife. All in all, considering that it touches on the thorny, emotionally complex, and politically charged subject of terrorism, PATRIOTS DAY does it in a way that shows the very sick nature of terrorism and how we can respond to it, not with the same blind hatred of terrorism's perpetrators, but with the love and empathy that makes us Americans.",Patriots Day,4572514
63,mr-roboto-kilroy,Over Rated!,2/10,20 March 2017,"There are certain types of movies that get a ""free pass"" and are automatically given good reviews because of the subject matter. Usually children's movies, religious movies, movies about gay or lesbians or any other controversial subjects, and movies about national tragedies. I find that this movie has received such good reviews from the critics because they are afraid to criticize it because they could be considered non-patriotic and it's not worth the hassle for them.First off, there are a few good actors in this, but ones whom are not really getting the best leads anymore. They are just okay and do a good job in this flick, but my main issue is with the poor direction, editing and camera work. I believe that the director wanted to go with an independent film look. You know what I mean. It's where they have two or three small HD Digital hand-held cams filming at a shaky POV angle. Then edited into quick scene changes. It reminds me of the type of filming/editing of the old TV Show, Hill St Blues. Some people might find this artistic, but I just found it nauseating. They zoom in way too close to everything and everyone and pan far too quickly. The shots are way too tight and way too shaky. It has a ""high school"" project feel to it. I couldn't really considerate on the movie most of the time, because I was trying to figure out if they were actually recording with good quality smart phones or not.I realize it is based on a true story and should get a ""free pass"", but I found it was very poorly done and it's like the director either just ""phoned it in"" or the director is simply a teenager who wants to break into the business with his first film and who is also the nephew of the top executive of a production company.",Patriots Day,4572514
64,KineticSeoul,Competent movie about the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing and the aftermath,7/10,15 January 2017,"I wasn't expecting much out of this movie when I first decided to check it out. To my surprise it's a competently made movie that kept me focused all the way through. I thought this was going to be straight by the numbers disaster movie, which will have some moments that will just drag on an on. To my surprise, it hit the emotional moments at the right moments and focused a good deal leading up the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing. And the aftermath when it comes to the people that got effected and the investigation in tracking down the culprits. The narrative is easy to follow and there wasn't any complexity when it comes to the investigation. That includes the simple cinematography that didn't seem to have much techniques put into it. Although some of the characters seemed over-dramatic, yeah it's was a very serious situation but it just felt pretentious at times. Unlike how it was in ""Zero Dark Thirty"", but this is a patriotic movie after all. However the most effective elements is how it shows all angles and perspective of the people that was involved in the bombing. Including the aftermath and what the people had to go through because of the bombers. Mark Wahlberg does what he does, but it works into this just fine and that includes all the other actors playing the people that was involved in the manhunt. The celebration at the end is one of the things I disagreed with in this film. It was probably to make it a good happy ending while showing the people coming together and not letting the bombings bring them down. But I personally think it should have gone in a more grim and dark direction, which shows the seriousness of it all. Despite showing how although the culprits were either apprehended or killed, isn't something to entirely celebrate about. Yes, it's a good thing that they managed to find the people that was responsible and was able to exact justice. I am glad justice was served and the bombers got what they deserved. And sure, it can be a celebration for some folks when the culprits that committed the deadly atrocity is caught or killed off. But after innocent peoples lives that were lost and the damages that was done by just two lunatics with malicious intents. I personally think it should have taken a more serious approach at the end instead of going on a happy we come together ending. It can work when it comes to fictional movies like ""Independence Day"". But when it comes to something that is based on a true event, when it comes to just two simpleminded terrorists causing destruction and affecting the lives of others in a negative way. The happy ending with everyone smiling, laughing and holding hands wasn't the right choice in my opinion. Even if life still goes on after the bombing. Which is why I think the ending to ""Zero Dark Thirty"" worked better. 7.8/10",Patriots Day,4572514
65,sunraider,Mediocre By-the-Numbers Tale,6/10,14 January 2017,"Patriot's Day is a a fairly routine by-the-numbers drama about the Boston Marathon bombings and the hunt for the two brothers. Unfortunately, instead of a docudrama giving us an inside look at the important political and LE players and the decisions made, the film focuses on Whalberg's fictional, composite character and he drags the movie down. Whalberg's ""Tommy Saunders"" is a fairly unlikable character. He's facing suspension, has a bad attitude, and hobbles around on an injured leg. Every time he came on screen the film lost momentum as it took the focus away from the really important decision makers. The film's run-time definitely seems padded with unnecessary scenes showing us the victims' mundane lives before the bombings and the domestic bliss and/or squabbles of the fictional Tommy Saunders and other law enforcement. There were only two sequences in the film that I found gripping. One was the carjacking/kidnapping and eventual escape by the Chinese man. I didn't recall that part of the event and I was genuinely concerned for and cared about the young man. The other sequence that stood out was the interrogation of the wife. It was dramatically underplayed and the tension was palpable. The film would have been better served had it concentrated on these types of realistic scenes and simply cast top-quality character actors instead of a top star that required extensive time in front of the camera. Love Mark Whalberg but he was totally unnecessary and actually a hindrance in this movie.",Patriots Day,4572514
66,LloydBayer,Patriots Day is a heartfelt tribute to the real life heroes of the Boston terror attacks.,7/10,10 January 2017,"Maybe people didn't take director Peter Berg too seriously when he made The Kingdom, a 2007 action-thriller about an Al-Qaeda attack on American expats in Riyadh. Berg's follow-up was 2013's Lone Survivor, a dramatized account of Navy SEALs being ambushed by Taliban insurgents in Afghanistan. Patriots Day marks the director's third film on anti-terrorism, and while the film is a raw and gruesome retelling of a tragic event, it is also a humble and heartfelt tribute to the real-life heroes portrayed in this film.Widely known for the annually held oldest marathon in the world, the city of Boston took a devastating hit on 'Patriots' Day', 15th April 2013, following coordinated attacks by home grown terrorists. Co-written by Berg, the narrative is a time-stamped account starting from the early hours of that fateful day. We see loved ones saying their goodbyes like any other day; some are runners getting ready for the marathon, while others are onlookers at the now-iconic Boylston Street. While this is happening, we are also shown the Tsarnaev brothers who would perpetrate the attacks. Revealing their identities quite early in the film is Berg's plot device to induce a foreboding sense of what is about to happen. As such, scarier than seeing them pack pressure-cooker bombs into their backpacks is the vague explanation behind the attack. We are not entirely sure if the motive is a hate crime or Jihadi influenced. Instead, Berg's focus is on the bloody and horrific aftermath of the explosions.What follows is a manhunt for the brothers even as law enforcement teams are put through the arduous task of examining tons of CCTV footage. These include Mark Wahlberg and J.K. Simmons as police officers, John Goodman as the police commissioner and Kevin Bacon representing the FBI. Though Wahlberg anchors scenes of chaos and is practically everywhere in the film, his Officer Tommy Saunders is the only character who isn't based on a real person during the marathon bombings. So why does Wahlberg play a fictional character when the film is based on an actual event? Aside from his third collaboration with the director, Wahlberg's Saunders represents a dramatized combination of the law enforcement and Boston public who responded in unity to smoke out the terrorists. The strategic placement of Boston's resilience to terror is also evident in the missing apostrophe in the title, thus making everyone involved a patriot, much like how Saunders is the everyman of Boston city.In retrospect, anyone following the news would be aware that this turned out to be the worst attack on US soil after 9/11. But unlike the islamophobia hoopla incited in The Kingdom, Berg's nuance in this film is a balanced yet vigorous retelling of a dark episode for the people of Boston. It isn't as thrilling or packed with urgency as Lone Survivor and there are also tonal shifts when a serious moment can turn unexpectedly funny. But pieced together with actual footage and images from the media and the public, Patriots Day feels more like a straightforward docudrama than mere entertainment for the masses. The solemn epilogue more than drives that message home; and along with it an emotional wallop on how tragedy can bring out the best in a community.",Patriots Day,4572514

68,SimonJack,Very good film about the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing,9/10,16 August 2017,"Made just three years after the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, ""Patriots Day"" tells the story of the infamous event, including the pursuit of the terrorists. The film adds two fictional characters to a plot that includes 281 listed real people from the event. Mark Wahlberg plays fictional Boston police sergeant Tommy Saunders, and Michelle Monaghan plays his wife, Carol. The use of a fictional character is an age-old device in novels and movies about historical events. Where such stories often move back and forth between any number of characters, a fictional character is a focal point from which to view the event as it unfolds. It's a device that works well. This movie also must have set a record for use of the F-word. I don't know if that was fiction or real, but the dialog is riddled with ""F that,"" F this,"" and F it."" If it's real, then the Boston Police Department can be proud (or not) of being the most foul-mouthed of any law agency on film to date.The movie is based partly on two books written about the April 2013 bombings and the capture of the terrorists. The cast includes characters in the police, FBI and other authority roles, and several of the bombing victims. Others were marathon observers and rescue and hospital personnel. Some of the real people are interviewed or shown at the end of the film.This is not a movie made for entertainment, but to look back on a tragic event and to celebrate the local people who responded to help in the crisis. The hoopla about Bostonians coming together after the event, and the bravura that Boston will not be conquered by such events seems too much and out of place. I think the film speaks for itself in showing the responses of so many who helped the victims. The trumpeting at the end of the film cheapens it just a bit. But this is a very good film and slice of life of many people in Boston over four days in April 2013. All aspects of this film are excellent. Why the film didn't receive a single nomination for an Academy Award is baffling to me. Especially since the National Board of Review named ""Patriots Day"" one of the top 10 films of 2016. Nor did it do well at the box office, just earning $50 million worldwide against a budget of $45 million. Why the turnout at theaters was so disappointing may say something about the American culture less than two decades into the 21st century. Hollywood turns out a plethora of fictional action crime films filled with violence, murder and mayhem. And the public flocks to see those films. And millions of people, especially the young to middle-aged, play electronic games of the same type. But when it comes to seeing what happens of this nature in the real world, people don't want to see it. They turn a blind eye. Unlike many of the fiction flicks that show the local police and FBI as mortal opponents, ""Patriots Day"" shows a realistic picture of law enforcement units working together. One scene stands out where there is a disagreement. John Goodman, playing Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis, wants the photos of the suspected terrorists released to the public. He notes that people may recognize them and give the police and FBI leads. Kevin Bacon plays FBI special agent Richard LesLauriers who doesn't want the photos released. He wants to get more information and says that releasing the photos would alert the terrorists who would then run. The photos were leaked to the press, and as the movie shows, the terrorists ran. As a result, two policeman died and several others were wounded. Had the authorities waited, they may have followed leads to corner the terrorists in their home. The film shows three college friends of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev who were convicted for interfering with the investigation and sentenced to prison. When they see Dzohokhar's picture in the press, they don't report it to the authorities. And they find materials for making bombs in his locker. One would hope that these low-life characters aren't indicative of a large segment of the youth in our colleges these days. An even more interesting scene is that in which Tamerlan Tsarnaev's wife, American-born Katherine Russell (played by Melissa Benoist) is questioned. This most likely was recorded, so the film dialog may be what she actually said. In response to a female FBI agent, she says, ""For a Muslim woman, marriage is a lilting dance of duality – strength and submission. Beautiful, selfless, rapturous love of two masters, the carnal and the divine. The life a Muslim woman lives is a dangerous and difficult one, for if she does not submit to her husband, there is a spot reserved for her in hell. Yes. My husband kissed me before he left and he will kiss me again when I see him in heaven. And you can't prove anything.""While Wahlberg's Tommy Saunders is a fictional character, he has one good line toward the end that doesn't have a single F-word. Describing his take on the eve of the bombing to a fellow cop, Tommy says in part, ""That's all I saw today. Good versus evil, love versus hate. The devil hits you like that, there's one weapon you have to fight back with – its love. That's the only thing he can't touch.""This is not a movie for the faint of heart. But it is one most people should see. If for no other reason, than to be aware of the reality and horror of terrorism.",Patriots Day,4572514
69,trashgang,really good,8/10,15 July 2017,"Flick about the bombing at the Boston marathon so you know that this is going to be hard to watch because be honest, innocent people died there. The acting was sublime, sadly I can't say of all the things shown really happened that way because the pursuit between the cops and the victims and all the bombs going off in the streets, I can't say if that's true but it do gives this flick a special feeling about the people in Boston all getting stronger out of the attack and working together to hunt down the bombers.All acting is above mediocre, a thing you really need in this kind of flicks. Another nice surprise in a year two real events were transformed in a flick and both are really good (Sully). If you only have seen the bombs going off and do wonder what happened afterwards go pick this one up.Gore 1,5/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 3/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5

70,Turfseer,Fitting tribute to Boston Marathon victims as well as gripping action-thriller,8/10,30 July 2017,"A nice mixture of fiction and fact, Patriots Day is Peter Berg's chronicle of the terrorist attack on the 2013 Boston Marathon and its aftermath. Mark Wahlberg stars as Boston Police Sergeant Tommy Saunders, a composite character based on various real people in law enforcement who were involved in the aid to the survivors of the bombing and subsequent investigation.Patriots Day starts off rather slowly, mapping out where the principal characters were before the evil brothers Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev commenced their dirty work. The Tsarnaevs are also profiled in the pre-bombing snapshot, as we're introduced to them as ordinary looking folk along with Tamerlan's Muslim-American wife, who figures prominently later in the narrative, when she's grilled by a team of crack investigators who specialize in interviewing terror suspects.Once the bombings occur, the action is non-stop and best described as riveting. Of course the injuries to the victims probably don't appear as horrific as they were for those who observed them in real life, but Berg manages to intersperse actual footage from the scene that results in a fairly convincing verisimilitude.A fascinating piece of the narrative is the behind-the-scenes investigation into the bombings, with FBI agent Richard DesLauriers (played by a highly effective Kevin Bacon) facing pressure from others when he initially declines to release information on the suspects.One fact I wasn't aware of was that the Tsarnaev brothers took a Chinese student, Dun Meng, hostage, after carjacking his vehicle. Perhaps one of the most exciting scenes in the film is when Meng escapes his captors and then becomes a certifiable hero by recalling his GPS coordinates, which assists law enforcement in locating the Tsarnaevs.As it transpired, the Tsarnaevs ended up in Watertown, a suburb of Boston, where the confrontation with the local police went down. J. K. Simmons bears a striking resemblance to the real Watertown Police Sergeant Jeffrey Pugliese, who actually tackled Tamerlan, and narrowly avoided death himself when Dzhokhar escaped, but not before running over his brother in a car.The massive manhunt for Dzhokhar is ably chronicled, but one wonders how Saunders keeps popping up all over the place (especially in the middle of Waterown), since he's supposed to be a Boston beat cop (of course this is a matter of dramatic license, as Saunders is a composite character who is supposed to tie everything together).Wahlberg does well portraying the edgy Saunders who can't hide the fact that he has a chip on his shoulder. The rest of the cast is uniformly excellent including a slimmed-down John Goodman as the Boston police commissioner.Patriots Day not only is an excellent action-thriller but manages to provide a fitting tribute to the victims of the carnage inflicted by the terrorists. It should definitely be on your must-see list for the films released in the last year.",Patriots Day,4572514
71,ctowyi,Respectful and powerful dramatisation,8/10,18 January 2017,"Peter Berg has always been an iffy scattered genre director - he can churn out popcorn throwaway entertainers like Battleship (2012) and The Rundown (2003), wayward routine action-ers like Hancock (2008) and The Kingdom (2007), but his last two movies Lone Survivor (2013) and Deepwater Horizon (2016) have seen him delve into fact-based stories of heroism. Through his last two films, one can easily notice Berg honing his skills and with Patriots Day he has gotten it right. The learning curve is evident in that he has learned to dial down that American #1 jingoistic histrionics and is finally able to achieve the fine balance between connecting with the audience on a deeper level and succeeding as pure adrenaline entertainment. Patriots Day deconstructs the events of the Boston Marathon Bombing in 2013 and the ensuing manhunt for the terrorists in a stone-cold adrenaline pumping fashion. The docudrama opens with an unrelated problematic arrest in which Saunders busts his knee and we get a quick introduction of our titular salt-of-the-earth fictional cop and we see the initial traumatic events through his eyes. We are quickly and efficiently given introductions to all the important players and the peripheral ones, including the terrorists that will feature in the story. All in all we are just given enough to show us that everyone has something to live for., nothing feels jackhammered into our brains. The opening act is one crisply edited and vividly crafted segment of economical story construction. After the explosions, the movie wastes no time in moving into police procedural trajectory and this is when it hits heart-parked-in-your-mouth territory. There are so many scenes that are gems here - Saunders walking a reconstruction of the crime scene, an escape from a car-jacking, a spine-chilling interrogation, the gun-fight showdown at a residential street. Berg never glamourises any party and simply lays out the facts in linear form with time stamps. The movie recreates the events faithfully with the cloying melodrama wisely dialled down and the light never fails to shine down on the people of Boston, the real heroes of the tragedy. Throughout the movie, it remains respectful to the victims and the law enforcement agencies involved and celebrates their consummated efforts in apprehending the terrorists. Berg never presses the exploitative button and that immediately makes the movie memorable. Every individual feels like real human beings with authentic sensitivities and moral stakes. He has found his niche and he is revelling in a genre that seldom offers surprises and few have done as well.",Patriots Day,4572514
72,FlashCallahan,Sends a strong message......but too soon?....,7/10,20 February 2017,"Almost disgraced Police Sgt, Tommy Saunders is taking security duty at the Boston Marathon when an act of terror strikes with homemade bombs.As the wounded are cared for, Saunders and his colleagues join the FBI to get to the bottom of this attack.As the investigation continues, the terrorists realise that the authorities are close and attempt to flee the city to continue their 'work'.A police manhunt is commenced, involving shutting down the City of Boston to make sure the terrorists are captured.Despite the subject being very close to the hearts of many, Patriot's day is quite amusing in it's opening scene, and the chemistry that the screenplay gives the characters is overwhelmingly warm.Wahlberg is quite stunning as the weary Saunders, and you can see the strain the events take on him as the film progresses, much like Vincent's suit in Collateral.The banter between him and Goodman in the opening scenes is so real, that you would be forgiven if you thought they were best friends in real life.Once the film shows the despicable act, it doesn't let up until the very end with it's intensity. But what Berg does, is show a little empathy for the terrorists and their families. Yes what they did was unforgivable, but their quest to escape is just as intense as Saunders and the F.B.I to catch them.There are times when it does veer toward an action film film, rather than it's dramatic credentials state, and this makes those scenes, especially the shoot out toward the end, feel a little 'sexed up' to give the film a little more 'thrill'.But other than that minor flaw, it's a solid film, celebrating the courage of all those who were affected by that terrible event.Just don't get distracted too much by Goodman's eyebrows.",Patriots Day,4572514

75,neil-476,Has merit,8/10,14 May 2018,"In a mostly true reconstruction of the Boston Marathon bombing and its aftermath, Mark Wahlberg plays a fictitious character/composite policeman.The events portrayed in this film correspond fairly closely with my recollection of media coverage of the Boston Marathon bombings and the subsequent search for, pursuit and apprehension of the perpetrators. I am aware that Mark Wahlberg's character doesn't exist, being a device to enable some sort of narrative continuity to be applied to the a) bombing and b) pursuit elements of the film. Having said that, and much as I like Michelle Monaghan, the fictitious backstory of a fictitious character does not add to the credibility of the movie. Does this justify the excellent scene where Wahlberg returns home to find all his family in his house clamouring for information and failing to take any account of how massively traumatic the day has been for him? I'm not sure.The film is well staged and conveys a strong sense of being there, It is also gripping and entertaining, albeit respectful to the victims. Should films which portray true-life events be entertaining? I think perhaps they should, as long as they don't trivialise what happened to real people, which this film doesn't. An entertaining film conveys important events to a larger audience, which can only be a good thing.Wahlberg is good but, for me, the best scene is Khandi Alexander as a specialist terrorist interrogator, quizzing terrorist wife Katherine Russell (an unrecognisable Melissa Benoist) with a mixture of cosy coercion and clinical coldness.And I was pleased to see that the closing of the film resolved the stories of the people who had been affected, and how they are dealing with what happened to them.",Patriots Day,4572514
76,simonmiller_13,"Apple pie, with extra cheese !",2/10,22 March 2017,"How the hell did this get a seven point five stars? God this film was cringe worthy. Wahlberg plays an annoying (Very annoying), childish, gobby cop, who mysteriously is looked up to by his superiors. The film was trying to convey the shock and emotion of it all and failed miserably, it just came across as cheesy and self-serving. Don't watch this rubbish, instead just imagine a scene, the aftermath of a devastating terrorist bomb attack. Now add a massive Stars and Stripes flag fluttering and filling most of the shot. Then in the foreground, a Boston cop in full uniform, sobbing, one hand on his heart and the other saluting ... then picture this for 2 hours, because that basically sums up this entire film.

77,mcknz20,Emotional film of unity And courage through the people of Boston.,5/10,15 January 2017,"The Film ""Patriots Day (2016)"" is a tragic but true story that creates a seamless flow of real time and Re-enacted footage of the terrorist attack on Boston, which occurred on the 14th of April, 2013.The Acting was A-class (as expected) with the big names that came with it (Wahlberg, Goodman, Bacon, Monaghan and so on). The character relationships integrated well, you can feel the somewhat strained bonds between them and that adds to the emotions of the film experience. The action scenes were brilliantly executed with a ""natural and realistic"" feel too them which gave the films intensity.As someone who isn't from Boston nor the U.S, watching this film gave great clarity and depth to the events that occurred. This effect gives total props to the Director Peter Berg (Lone Survivor) and his co-writer Matt Cook (Triple 9)The final 10 minutes made the film all the more better and filled with emotional that tied the film in a special way (I'll let you see for your self!).However.... My initial thoughts were to question the necessity of the film. The events occurred not even 4 years ago, was it too soon? Was it completely necessary to convert to film? However since watching, this thought has yet to bother me again.Overall.. The resilience, strengths and unity among man/women was shown throughout this film, even in a time of crisis. This shows, that even when times are tough we can still band together as a society to help our fellow man and counter the destruction of terrorism.Great Film: 8/10",Patriots Day,4572514
78,DodsworthMcgillicutty,Authenticity Issues in History,1/10,5 April 2017,"I like this cast. Very disappointed in all of them for their participation. Yep this is a anti-propaganda review. Check ""not helpful"" now if you have Stockholm Syndrome.In 2012-2013, months before the ""event"", the 1948 Smith Mundt Act was Modernized. It's LEGAL Propaganda. Which means ANY and every story on corporate (state run?) television/film can be scripted according to National Defense. It means Nobody in corporate media will ever be jailed for CREATING news. Since day one of the 2013 event, armchair internet warriors have had an issue with the Bombing and it's authenticity. Quickly ""HOAX"" titled videos grew in popularity. And anyone taking the time to seek out their claims by reviewing videos will indeed find that Jeff Bauman was wheeled to safety across the finish line TWICE. OR that the Boston Globe STILL (as of April 2017) has the tweet up from earlier that day stating ""Officials: There will be a controlled explosion opposite the library within one minute as part of bomb squad activities."" Authenticity issues in this event are not a conspiracy, but indeed founded by anyone who cares to look. Who knows who was really hurt?The movie. Well, it gets worse. Turns out taking civilians cell phones ""for our safety"" is heroic. Things you are also supposed to learn in this film - If you have issues about the motives or official narrative of 9/11, you are just like the terrorists in this movie. Also kicking in doors, martial law style is good, because someone might be hiding in your pantry without your knowledge. In Patriots Day, Root for the hero, not the zero. Safety first!By the time the trailers appeared, some people caught on to the actual event's narrative problems, while other people who were hoodwinked by the bombing mainstream narrative thought this was exploitive and in poor taste. So the advertising campaign turned this into a ""Die Hard"" type genre movie, and hid the actual premise. By then it was too late, and this made a paltry $30 million by begging the public to see it. Earnings were DOA internationally. All the actors are very good, yet still embarrassing themselves in this tripe filmed Greengrass style mess. At least propaganda movie ""American Sniper"" was skillfully done, despite it's cringiness. Add ""Zero Dark 30"" for the ""legal propaganda"" trilogy. Berg, can do no right with me ever. I'll have to forgive Marky Mark though as Boogie Nights is an all-time favorite. And I'm positive ""Patriots Day"" is NOT his top 5, and was probably a blackmail gig, because like it or not, movie stars are somebody's property. They HAVE TO sign onto these movies when called upon. Somebody explain what good these ""real event"" films do for the world?",Patriots Day,4572514

Different characters are introduced at different times and it may take some time before we know where they fit in exactly, but the film is able to jump to different characters without losing any momentum. Mark Walhberg is so good in this. I usually enjoy his movies, this role was perfect for him and he nailed it! The city of Boston and the people in it are amazing!

There were a lot of missing gaps that got filled in that made the events that happened leading up to, the day of, and beyond... extraordinary.Having lived in Boston for a short time, I really felt the power of how this film showed Bostonians coming together during and after the attack.Hats off to Mark Wahlberg for getting involved (after initially turning it down) and making the film feel more Bostonian with his presence.This was an excellent film and I highly recommend it!",Patriots Day,4572514
81,parleon-thedon,Patriots Day - Review: Solid Courage,10/10,13 January 2017,"Peter Berg and Mark Wahlberg have worked together before, every time they do they create magic.Mark Wahlberg is not my favorite actor, but he and Peter Berg make a good team. Wahlberg's character and performance of were appealing.Peter Berg created something that kept it's audience locked in and engaged.If I had to sum this movie up with two words... tense and nail biting.This movie is an account of what transpired before and after the event of the bombing. Many character perspectives are present throughout this thing, they all have something to do, and they all play a part. At first, it seemed like the sub stories didn't have a sense of connectivity, but as the movie progressed it all eventually came to a head. I like the fact that we got to look into the lives of some regular bystanders who were at and affected by the event.The cast in Patriots Day is a powerhouse of talent. Kevin Bacon, John Goodman, and J.K. Simmons deliver nothing but some of the best performances you'll ever see on the big screen. All of the actors play their roles with professionalism and perfection.Peter Berg's movies are intense and sensitive. He doesn't shy away from getting down to the nitty-gritty. Some people might call his movies exploitative, but I don't think that's the case. Berg handles his movies with grace and ease. Even though he tackles serious subject matter, he knows how to convey a story. He makes you feel for the characters and situations.I cried throughout many scenes. Not only was the event horrific, but knowing that many people lost something during that madness were heartbreaking. I imagined myself in their situations. Seeing and having that sense of realizing what the people had to go through there is tragic. But, there was some light that shined down upon the darkness. People came together and united, and the movie illustrated that perfectly.The movie is intense. Action scenes feel like action scenes, but there's this sense of urgency. There's this sort of authenticity to Berg's action scenes. He tackles them head on, doesn't shy away from anything, and yet he gives us that feeling of I care about what's happening on a grand level.Overall, Patriots Day is a solid movie about strength and courage over fear. The performances here are solid, every actor delivers, and all their characters bring something to the table. Berg directs this movie with care, but he doesn't shy away from showing viewers the grim and gritty details.Final Grade: A",Patriots Day,4572514
82,jamiepaton-33876,Incredibly emotional story,9/10,10 August 2018,"After watching Patriots Day I'm honestly lost for words. Im struggling to think of things to say. Patriots Day isn't only an emotional drama, its also a tribute to all those who died in the bombings. It doesn't make a blockbuster out of these tragic events. It tells the story in an incredibly gritty way.Mark Wahlberg gives the best performance of his career as a boston police officer who has to deal with these attacks everyday throughout the man hunt. Several scenes stand out throughout the film. The best in my opinion are a shootout in Watertown and a scene where the bombers kidnap an innocent man. They are done in a suspenseful and tense way that make them some of the most gripping scenes I've ever seen.Overall, Patriots day deserves to be watched. Its only flaw is, I can't see myself watching it more than once because it is so dramatic the first time roundI've never really cried at a film...this was the first time that's happened XD",Patriots Day,4572514
83,spookyrat1,Comes Together!,8/10,4 March 2019,"Peter Berg has a propensity to make movies based on recent events with tragic outcomes. Lone Survivor was gripping. Deepwater Horizon sans much of an ecological message, just seemed quite pointless, being another (ho-hum!) disaster movie. With Patriots Day, he seems to have his mojo back telling a big, largely true story about a terrorist bomb attack during the 2013 Boston Marathon and its aftermath and successfully approaching it from different fronts.Ironically, though very well received critically and also by the audiences that have seen it, commercially it pretty much tanked with a main reason commonly cited being the involvement of ( Boston-born) Mark Wahlberg playing a composite police officer character. I think the criticisms are unfair and unfounded. Let's be very clear. Wahlberg doesn't play some super cop hero. He is more of a linkage character to the various sub-stories, arguably ensuring that a two and a quarter hour movie didn't blow out to being a three and a quarter how movie, by including extra real life characters and unnecessary exposition. As it stands the production team has done an excellent job casting a host of very competent actors who really do look like their real life counterparts. The post credits interviews, photos and news footage attests to this.BTW I should add here that there is a good deal of news footage integrated into the feature cleverly and seamlessly.Mention should also be made of the fact that the film doesn't just focus on the explosions and subsequent police/FBI/CIA manhunt for the perpetrators. That is the basis of the main thread, but the narrative does include stories of survivors, whilst tipping its hat, as mentioned in the final credits dedication to the first responders of these sort of emergencies; the fire brigades and medical personnel, besides the afore-mentioned police.That director Berg is able to fashion a coherent, suspenseful, drama out of this sad piece of history, whilst essentially telling a true, ultimately uplifting story is a credit to him as a story teller.",Patriots Day,4572514
84,jboothmillard,Patriots Day,5/10,13 September 2020,"I saw the trailer for this movie, based on a true story, in the cinema, it looked like it was going be something worthwhile, it did have average reviews by critics, but I was still up for it, directed by Peter Berg (Welcome to the Jungle, Lone Survivor, Deepwater Horizon). Basically, on April 15, 2013, on Patriots' Day, Sergeant Tommy Saunders (Mark Wahlberg) is working the security at the Boston Marathon. During the marathon, the Tsarnaev brothers, Dzhokhar (Alex Wolff) and Tamerlan (Themo Melikidze), detonate two bombs, causing widespread panic. Young couple Patrick Downes (Christopher O'Shea) and Jessica Kensky (Rachel Brosnahan) are separated to different hospital with severe injuries, they are both required to have their legs amputated. Family man Steve Woolfenden (Dustin Tucker) is also injured and separated from his toddler son, Leo (Lucas Thor Kelley), who is taken by an officer to a safe location. FBI Special Agent Richard DesLauriers (Kevin Bacon) is assigned to investigate the bombings alongn with Boston police commissioner Ed Davis (John Goodman), while Saunders searches for evidence and helps people that have been injured or separated from their loved ones in the chaos. Footage of the bombing is examined by FBI analysts and they identify Dzhokhar and Tamerlan as suspects, but DesLauriers is reluctant to release their pictures to the public without further evidence. But the pictures are leaked to the press, while men working for Watertown Police Sergeant Jeffrey Pugliese (J.K. Simmons) begin a door-to-door search for the pair. On the run, Dzhokhar and Tamerlan kill MIT officer Sean Collier (Jake Picking) trying to steal his pistol, and then carjack student Dun Meng (Jimmy O. Yang), telling him that they committed the marathon bombing and plan another bombing in New York City. Meng escapes after stopping in a fuel station and hides across the street, where he alerts the police on the whereabouts of the brothers after they drive away in his stolen car. Saunders arrives at the scene, learns of the brothers' plan, and is given the stolen car's GPS tracking number, leading police to the pair and an armed confrontation. Several officers are injured in the ensuing shootout, where the brothers use both firearms and bombs. While Tamerlan is shooting, Pugliese fires at his ankle, wounding him and stopping him gathering more explosives. Tamerlan orders Dzhokhar to run to New York City to continue the rampage. Tamerlan takes a last stand until he is subdued by the police. But zhokhar runs over his brother in his flight, killing him and makes his chaos. Meanwhile, Tamerlan's wife Katherine Russell (Melissa Benoist) and Dzhokhar's college friends Dias Kadyrbayev (Elijah Guo), Azamat Tazhayakov (Jin Yang Brancalhao), and Robel Phillipos (Brent Saunders) are brought in by the FBI and interrogated. Russell refuses to disclose any knowledge of her husband's illegal activities, quoting the Quran, while Dzhokhar's roommates appear oblivious to his plans, despite finding bomb parts in his possessions. Later in Watertown, a local man finds Dzhokhar hiding in his boat and calls Saunders and Superintendent William B. Evans (James Colby). Dzhokhar is quickly surrounded and arrested after a brief standoff, while crowds from the surrounding neighbourhoods cheer, and Saunders and his colleagues celebrate. The Boston police are invited to attend a Boston Red Sox game, where David Ortiz (as himself) thanks them for their heroism and tells them to ""stay strong"". Dzhokhar was sentenced to death by lethal injection and awaits his appeal in federal prison; his three college friends were arrested for obstructing the bombing investigation and authorities are continuing to seek information regarding Russell's possible involvement in the bombings. Also starring Michelle Monaghan as Carol Saunders, and Michael Beach as Governor Deval Patrick. Wahlberg, Goodman, Bacon and the other actors all do their parts fine, the explosion sequence itself is obviously the most gripping part of the film, but there are some engaging moments in the aftermath as investigators try to track down the culprits, there could have been more build up, and it could have been more thrilling more often, but overall it's not a bad drama based on a true story. Worth watching!",Patriots Day,4572514
85,sweetromantic,"Very Excellent Drama and Thriller as a Movie to watch,enjoy on weekend but contains too much propaganda",2/10,18 March 2017,"I watched this movie because it was weekend and it was categorized as Drama, Thriller & History which are my favorite ones.So I'm gonna be very honest with you, the movie is very fantastically amazing in terms of the thrills it gives you, in terms of the Dramatization and i will give it 10 out of 10 for that, but when it comes to facts, history, and real life events when one wants to go to the depth of the tragic event and learn the actual truth , then it is very biased, misleading propaganda against a group of people who follows a specific religion.First the movie shows that Muslims enslave their women, and being enslave has great rewards for the wife, it says that killing innocent people is right in Islam and for which God gives great rewards, these are utter rubbish lies, so the movie is trying to create hate against Muslims which is a very dangerous thing which is an ideology that most terrorist follows.If we spread propaganda against each other then their will be no difference between educated sane humanists and the terrorists.Spread love not Hate <3",Patriots Day,4572514

THE 2-ACTORS THEY USED TO BOOM THE PLACE I HOPE THEY ARE OK WHY? Because as ACTORS they did a hell of a JOB for that day. I do live in Canada but I remember that story. It was HORRIBLE WHY BECAUSE YOU DON'T NO WHO WAS AT THAT EVENT FOR THE DAY. I was SURPRISED that the MOVIE was even MADE. BUT I went to see it. After the MOVIE was done to see the surviving people. THE THEATER WAS SILENT I LOOKED AROUND ALOT OF TEARS. I GIVE THIS MOVIE A 10 out of 10. It was a MOVIE to see but VERY EMOTIONAL. 
IT WAS MADE BYE A GENIUS FILM MAKER. THAT MADE IT FROM HIS HEART.

87,Thanos_Alfie,The aftermath of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing...,7/10,16 March 2020,"""Patriots Day"" is an Action - Drama movie in which we follow the story of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing and the aftermath of it. We watch the manhunt of the terrorists behind this bombing and how the whole city helped the police to find the terrorists.I really liked this movie because it was based on a real-life event and it showed us what exactly happened that day and also the aftermath of it. This movie reminded me the movie of 2017 ""Stronger"" with Jake Gyllenhaal which also presented the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing but from a different perspective. The direction which was made by Peter Berg who is also one of the writers of this movie, was very good and it was obvious that he made a very good research about this event, with many interviews of the people who survived from it but also with the police officers and every person that was involved in this manhunt. Regarding the interpretations of the cast, I believe that Mark Wahlberg who played as Tommy Saunders, John Goodman who played as Commissioner Ed Davis, J.K. Simmons who played as Sergeant Jeffrey Pugliese and Kevin Bacon who played as Special Agent Richard DesLauriers were all amazing. I highly recommend everyone to watch this movie because it is a very good way of learning what exactly happened on the 2013 Boston Marathon from the inside and I also recommend you to watch the movie of 2017 ""Stronger"" with Jake Gyllenhaal.",Patriots Day,4572514

Sad that this movie is based on true events.. and more sad is when those crimes do washedup and brainwashed young people who are stupider then democratic liberals..
One of those Berg´s watchable movies instead of his supernatural ""murica heroes .. right.."" (lone survivor ikr ... ).
Go watch it if you missed it..Wahlberg is pretty normal and day to day cop here...

90,FallenEye,Raw War.,7/10,10 September 2017,"Patriots Day, though a good movie, somehow felt like it would've been better suited as a documentary, perhaps because it was shot like one, because really a documentary can be made into a movie and vice versa.This film was good all around, nothing about it was defective really. The acting and the directing was satisfactory. I find it quite surprising actually that it didn't do well at the box office... Perhaps it was too soon, and many saw it as exploitative?Also, how is it that the Dzhokhar's friends were/are arrested for obstructing justice, yet Tamerlan's wife isn't? Whatever evidence they have against the friends, it was explained in the movie that they had even more against the wife, and maybe it was circumstantial, but, how is it any different to the evidence the cops had on the friends? Unless maybe they're trying to build a case stronger than just obstruction?Lastly, how do we approach the conundrum of the ""media"", being this film, having a character who says that we're conditioned by the media to believe that 9/11 was a terrorist attack, via the very media he says is conditioning us? By accepting his media argument, we then can't believe him, but by rejecting it, we're proving his theory right. I mention this because Patriots Day is a bio, and there really still is a huge question mark around the events of September 11th.Anyway, again, Patriots Day was a good movie, and I also wonder if that friendly fire bit actually happened, because whoa; that was close. 7/10.",Patriots Day,4572514
91,RforFilm,"Patriots Day may have too much heart for it's own good, but it's still an inspiring, entertaining look at the tragic events",7/10,24 January 2017,"One question I get a lot from my family that only sees me every so often is, ""when are you gonna get married and have some children?"". The marriage question is more of a matter of finding the right person, in which only time has been a barrier. The kids question is more of a moral issue. While I would eventually like to have a little one running around, I'd just prefer to not do it in the world were currently living in. It doesn't have to do anything with politics, but rather safety. It sickens me that were forced to cope with an environment where madmen could set off catastrophic events.The past ten years have been difficult with the shootings in Orlando, Paris, and San Bernardino not to mention the constant use of excessive force from police officers putting a lot of fear over the use of guns. Things took another turn when in 2013 during the Boston Marathon, two bombs were detonated, injuring and killing several runners and bystanders. This has all been in the name of the terrorist group ISIS which remains one the nations biggest threats. The story of Boston is recounted in Patriots Day. Sergeant Tommy Saunders (played by Mark Wahlberg) was one of many police officers that were assigned to the Boston Marathon finish line. As history has revealed, two explosions ruin what was supposed to be a typical fun day for the city. Clearly never expecting such an atrocity, Boston freezes in terror while trying to make the first move to help as many of the injured as possible. Police Commissioner Ed Davis (played by John Goodman) and Mayor Thomas Menino (played by Vincent Curatola) make the decision to rule the event a terrorist attack when the first pieces of evidence are collected.In the shadows, bombers Dzhokhar and Tasmerlan Tsarnaev are making plans to set up their next target somewhere in New York City. In this process, they are trying to cover any tracks they've created, trying to get rid of any connection.The investigation quickly becomes an FBI and homeland security investigation when Special Agent Richard DesLauriers (played by Kevin Bacon) arrives to take charge. While all parties are trying to act according to plan to catch the bombers, there is clearly a feeling of intrusion with the government trying to do everything when the local police feel like they're capable of finding the culprits.What's interesting is that director Peter Berg directed another American tragedy story last year with Deepwater Horizon. Both also had actor Mark Wahlberg as the lead. The two must be good friends if both tend to continue making these kinds of movies. That is no way a bad thing, as Patriots Day is still a good movie, possibly better then Deepwater Horizon. It's biggest strength is that the movie is more focused on the investigation then it is on the tragic events. It could have been easy to put all the attention there and make it a weep-fest. Peter Berg made the decision craft the event into something cinematic in the style of several stories being told over the days unfolding after the bombing. The downside is that certain plots, like one of a father searching for his child and a couple separated by hospitals, tend to be halted in favor of the main character or the bombers. Either more time was needed to develop some of these victims or they should have gotten their own movies. I'm glad I saw this for the elements I did enjoy, like Mark Wahlberg and it's CSI-like tone.I'll give this seven Boston Marathon shoes out of ten. If not fully interesting throughout, it at least has a lot of good things that make it hard to not recommend this movie. I'll say right up that while they do show the bombers Muslim religion, it's not that offensive. This is a movie the knows it's audience; middle class Americans that'll want more of an enjoyable tribute to Boston's dedication then a psychological look into the tragedy. There's nothing wrong with that, so take it for what is is and see if you'll run with it.",Patriots Day,4572514
92,bellomona,No Reason For This Move; Watch A Documentary,1/10,25 January 2017,"I know what Wahlberg said about making the best version of a movie that was going to be made no matter what, but it's a shame. There's no reason for Hollywood to make up this story when the truth is even better. If you want to know what happened here in Boston, watch a documentary -- a few good ones have been made already. For that reason, what the movie gets right is its use of real film footage of the people and events. The real people speaking in short interviews at the end of the credits was very moving. Showing the photos of the people who died still made me start bawling. We took this bombing very personally. It may not play as emotionally in the rest of the country. What I hated about the film is Wahlberg's insistence on being the ""star"" in so many scenes (he wasn't needed, or remotely factual); how all the officials swore at each other or spoke gung-ho crap (""welcome to Watertown, motherfu**ers!"" yells a cop at the bombers); how the FBI agent was made to look like the bad guy when he was a hero. Just not necessary. Not a wonder so many victims chose not to participate. And whatever you do, please don't listen to any liars who insist this bombing didn't happen or was an inside job. America needs to wise up, alright. Ignorance hurts. Read a good book or watch a documentary about this story. It was definitely an example here of how good ALWAYS conquers evil. Love always wins.",Patriots Day,4572514

Drawn into the FBI investigation he aims to hunt down the bombers before they flee the city.
This fact-based account tells of a community's courage in the face of terror. Mark Wahlberg plays a fictional character, a composite of the courage under fire police officers, joining other courageous survivors, first responders and investigators. A strong narrative pulse drives this tense thriller and patriotism lies at the heart of the film. It doesn't stray into exploitation and resolves to full poignancy by the end.
