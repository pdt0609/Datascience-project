0,aarongnr,My personal favourite Star Wars movie.,10/10,31 October 2019,"Granted, I haven't seen the original trilogy in some time, but as of right now this is the best of ALL Star Wars movies for me.I will not go into plotpoints because many other reviews on here do that excellently, but I will rather point out why I love this one so much.And that is because in this movie you can FEEL the stakes. In this one we SEE characters we love die. We see what it took to take down the empire.Our main hero Jyn doesn't get to live. She is a part of the giant picture and a part of what ultimately ends in the emperors demise.Basically all main characters of this movie die.An this is why this movie is so good.",Rogue One,3748528
1,deepfrieddodo,The Best Star Wars Film Since The Originals,10/10,17 June 2023,"Rogue One is, by far, the best Star Wars film to be released since the original trilogy. A fantastic cast of original characters, still hitting on the popular characteristics from previous fan favourites, seek to complete a daring mission which ultimately sets up A New Hope and the whole Star Wars saga.Instead of trying to reinvent an already successful formula, this standalone story modernises the approach of the original trilogy. Dialogue is powerful and used to set up the action of a Rebellion, and characters clash to create energy on screen. Some of the best moments from the original trilogy even return in new scenarios, making an impact but not stealing attention from the plot; who doesn't want to see an AT-AT on a beach?Well tied to the canon set chronologically before and after Rogue One, links to the prequel trilogy are limited, but heavy connections are made to the Clone Wars series. Despite no focus falling on previously established characters, the plot is the perfect backstory to a significant event in the Empire's downfall.There is a great figurehead to represent the Empire, understated and without garish traits, but evil. It is a fantastic special effect to bring back Tarkin, who remains imposing, and Vader is used in perfect doses, making limited but incredibly impactful appearances. One these being one of the best finales to any Star Wars film.An aesthetic joy, the film is visually wonderful due to brilliant costume designing, props and locations. CGI is used effectively, and at no point does it seem like everything on screen has been thrown in for the sake of it, unlike the prequels. The film is visibly clean and clear cut. The score, too, fits themes excellently and really sets the tone.Without a significantly direct tie to the Skywalker Saga, cinematically, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is arguably the best Star Wars film yet.",Rogue One,3748528
2,Tweekums,An impressively dark 'Star Wars' story,10/10,10 April 2017,"Everybody who is a fan of 'Star Wars' will know that the rebels had acquired the plans to the Empire's new weapon; the Death Star this film tells the story of just how they acquired those plans and at what cost.As the film opens Imperial forces order scientist Galen Erso, who had been working as a farmer, to return to work on a new project. His wife is killed but his young daughter, Jyn, manages to escape. Fifteen years later news of the new weapon leaks out when an Imperial pilot defects while carrying a message from Galen. The pilot is held by a particularly radical rebel leader Saw Gerrera, the man who had helped save Jyn all those years ago. Jyn has lost contact with him but other rebels want her to help them get to Gerrera and learn the content of the message. Rebel officer Cassian Andor rescues Jyn from Imperial forces and they, along with K-2SO, a reprogrammed Imperial droid, go to Gerrera. By now the Empire is fully aware that a pilot has defected with a message and they will do anything to stop the rebels using that information. Jyn sees the message and learns that her father built a weakness into the Death Star but to use it the rebels will need to steal the station's blueprints from an Imperial facility. After seeing what the Death Star can do many rebels want to give up but Jyn, Cassian, K-2SO, the pilot and a few others decide that they will do what needs to be done whatever the personal cost and so a single stolen Imperial cargo ship, call sign 'Rogue One' sets off to find the plans.This is what the original prequel films should have been like. It is the darkest 'Star Wars' film to date; for once we see just how oppressive the Empire is; not just when dealing with rebels but as a brutal power of occupation. It also shows that the rebels are willing to do questionable things for what they see as the greater good of their cause. It might be thought there would be less sense of jeopardy as we've known for almost forty years that the rebels get their hands on the Death Star plans however since we haven't seen these characters before there the lingering question of why that might be is it just because they were doing other things or is it because they don't survive?! This question played on my mind throughout the film. As one would expect from a 'Star Wars' film there are plenty of exciting set pieces on a good variety of planets. The central cast are impressive; these include Felicity Jones, whose performance as Jyn I really enjoyed; Diego Luna who brings some believable ambiguity to the role of Cassian; and Alan Tudyk who provides the voice of K-2SO; one of the films best characters. The rest of the cast were pretty impressive too the only thing I was unsure about was the use of CGI to enable the late Peter Cushing to reappear as Grand Moff Tarkin and a young Carrie Fisher to appear as Princess Leia; the effects were pretty good but there was something of the 'uncanny valley' about them. There are plenty of enjoyably nods to the previous films; most notably some brief appearances from familiar characters; I also liked the nod to 'Zatoichi the blind swordsman' in the form of a blind Jedi played by Donnie Yen. I know that not everybody will like this but I really enjoyed it and would heartily recommend it to any 'Star Wars' fan.",Rogue One,3748528

5,snoozejonc,Best Disney era movie by far and one of the franchise strongest,9/10,20 December 2020,"A scientist is forcibly recruited by the Empire to help build the Death Star.In my opinion Rogue One is (to date) the best Star Wars movie produced in the Disney era and one of the strongest entries in the overall franchise. I enjoyed it for its darker tone, excellent performances and in particular how well it fits into the overarching narrative of the Star Wars universe.There are a number of memorable scenes, particularly in the final act which packs a double emotional wallop with the fate of the main characters and what we know is to come in events portrayed in the original 1977 Star Wars movie.The action sequences and visuals are fantastic throughout, with a strong combination of great cinematography, sensible computer generated imagery and effective fight choreography. It's difficult to go into detail about the best bits without major spoilers so I'll just say they get the fan service spot on with a great blend of the old and the new.All performances are solid with Felicy Jones, Diego Luna and Alan Tudyk all compelling as the main antagonists. Riz Ahmed, Mads Mikkelsen, Donnie Yen and Jiang Wen give great support. The standout performances for me are Ben Mendelsohn as a memorable villain and Forrest Whitaker in a slightly unhinged cameo.Any fans of the original trilogy should enjoy this one, particularly when compared to the prequel and sequel movies which largely miss the mark.",Rogue One,3748528

7,MOVIE-REVIEW-POOPSHOOTs,This IS Star Wars. At its best.,10/10,12 November 2019,"What has made Star Wars into the internationally recognized genre that it is today? Two things in particular - original material and a touch of humor/wit. Rogue One is a plethora of both. In addition, even in an area where previous Star Wars may have lacked (perhaps even overlooked, understandably), the acting is superb, top of the line. Forest Whitaker may be the most recognizable name in the entire cast, and he kills it every moment as his brilliant, rebellious character, Saw Gerrera. But he is merely the tip of the iceberg in what becomes an epic, near-perfectly written plot that connects episodes III and IV. It is haunting, it is funny, devastating, cheesy, and it is wonderful. It IS Star Wars.

8,AlsExGal,Goes back to Star Wars' roots,8/10,6 January 2023,"As a Star Wars fan, I was a tad bit skeptical when I heard this movie was going to be released several years ago. I was, however, pleasantly surprised. I enjoyed this film. The acting was good, the characters were interesting, and the cast was ethnically diverse.The special effects were obviously gorgeous. There were a few surprising cameos that were made possible by CGI/animation. Unfortunately, there were moments when this particular animation looked amazingly realistic, and then there were moments when the animation looked eerily fake and borderline terrifying. (no offense, Disney animators) One reviewer online wrote about how the animation may not hold up with all the technological advancements that will come about in the very near future, which to me, is understandable.The story was rather simple, but it was interesting to me how this movie apparently takes place in between Episodes 3 and 4 (AKA, Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope). The wardrobe and props were fantastic. The casting was pretty good as well. It is in my humble opinion that JJ Abrams prefers British brunettes to be his galactic leads, considering he cast Daisy Ridley as Rey in The Force Awakens and Felicity Jones (of whom I am a fan) as Jyn Erso in Rogue One. Although, this point may not be entirely accurate considering the fact that Gareth Edwards was the director of this film (but possibly Abrams had a big role in this, who knows).*Side note: This movie was 1000 times better than the disappointing prequel/sequels (Episodes 1-3, Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones, and Revenge of the Sith).",Rogue One,3748528
9,switchboard85,The Best Of The Disney-Era Star Wars Films,8/10,24 November 2019,"Without exaggeration, this is easily the best offering in the franchise since 'Return of the Jedi'. Yes, it is a spin-off of a simple set-up line from the original film, but it manages to really craft it's own story around the demands of where the plot has to go by the end. While it's definitely not a character driven movie, I was surprised with the amount of time given to our key protagonists and the effort to at least make them intriguing.The idea of another prequel movie was a hard sell; but unlike the prequel (and for that matter, the sequel) trilogy, this manages to tell it's own story within the structure of a lead-up to an event to which we already know the outcome. Felicity Jones and Diego Luna are especially effective along with secondary characters like those played by Riz Ahmed and Donnie Yen becoming easy fan favorites. Ben Mendelsohn is great as always as Krennic despite not being given much dimension as a main villain.The character of Saw Guerrera (Forest Whitaker) seems a little cut-up and while I understand the character is better informed by one of the animated series, what we have in the film seems like it may have been a little more beefed up in earlier edits of the movie.One thing I hear from people who don't care for this movie is the amount of fan-service moments. Random appearances of old characters or species, call-backs to famous lines and some easter-egg visuals can be a little distracting and if you don't care for that self-indulgent stuff, you'll definitely notice it here. Personally, it never really bothered me apart from one instance that lasts 5 seconds.On a final note, while the decision to include Darth Vader was inevitable for this movie, I was so glad to see they did a little more than give him a short cameo appearance and actually give him a moment or two without leaning on him too much as a crutch to distract the audience.If you love old Star Wars and couldn't care less about the two superfluous trilogies that followed, consider giving this a try.",Rogue One,3748528
10,jace_the_film_guy,Diamond in the Rough,9/10,24 September 2022,"Rogue One is a surprise diamond in the rough. Though the film lacks the flair (minimal lightsabers) and wit (barely any humor) of other Star Wars films, it fits the narrative being told. The cinematography is Rogue One is crisp and the dialogue is generally pretty good. The tone is serious and the characters fully embrace the severity of the situation. There are duller moments, particularly in the first two acts, but the story comes full circle in the end.I've said it before and I'll say it again, Star Wars knows how to execute killer third acts. The finale of this film is no different, and might be the best climax in the franchise other than RoTS. Everything that happens after the shield opens on Scarif is anxiety inducing. Though we have a short time to develop relationships with these characters, the connections are strong as we watch their fight for hope.Rogue One is one of those movies that did not need to be made, but I am glad that it was. I try to stray away from using the word ""perfect"" in these reviews, but this film is the perfect segue into the original trilogy.Best Character: Cassian Andor
Best Moment: The Vader slaughter.Best Quote: ""It's not a problem if you don't look up."" That was Jyn's response when asked about the Empire's rule and the Imperial flag flying. This single line adds needed depth and understanding to her character.",Rogue One,3748528
11,oriente385,So thankful for this film :) 10/10,10/10,18 January 2019,"This week I've decided to make a Star Wars' week. I watched all 8 episodes and the last two (7 and 8) left me feeling betrayed and utterly disappointed. Luckily, I still had to see this one and Han Solo film (I really don't know If I want to risk and watch the latter). Rogue One fits perfectly in the Star Wars saga, it has the feeling of grandeur, seriousness. Yes, there are some jokes but they don't make this film a farce like it happened to the 8th instalment. The main hero is a woman but she isn't annoying and she isn't a super human. Nobody is a super human, there is no place for magic and the laws of physics and the force aren't violated, as neither is viewers intelligence. The plot is simple but it delivers. The characters from older films are treated with respect. I give this film 10 stars because it is truly a Star Wars film. I was sitting on the edge of the seat and couldn't look away from the screen during the fighting scenes, they were so intense and spectacular . Thank you.

12,ingra88,Far superior to JJ & Johnson's work.,10/10,16 April 2019,"This movie brings back why we all loved Star Wars in the first place. For those who remember watching the original in the cinema long, long ago in a cinema far away....it's brings a tear to the eyes, how they recapture the classic imagination that JJ Abrams and Rian Johnson could not.
Thank you Garth Edwards, you have given back the fun where others have failed.
Johnson's 'Last Jedi' was just awfully bad.

13,kevin_robbins,Best movie of the franchise (I said what I said 😂),10/10,6 September 2023,"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016) is a Star Wars masterpiece that's in my DVD collection and I recently rewatched on Disney+. The storyline follows an orphaned young lady whose father was kidnapped by the Empire to build the Death Star. The rebellion recruits the daughter years later to find the plans that can hopefully find a weakness within the world destroyer and give them hope they can eventually overcome it.This movie is directed by Gareth Edwards (Godzilla) and stars Felicity Jones (Inferno), Diego Luna (Open Range), Donnie Yen (Ip Man), Forest Whitaker (The Last King of Scotland), Mads Mikkelsen (Casino Royale) and Alan Tudyk (I, Robot).This is the greatest Star Wars story ever told and the best movie of the franchise (I said what I said 😂). This movie is so well written with great characters, intense circumstances, tragedy, hope, humor...this movie has everything a great movie has minus the cheese the franchise is known for. The background music is intense and fit every scene to perfection. The action choreography and execution is diverse, entertaining and science fiction gold. The ending beach scene and finale is legendary, science fiction Shakespeare essentially. I adored the comedy the android brought with some clever one-liners and reactions to circumstances. The acting was fantastic and selecting Donnie Yen, Forest Whitaker and Mads Mikkelsen for the cast was brilliant.Overall, this is a science fiction genre masterpiece. I would score this a 10/10 and strongly recommend it.",Rogue One,3748528

15,dcesar13,Back to the roots,9/10,27 February 2019,"Rogue One is the movie we didn't asked for - but what we got was beyond any expectation. Excellent pacing of the movie. As the movie progresses it gets better and better. Culminates in one of the best finales seen in any of the Star Wars movies.CGI on the past main character seemed odd. But worked well on pilots and scoundrels. Many Easter eggs trough the whole movie are appreciated. Humor from Alan Tudyk's K-2SO was spot on.Empire Strikes Back is still king of the hill as the best SW movie till date. But Rogue One comes damn close near it.

16,TheLittleSongbird,A rebellion well worth saving,8/10,2 August 2017,"Loved the original 'Star Wars' films as a kid, still do. Especially 'Empire Strikes Back' while considering 'A New Hope' a genre landmark. Didn't think the prequel films were that bad personally, but they had a lot wrong with them and were a long way from great, especially 'Attack of the Clones'. Personally actually loved 'The Force Awakens', despite the vitriolic hate it's got.The latest 'Star Wars' entry, which is somewhat of a prequel, 'Rogue One' is a worthy prequel but seems to be intended as a standalone chapter and it actually fares even better in this regard. 'Rogue One' is not as good as the original trilogy, not being as much as a genre landmark or as influential but is certainly better than any of the prequel trilogy films combined and along with 'The Force Awakens' one of the better 'Star Wars' films since 'The Return of the Jedi'. With this being said, 'Rogue One' is going to be reviewed as if considered a standalone chapter.'Rogue One' has so many good things, even if the film didn't do much for me it would have gotten a 4/10 at least. For one thing, the production values (with a couple of exceptions) are amazing. Particularly good are the special effects, which are not only of outstanding and astonishingly real quality but actually drive and enhance the story and helps provide some great visual story-telling. It's wonderfully shot too, the cinematography being some of the most memorable and beautifully composed and transitioned of the year. 'Rogue One' similarly boasts a rousing, sometimes dream-like and atmospheric score from the always dependable Michael Giacchino, one misses John Williams of course and having a different composer takes some getting used to for someone who grew up with Williams' iconic themes, but Giacchino is a worthy replacement.Also impressive is a script that treats its audience with respect, rather than talking down, being bland and soulless or so dumbed down that it lacks brains. Tension, humour, action and pathos are beautifully balanced, the references and nod a delight for any 'Star Wars' fan and written in a way that is affectionate rather than shoe-horned. The story never felt dull (to me), maintaining a snappy pace and with a lot of heart and tension. There is a great combination of what made the original trilogy so great, something that Gareth Edwards fully understood, while having its own identity, this is not a re-hash yet there is an affectionate nostalgia reminiscent of the original trilogy's spirit. It makes sense, and is darker, more poignant and richer than the whole saga has been in a long time.Then there is the action, which is thrilling and has a real sense of purpose. The last forty minutes in particular are thrillingly epic. Nice to see footage of Peter Cushing and even more wonderful was seeing one of cinema's most iconic villains Darth Vader making an appearance magnificently voiced as ever by James Earl Jones.Mainly the cast are strong, with a feisty and likable heroine in Felicity Jones' Jyn, terrific support from Diego Luna and especially Riz Ahmed and Ben Mendelsohn's sterlingly played villain. The best characters are K-2SO, the wisecracking robot played with terrific comic timing and gusto by Alan Tudyk, and Chirrut, beautifully realised and 'Rogue One's' most interesting character characterised splendidly by Donnie Yen.Not without its faults by all means. Some characters are underused and underdeveloped, a few like Forrest Whittaker's (pretty wasted) Gerrera being pointless. Some of the pacing is jumpy and rushed which comes at the expense of making a cast of perhaps too many characters more consistently interesting.Design and CGI for Tarkin is ropey and distractingly artificial. While it was nice to see younger Leia again, it was cheaply recreated and like Tarkin sticks out like a sore thumb compared to the rest of the visuals, which were otherwise amazing as said.Overall, worthy prequel and a very good standalone chapter. A rebellion well worth saving. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Rogue One,3748528
17,Drawmort,An example for future Star Wars movies,8/10,26 September 2022,"Rogue One feels like a serious and grounded movie, with a plot that weighs a ton, that feels important on every scale from the very beginning and as the movie progresses it shows that it's on another level, much higher.The plot is very well written. It's simple, but direct, without fillers or unnecessary diversions. The levels of politics are reduced to the minimum so that it remains a factor to consider, but from the farthest box possible. It has impressive action sequences supported by flawless visual effects, such as the battle of Scarif, the battles of the ships and the devastating power of the Death Star. As if that were not enough, the film has cameos that have a very important presence.On the technical side, the soundtrack is very good as usual, but the sound editing also stands out tremendously. Photography is beautiful! Even from the first introductory scene of that ringed planet. The editing is also very efficient and its highest point is in the last third of the film, where there is a very fast pace as we get into the battles.The few negative points are found in specific decisions regarding the performances and the non-existent development of some secondary characters.This is a work that makes even those who most resist the fury of this old saga (like me) turn their eyes to this great action and science fiction show.",Rogue One,3748528
18,poseyfan,The futility and restlessness of war.,10/10,12 March 2023,"The third act in Rogue One might possibly be the best in all of Star Wars cinema. The space battle, the ground assault, the infiltration and the Darth Vader scene are fantastic.Andor has definitely improved this movie. Cassian's character makes more sense, and the rebellion becomes a little more real.A lot of people complain about the characters being bland, but i personally don't see it. They come across fine to me. And everybody dying at the end is the perfect finish. Not every character needs to survive. Necessary loss goes a long way; especially in a movie of this caliber.It's by no means a perfect movie though. There are some minor plot conveniences here and there in the first act, but nothing crazy.This film is underrated. I'll leave it at that.",Rogue One,3748528
19,azanti0029,Gareth Edwards has done it - The prequel story that Star Wars deserved.,10/10,13 December 2016,"With all the rumours flying about that Disney had interfered with the creative process on this one, just as when Alderaan blew up - I feared the worse. Fortunately my fears were unfounded. Rogue one is as engrossing as it is seamless and while its not perfect it had everything required to make a great movie. I guess everyone has different expectations of Star Wars. The plot which I will only briefly describe involves a group of rebels attempting to secure the plans to the Death Star, the designer of which, having a morale conscience, built the deliberate flaw (The exhaust port which Stewie Darth Vader asked about in Family Guy) so that it could be easily destroyed as long as the information fell into the right hands. This information is contained in an archive and it falls to the daughter of the designer, Jyn Erso, to not only restore her fathers name but get the designs to the rebels who are just itching to get on with events in Episode Four (New Hope) and blow the thing up.So does it hold up? Well, yes, not only does it hold up I would put this film on par with Empire and also Episode IV and this coming from someone who saw the first film on the silver screen in 1977. Gareth Edwards is a director who understands all the combined elements that make a Star Wars Film great. First a good script with the right mix of drama, action, pathos and humour and above all a story that actually makes sense, secondly good well written, rounded, characters that are interesting, diverse and unique, third great visuals - there's so many memorable shots in this film and so many of them are the shots you always wanted to see, fourth well directed action that looks and feels real, that is tense and that you can follow, fifth - tension, this film has it in spades, Sixth nods and references to the original trilogy - they come in abundance, some are comedic, some pure nostalgia while others are entirely appropriate and work so well within the story. Seventh - real sets, please give me a London Underground station redressed over bland CGI sterile sets any day of the week. Here the technology enhances the story and the tension and at no time tries to substitute for either. It is the perfect mix of live action & CG effects. I have not seen them so well combined since Lord of the Rings. This is a man who clearly understands his craft of what makes for a great film. I was highly critical of the prequel movies, which really are a masterclass in how not to make a film, here the total opposite is true. I am not a die hard Star Wars fan in any sense and was fully prepared to be very critical of this film, but find it hard to find fault in it anywhere. The supporting cast were especially good here, everyone from Riz Ahmed to Forest Whitaker giving it their all. The new villain of the piece is brilliantly played by Ben Mendelson (Hard to believe this is the kid from The Big Steal!) Donnie Yen's character was beautifully written, I could have watched another movie just about him alone. The cast feels truly international, as any universe should. Many British actors really make their mark in smaller roles including Duncan Pow & Ben Daniels as Rebel Foot Solider and General Pilot respectively while the likes of Sharon Duncan-Brewster & Jonathon Aris as Rebel Senators argue the merits of the attack in a tense conference debate - gone are the boring council meetings of the prequels. Strong drama is the key ingredient of the day. Here the Rebellion is shown as a far more tangible real faction, not everyone agrees with each other, things get messy and sometimes the wrong people are killed - the film even begs to ask the question, how better really are they than the Empire??? - we know of course, but its great to see such shades rather than just plain good and bad guys.The film contains so many pure Star Wars moments. I have no doubt the Droid (Voiced with skill by Alan Tudky) will become a favourite of many and new aliens and ship designs are not thin on the ground.Chiefly in the acting credits, plaudits must go to Felicity Jones who plays Jyn with real conviction while Diego Luna avoids a Han Solo portrayal of Cassian, her would be ally and sometimes adversary. The appearances of Vader and Tarkin (Incredible) are entirely warranted and in proportion with the rest of the film.One or two of the subplot characters are a little underwritten (perhaps deleted scenes and a longer cut will reveal them to be less so) but that really is nit picking, I had no issue with this at all. To juggle so many major and minor characters in a single narrative in a tight running time, for any director is no mean feat and Edwards manages it extremely well. I have no doubt Edwards had to steer an entire army of Executives in order to deliver the film he wanted. Perhaps one day someone will make a film about that? I have no doubt it would make for quite a story - Whatever were his obstacles, he clearly overcame them. He has done himself and every Star Wars fan proud. Pure class.",Rogue One,3748528

Many wonderful cameos. Heroism at great cost. The power of hope. This was my second viewing of many more to come. I give this film a 10 (perfect) out of 10. {SciFi Action Adventure}

21,sauravjoshi85,Rogue One is a treat for Star Wars Fans.,8/10,24 June 2023,"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (a.k.a. Rogue One) is an epic space opera film directed by Gareth Edwards. The film stars Felicity Jones, Diego Luna, Ben Mendelsohn, Donnie Yen, Mads Mikkelsen, Alan Tudyk, Riz Ahmed, Jiang Wen, and Forest Whitaker.Jyn's father is forcibly taken by the Galactic Empire to help them complete the Death Star. When she grows up, she joins a group of resistance fighters who aim to steal the Empire's blueprints.Rogue One is a stand alone film of the Star wars franchise It depicts the story of how the Rebel Alliance found the plans to the original Death Star and introduces time directly before Star Wars: A New Hope.The plot of the film is good and has a decent balance of action, comedy and a pinch of romance and is equally supported by stunning execution which will keep you engaged throughout.The engaging screenplay is beautifully supported by stunning CGI and visuals and marvelous acting.This is the type of star wars film that you want which will keep you engage thoroughly.

22,masonsaul,Best Disney Star Wars,10/10,24 September 2023,"Rogue One is the best Star Wars prequel, striking a balance between pushing this franchise forward with bold ideas and having a clear affection for what's come previously with so many easter eggs. It brings some moral greys to a universe that's usually so clear in its good & evil whilst still being about hope deep down.Felicity Jones gives a great lead performance, there's enough depth to her character with a nice arc as well. Diego Luna is so good with only a little depth, trying to make amends for a dark past and ironically, Alan Tudyk is the most human character of the group plus he's such a strong comic relief.Donnie Yen is just so cool as usual, made even better by his solid chemistry with Jiang Wen which leads to some pretty emotional moments. Ben Mendelsohn is obviously a perfect villain, using his rage in an attempt to make up for his overall lack of control and dominance.Gareth Edwards' direction here confirms that no one communicates scale like him. The Death Star and Star Destroyers have been in so many films but they're scale has never been felt like this. The handheld camera for the action really works but Edwards wisely chooses to shoot Donnie Yen's action as cleanly as possible.The CG is honestly pretty faultless, blending the practical with the CG so well and going to great lengths to make it look like models. Being the first non John Williams Star Wars score is no easy task but Michael Giacchino succeeds effortlessly, crafting something distinct that's more mournful but still sweeping and full of hope.",Rogue One,3748528
23,zardoz-13,"The Best ""Star Wars"" Saga Since ""The Empire Strikes Back!""",10/10,7 January 2017,"Nothing worthwhile comes without sacrifice, and the superlative science fiction saga ""Rogue One, A Star Wars Story"" exemplifies this notion. Basically, ""Godzilla"" director Gareth Edwards, ""Golden Compass"" scenarist Chris Weitz, and ""Bourne"" trilogy scribe Tony Gilroy have eliminated all those buffoonish, kid-friendly aliens primarily Jar-Jar Binks and given adults a chance to experience an unusually Spartan ""Star Wars"" saga. No, the PG-13 rated ""Rogue One"" is neither ""Saving Private Ryan"" nor ""Hacksaw Ridge,"" but the straightforward action will give you a reason to shed a tear since a palatable sense of doom looms over this skullduggery. Everything I've read about this entry in the ""Star Wars"" universe emphasizes the word 'stand-alone' so you won't be seeing the gifted cast, featuring Felicity Jones, Forest Whitaker, Donnie Yen, Ben Mendelsohn, and Diego Luna, reprising their roles unless Disney conjures up prequels. Of course, this doesn't apply to Darth Vader who behaves like the ruthless ruffian that he has always been. Mind you, in some respects, ""Rogue One"" may seem hopelessly predictable for some aficionados. If you've seen George Lucas' ""Star Wars: Episode VI: A New Hope,"" then you know that the Death Star didn't survive that adventurous classic. ""Rogue One"" qualifies as a prequel. Chronologically, this outing takes place between ""Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith"" (2005) and ""Star Wars: Episode VI: A New Hope."" Although we know the Death Star is ill-fated, what we didn't know the identity of the individual who sowed the seeds for its destruction. Some of the finest moments in ""Rogue One"" occur when the Grand Moff Tarkin appears. This is the infamous character that the late British actor Peter Cushing of ""Frankenstein"" fame portrayed with such ascetic villainy. Cushing's estate approved the physical recreation of the late actor's personage, and actor Guy Henry's impersonation is flawless. Quibbles aside, if Peter Cushing could see what they've accomplished, he'd be impressed. Similarly, what Edwards and his scenarists have achieved with Disney's audacious attempt to expand the ""Star Wars"" time-line is sensational. Indeed, the House of Mouse has succeeded where few film studios have ever gone with a legitimate spin-off from a multi-million-dollar franchise.Since ""Star Wars: Episode VI: A New Hope"" came out back in the summer of 1977, fans have complained about the sweet spot in the Death Star that enabled the Alliance to blow it up. ""Rogue One"" relates the story about that sweet spot, and ""Star Wars"" aficionados can argue about other things—primarily the time-line between the two films—because Luke and Leia were born at the end of ""Episode III."" Nevertheless, who really cares about such things, when a movie like ""Rogue One"" fills the gap? Aside from Darth Vader, C3PO, R2D2, and Princess Leia, the primary characters in ""Rogue One"" are entirely new to the franchise. A brilliant scientist, Galen Erso (Mads Mikkelsen of ""Dr. Strange""), has been forced against his will to collaborate with the Empire to forge the ultimate weapon of devastation. The wicked Orson Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn of ""Killing Them Softly"") has commandeered Galen for the project, and he intends to use Galen's wife Kyra (Valene Kane of ""Victor Frankenstein"") and his adolescent daughter Jyn (Beau Gadsdon) as bargaining chips. Galen sends his daughter into hiding, and Kyra perishes trying to thwart Orson. Jyn grows up under the tutelage of an extreme radical, Saw Gerrera (Forest Whitaker of ""Platoon""), and she becomes a notorious criminal who has been imprisoned when the Rebel Alliance rescues her. It seems that an Empire pilot, Bodhi Rook (Riz Ahmed of ""Nightcrawler"") has defected and given himself up to Saw. Bodhi insists that he has an urgent message from Galen Erso about the Death Star. Naturally, nobody believes the Empire could have forged such an awesome weapon. The Rebel Alliance isn't prepared to be so casual about this booger bear. Captain Cassian Andor (Diego Luna of ""Blood Father"") and his reprogrammed Empire Droid K-2so (voice of Alan Tudyk of ""Serenity"") break Jyn (Felicity Jones of ""Brideshead Revisited"") out captivity when she is being transferred to a labor camp. Later, as Jyn explains to Saw, the Rebel Alliance is using her for safe passage into Saw's camp on the planetary moon Jedha where Bodhi is being held captive. Saw surprises Jyn with a holographic message from Galen intended for her. Galen explains that the Death Star has the equivalent of an Achilles' Heel that will render it vulnerable to the Rebels. No sooner has Jyn seen this message than the Grand Moff Tarkin brings the Death Star into orbit around Jedha and unleashes its formidable power on the city. During their rushed exit from Jedha, Cassian and Jyn pick up a pair of hitchhikers, Chirrut Îmwe (Donnie Yen of ""Iron Monkey 2"") and his sidekick Base Malbus (Wen Jiang of ""Let the Bullets Fly""), who become recruits for the cause. Chirrut is a blind martial arts warrior who wields a lethal staff and believes in the Force with all his heart.""Rogue One, A Star Wars Story"" depicts the efforts of the underdog Rebel Alliance to triumph over the Empire. Basically, this exciting escapade works on the level of a Republic Serial from the 1940s with one cliffhanger scene after another ensuing in a grand finale on a scenic Caribbean-like island named Scarif where the star fleets of the both the Rebel Alliance and the Empire wage the battle to end all battles. Although it doesn't rely on the usual troika of Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, and Princess Leia, ""Rogue One"" imitates ""Star Wars"" in virtually every respect except its ending with a Pyrrhic Victory. Felicity Jones makes a sympathetic heroine that you won't forget. Donnie Yen and Alan Tudyk as K-2SO compete as the ultimate scene stealers. The special effects are stellar stuff. Altogether, ""Rogue One"" qualifies as the best ""Star Wars"" epic since ""The Empire Strikes Back.""",Rogue One,3748528
24,j_forbesy,Rogue One Review,9/10,14 December 2016,"Rogue One is the first Star Wars film to be set outside the Episodic Sagas. With that, there was a lot of pressure on it to perform and launch this new series of Star Wars films.By far, this is the least kid friendly film. This was at it's core, a war film, something we have never really gotten in the Star Wars universe. With the war theme we got an overall darker tone than we are use to, and it really suited the story they were telling. We never have experienced the war side of Star Wars because the stories have always been focused on a force user rather than the events around them. Because there are no jedi, we got to see more of the Rebellion and the Empire and the battle that is taking place during the original trilogy.Offsetting the darker tone of the film, I thought this was perhaps the funniest Star Wars film. There are so many one liners and comedic moments that brings a lighter tone to the darker moments. I think much of the comedic moments came from the droid character K2SO. For the most part, he was the comedic relief and because of that, you are drawn to his character and is a stand out.While still on the cast and characters, I thought they were near perfect. While the characters themselves aren't as fleshed out as we get during the saga films, for the role themselves, they served their purpose. Apart from K2SO, I thought Donnie Yen's character, Chirrut was a close second standout. I really enjoyed his character because of his connection into the Star Wars law.How much you enjoy Rogue One is, for the most part, going to depend how deep you invested you are into the world of Star Wars. As someone who read Cataylst in the lead up to Rogue One, I felt as though my experience during this film was enhanced so much. There were so many moments that was so much meaningful and heartfelt because I knew the backstory to some of these events and characters. There is also a lot fan service in Rogue One that on paper, it seems like it's too much. But what stood out was that not one of the fan services felt shoed in. All of it felt like it had a place in the movie and should of been there regardless of if it was a fan service moment or not.Walking out of this film, you are going to be on a high and that is because of the fantastic third act this film has. Rogue One has a third act that will rival that of Return of the Jedi. This is one of the best space battle I have ever seen. While I love the one in Return of the Jedi, personally I rank the opening battle from Revenge of the Sith above it. However, the space battle in Rogue One beats them all. It had the feel that Return of the Jedi brought in their space battle but with the action and visual effects the space battle in Revenge of the Sith.Stepping back from the space battle, the third act has a terrific ground level fight. This was where the war tone was heavily present. This was a scene we see in a WWII war film but with a Star Wars skin. There's no better way to describe it, and that is a good thing. What really enhanced the war toned ground fight was how well it was edited between the action happening on the ground and the spectacle of a space battle happening above them.I have to mention Vader. While he isn't in it all that much, when he is, his presence is felt. Without giving so much away, his final scene is perhaps one of my favourite scenes I have ever seen. The short scene alone rivals the Airport scene in Captain America: Civil War for me. It is so exciting that it has the capability to make any major Star Wars fans cry with happiness.Overall, I loved this movie. This did what it need to do and prove that they can make Star Wars films that isn't all lightsabers and Skywalkers. But what this film does the best is enhance A New Hope. As soon as I walked out the cinema I wanted to go and watch A New Hope. Personally, I really struggle with watching A New Hope but with Rogue One it makes me excited to go back and watch the original Star Wars.9/10",Rogue One,3748528

27,eve_dolluk,Great Prequel to New Hope,8/10,14 December 2016,"I've just returned from the midnight showing of Rogue One here in the UK. I was slightly sceptical after watching Force Awakens, while enjoyed FA it did lack teeth and flesh.Rogue one was a great prequel to New Hope.We know that Princess Leigh had the death star plans but how did she get them ??.Well now we know.A few minutes into the film I felt disappointed that there was no Star Wars theme or rolling credits. Once I got past this the film started coming to life and put you right into the star wars universe. There were nudges to the originals everywhere, old characters from New Hope were brought to live to return to the big screen.There was plenty of visual eye candy here and a climactic ending that was truly stunning. I want to watch it again to see all the little details.This is a dark and emotional film compared to others but it has its light hearted moments also.Without giving too much away we follow a rag tag bunch fighting against the Empire and Lord Vader. A lost girl, a rebel agent, a defector, a novice trainee of the force, a hot shot gunner and a reprogrammed imperial robot. Alongside the rebel alliance they discover the existence of the Empires latest super weapon and must a find a way to destroy it. The Bad - 1.Some of the dialogue is wooden but this goes for all Star Wars film. 2. There is a lull in action about midway through and the dark scenes at this point may bore some people.3. No JediThe Good - 1. Amazing climactic ending a real visual treat.2. Ties in really well to New Hope.3. Interesting characters not your typical heroes which makes them more interesting.4. I got emotional at the end xIf your a fan of the originals then don't miss this film. My Star Wars marathon just got better ( and bigger )8/10 xx",Rogue One,3748528
28,adamjohns-42575,The Rebellion was built on THIS!,10/10,8 April 2023,"Rogue One (2016) -I love this film! I know so many people that don't like it or don't see the point of it, but I think that it was almost as good as the original trilogy.I believe that it was a love letter to the fans. A tribute to all of the nerds that really love the franchise and know who all the characters are, the ones that have read every book and even all of the comics, as well as the volumes that contain specs for each of the vehicles and backstory's for all of the characters. I'm not quite that obsessed, although I probably would be if I could, but it was so great to see so many fantastic nods to the other films/TV series in this one and some moments that were worth watching the film just to see, things that made me gasp and my jaw drop upon the first viewing. It was clearly made by fans of the franchise, was exactly what it needed and held true to the style of George Lucas.With all of that said, I'm not actually a fan of Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) or Cassian (Diego Luna) and having seen 'Andor' (2023-) I didn't feel that series had added anything to his character or explained the chip on his shoulder, that was still obvious, watching this film afterwards. Although it did set up some great character arcs for Mon Mothma (Genevieve O'Reilly) and Saw Gerrera (Forest Whitaker), key characters in this film.I also don't like Ben Mendelsohn as an actor either, but I suppose that helped to make him a decent bad guy in the role of Director Krennic. I certainly wanted him to get his comeuppance.None of that made a difference to how much I enjoyed this film though, because everything else was so spot on - the soundtrack, the filming, the action and the lighting and all of the supporting artists.K-2S0 (Alan Tudyk) was brilliant for comic relief and Chirrut (Donnie Yen) and Baze (Wen Jiang) were awesome additions to the Star Wars Universe.There was a great use of well known and existing characters too, either in full or as cameos, including some surprises due to CGI and other special effects.And actually the CGI was absolutely brilliant as well as the use of older footage from 1977, polished up and recycled. The care and thought that had gone in to every detail, including costume, props and locations was glaringly obvious. Nothing about this film was half arsed.The finale was absolutely awesome, so unexpected the first time around and it still gives me goosebumps when I rewatch it.Overall it managed to maintain the ideals and values of the original trilogy, whilst also managing to bring it up to date, although the franchise has never really been known for being backwards.It also tied in with the extended universe
following on perfectly from 'Revenge Of The Sith' (2005) and incorporating elements of 'The Clone Wars' (2008-20).To the nay sayers I reply that you are wrong. This was a superb and very valid part of the larger story, possibly more connected than some of the others in 'The Skywalker Saga'.959.09/1000.",Rogue One,3748528

31,mungflesh,"At last - a decent, new Stars Wars movie",9/10,28 December 2016,"What a return to form for Star Wars! I've seen this twice already and the second time was pretty much as exhilarating at the first. It's not just 'not crap' - it's actually great, and the first time in a while I didn't want a movie to end.I won't go into the story details. Star Wars fans should know what this is about and those who aren't fans are a bit hopeful by this point in time if they think watching the latest one will change their minds. Those who are somewhere in between are more likely to enjoy this than the prequels.Episode 7 had promise but Abrams' movie fell short. He fixed the issues that everyone had been griping about since the prequels, except that he brought a bunch of new ones instead (like too much pop culture and forced attempts at comic relief).Rogue 1 is really well written. There's such a huge difference between this and the prequels, or Episode 7. The story manages to stay interesting and coherent throughout, without glaring contradictions to itself or the rest of the franchise. The characters become interesting quickly, and you do end up giving a damn about them by the end of the film.Like kids in candy stores, Lucas and Abrams both made these movies with too much new technology at their disposals and too many potential ideas flying around; restraint was required on both their parts. Gareth Edwards, on the other hand has managed to get the ingredients right and, dare I say it, takes the franchise to a few new places.Rogue 1 is not the powerhouse of a movie that The Empire Strikes Back is but it does offer, ironically, A New Hope for the Star Wars universe.",Rogue One,3748528

But that really show how I feel about this movie. I want to see the next one!This movie make us realized that Star Wars can be expanded in many ways. You don't have to rely on the force, jedi, or lightsaber to make it good. You can focus on something else.Rogue One feels like a proper war movie. Something that can be happened here, not just in galaxy far away. There's espionage, betrayal, politics, drama, the victims, and the actual war.The story is good, the cinematography is great, the acting is superb, decent amount of jokes, the music lives up the atmosphere. If I have to complaint it's that they jump from place to place (planets to be precise) too often, sometime it's confusing. But other than that this movie is super.In my opinion this is the best Star Wars movie after the original trilogy. After the betrayal they give to fans in serie 7-9, only this movie and The Mandalorian that make fans satisfied.",Rogue One,3748528

So Empire Strikes Back is 'THE' Star Wars movie and the original is, well, undeniably original but Rogue One is Star Wars for a modern audience. It 'looks', 'feels' and 'sounds' like Star Wars but isn't silly and doesn't subvert the tropes of the universe whilst telling a proper story that actually supports the larger arc. It has enough 'fan service' to scratch that itch but brings plenty to the saga without derailing it or undermining its power, story or characters.Easily the high point of anything Star Wars beyond the original trilogy. Such a shame this wasn't the mould/ tone of the prequels, sequels and spin-offs.

35,Padrion,The only modern Star Wars movie you need to watch,9/10,12 April 2023,"Rogue One is an anomaly, an exception to the rule. After a mediocre prequel trilogy and a very unoriginal sequel with the force awakens this came out of nowhere and felt fresh yet familiar at the same time. It proved that was still possible to tell exciting stories in this forty years old sci-fi universe.Darker and grittier in tone, putting more emphasis on ""war"" than on ""star"", it might not be every fan's cup of tea but it was made with the deepest respect towards the existing universe. Accordingly it succeeds to enrich it instead of just plundering it for quick cash. Watching Rogue One makes re-watching the original trilogy even better.The movie isn't quite perfect, though as the exposition is rather long and confusing and some cgi-ressurrected actors are quite deep in uncanny valley. But these are minor flaws in this action packed, deeply emotional story about hope and sacrifices.

In a short time period right before the events of A New Hope , we find ourselves in the middle of a galactic war between the Rebel Alliance and the Empire .The synopsis of this film starts in the entire opening crawl with the traditional text from Star wars (1977) : A long time ago in a Galaxy far , far away . It is a period of civil war with rebel spaceships....but instantly leaps to the action . No long opening crawl . In fact , this film is set days before the events of Star wars . It follows the outcast Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) and how she came to join the Rebel Alliance in a dangerous move to steal the Death Star plans . Her kidnapped dad Galen (Mads Mikkelsen) has built a terrifying super-weapon : The Death Star that contains kyber crystals and revealed to be used as fuel for it , it is a battle station capable of destroying an entire planet . With a desperate goal of saving her daddy from the Empire and retrieving the secret plans for the weapon of mass destruction : The Death Star, we follow a group of rebel spies (Felicity Jones , Diego Luna as Cassian Andor , Donnie Yen as Chirrut Îmwe , Wen Jiang as Baze Malbus , Riz Ahmed as Bodhi Rook) and including the ordinary robot : K-2SO (voice : Alan Tudyk) , an Imperial enforcer droid who's been re-purposed to work for the rebellion. All of them have hope to restore peace to the Galaxy , being commanded by the high staff (Jimmy Smits as Bail Organa , Fares Fares as Senator Vaspar , Alistair Petrie as General Draven , Genevieve O'Reilly as Mon Mothma , Ben Daniels as General Merrick , Ian McElhinney as General Dodonna) and to vanquish Orson Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn) and other empire enemies as well as eliminate the destructive super-weapon or it will be too late . A risky rebellion built on hope . Save the Rebellion. Save the dream.Delightful follow-up to the trilogy that George Lucas always said was intented to be for children . However , because of its imagination , scale , spectacularity , and style , it results to be a fabulous entertainment for all ; both , kiddies and adults . Interesting and engaging screenplay by Chris Weitz , Tony Gilroy from a story by John Knoll , and based on characters created by George Lucas . And being the first Stars Wars franchise to introduce location on-screen caption . Some marvellous new creations , especially state-of-art robots , and the unbeatable special effects more than make up for a slighly overlong movie . Although it is more a spin-off than a sequel , it is more different and original than its predecessors ; if it's no less enjoyable or uplifting . To wonder at the way in which heroes and heroines steer their aircrafts and fall off in high-speed against the large enemy crafts . And the breathtaking dogfighting and overwhelming piloting at the end restore it to the realm of super-spectacle to which it belongs . Felicity Jones is acceptable as Jyn Erso joining the Alliance, Jyn finds herself in the middle of the ultimate conflict between the Rebels and the Empire as well as to cripple a super-weapon . She is well accompanied by an enjoyable support cast , such as : Forest Whitaker , Riz Ahmed , Mads Mikkelsen , Jimmy Smits ,Genevieve O'Reilly and many others . Tarkin, portrayed by Peter Cushing in Star wars is now played by Guy Henry with a CGI replica of Cushing's face superimposed over his . And special appearance by Darth Vader , voice: James Earl Jones, who is meticulously patterned after his look in the original ""Star Wars"". And Carrie Fisher-CGI Leia (Ingvild Deila, voice: Carrie Fisher) who is asked what the plans mean and she answers , ""Hope,"" signaling the start of the first Star Wars film... Star Wars (1977) . However , Carrie Fisher (Princess Leia), Kenny Baker (R2-D2), and Drewe Henley (Red Leader) all passed away in 2016.It displays an attractive production design , over-the-top scenarios , appropriate photography and adequate costuming , as costume designer David Crossman stated that some of the original costumes used in Star wars (1977), The empire strikes back (1980) and The return of the Jedi (1983) were reused here . It packs colorful and evocative cinematography by Greig Fraser And rousing musical score from Michael Giacchino , taking parts of original soundtrack by the classy John Williams ; Michael has composed every film directed by J.J. Abrams except Star wars episode VII , though composer Alexandre Desplat's original score was rejected . Michael Giacchino, his replacement, had only one month to write his musical score. The motion picture was well directed by Gareth Edwards who exposed their three of his influences for film-making are George Lucas, Steven Spielberg and Quentin Tarantino. He has made succesful films , as the hit of ""Monsters"" resulted in Edwards getting offers from the major studios, especially Warner Bros., who tapped him to direct an English-language reboot of the 1954 Japanese classic ""Gojira"", being produced by Warner Bros and Legendary Pictures, directing the successful ""Godzilla¨ . Finally directed this ¨Rogue one¨, a tremendous box office hit smash , grossing a lot of money worldwide .",Rogue One,3748528
37,tim-Chinchen,5 years on and worth a rewatch!,10/10,24 December 2021,"An amazing film and really benefits from a rewatch 5 years after it's release, whilst we're now spoilt as Disney finds its feet with Madalorian, Book of Bobba, etc - we're reminded how to use the Star Wars universe and its potential to best effect! The characters shine in this, when you remove all the fan service - it's a great and gritty war film - just what a lot of us who grew up with Star Wars want (specifically ""Empire fans"".There's some great dialog in there - ""Do you want to live your life under the flag of the Empire? / It's fine if you don't look up""Magnificent film - Love it!!!

38,cristianocoppola,The greatest Star Wars movie after the original trilogy,10/10,15 April 2023,"Wonderfully it captures the spirit, tone and immense universe of the trilogy with being original and fitting perfectly into the original lore and canon, every single character has meaning and purpose and every death on screen is felt like a lightsaber slash, rebels and imperials alike. Why on earth the other Star Wars movies cannot have been written like this one??? What a shameful waste. Why all the hate and ridicule imposed on beloved characters? I loved the very strong leads regardless of gender and identity, multiculturalism is still there to reflect the universal scope of the many races portrayed on screen. Watch it and watch it again to remind yourself what a wonderful experience is Star Wars. And forget what garbage is being vomited these days.

39,nicolasbarham,Great way to start off the star wars spin off movies,8/10,25 May 2018,"I have watched this movie 2 times already and can say that I really enjoyed it. This movie takes a little time to get going, but once it gets going boy does it impress. The second half of this movie was brilliant and was on the edge of my seat to the very end. I respect Gareth Edwards for some of the choices made in the end of the movie which mainly landed. One of the bigger issues with this movie is the pacing of the movie as I have said that the first half of this movie is very slow but eventually gets going and thats why really I really it up to and 8/10 for me. So I would definitely recommend it, and check it out immediately.

41,Hey_Sweden,The Force is with me. I am one with The Force.,7/10,11 August 2017,"""Rogue One"" functions as a bridge between Episodes III and IV in this ongoing ""Star Wars"" film series, telling the story of the ambitious plot to obtain the plans to the armored space station The Death Star and hopefully find a weakness. A character named Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) is recruited by The Rebel Alliance because it was her father Galen (Mads Mikkelsen) who helped to design the damn thing. Even after Jyn learns from a hologram of her father that it does in fact have a weakness (that he deliberately contrived), the RA won't lift a finger to help her. So she goes ""rogue"" with various soldiers, a Rebel spy (Diego Luna), a smart alecky droid (voice of Alan Tudyk), and an Imperial defector (Riz Ahmed).While it is true that the script isn't without flaws, ""Rogue One"" is a spirited enough adventure. We don't really get to know characters that well, but they possess a basic inherent rooting factor that does help. Director Gareth Edwards handles the scope of the material quite well, and this viewer, for one, didn't feel that his pacing was too sluggish. The expected abundance of CGI was actually fairly impressive, for the most part. The action steadily builds towards an ultimately large scale battle in space that is satisfying.Best of all, it's nice to see Darth Vader in full bad ass evil villain mode, even if his screen time is limited. Governor Tarkin is also brought back, using the digitized rendering of the image of the late Peter Cushing, and this effect turns out better than expected, if not perfect. Various nods are made to characters and details from Episode IV, such as those characters who pick a fight with Luke in the cantina.It really does throw you off at first, not hearing that familiar, majestic John Williams theme OR seeing an expository crawl at the beginning. (The score by Michael Giacchino isn't bad at all but it's nowhere near as memorable as anything Williams composed.) Fortunately, once the story kicks in, this becomes a solidly entertaining viewing experience.The performances from the international cast are decent. Tudyk is amusing as a droid who doesn't ACT much like a droid; he has a sardonic, sarcastic personality. Forest Whitaker is over the top as an extremist character who really doesn't serve much of a purpose.All in all, ""Rogue One"" shows the audience a fairly good time, right up until its conclusion designed to lead right into the opening of Episode IV.Seven out of 10.",Rogue One,3748528
42,claudio_carvalho,A Prequel to the 1977 Star Wars,7/10,20 March 2017,"""Rogue One"" is a prequel to the 1977 ""Star Wars"", disclosing how the rebel Princess Leia Organa gets the plans of the powerful Empire's Station Death Star that rebels from the Rebel Alliance have stolen; later she would hide them in the memory of R2-D2. The plot is unoriginal and predictable but highly entertaining for fans of the saga of the exhausted franchise. The cute Felicity Jones performs a character that could have been interesting in the rest of the saga. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil):""Rogue One: Uma História Star Wars"" (""Rogue One: Star Wars Story"")

43,Commander_Tomalak,The only modern Star Wars you should see.,9/10,26 September 2022,"With all its flaws this is the best (and only) Star Wars since the original trilogy.It adds to Star Wars a layer of realism never seen before.The Empire as portrayed as a brutal, fanatical / fascist power in the hands of ambitious and unscrupulous leaders capable of anything / everything. In contrast, the Rebellion is a desperate insurgency group, with their back against wall, forced to the extremes just for its survival.My favorite quotes from the movie:""Rebellions are built on hope.""""We will take the next chance and the next, until we win or the chances are spent."".""May the force be with us""",Rogue One,3748528
44,briancham1994,Better than the sequel trilogy,7/10,1 June 2020,"The other recent Star Wars films were a little disappointing but this one lived up to expectations. It has excellent characters, story and battles. The filmmakers put a lot of effort into the settings and they all look like believable locations. It was gripping and tense all the way through.

45,pdrseuss,A Surprise Addition to the Classic Trilogy,9/10,1 January 2019,"This is probably my 2nd favorite Star Wars movie. (My favorite will be revealed shortly.) The team that wrote, directed, and scored this film should do all of the future movies. Not since The Phantom Menace have I seen a movie worthy to be called a Star Wars film. (The other 2 prequel movies were cool, but I consider them Palpatine's story. And rightly so, as Palpatine is probably one of cinema's greatest villains.) Rogue One could have been a true fiasco by riding on the strands of story about the capturing of the Death Star plans, and if it was made any later, it would have been probably considered ""yet another Death Star film"". But Rogue One had character, characters, heart, dialogue, grit, and pacing just as much as the original/classic trilogy had, and I feel is a welcome addition to be embraced. It truly made you cheer for the rebel alliance, and weep for their sacrifices against the fearsome Empire.My favorite Star Wars film is The Empire Strikes Back.",Rogue One,3748528
46,mcummings-89092,By far the best Star Wars movie since the original trilogy,9/10,17 November 2022,"Upon my first watch I wasn't totally sure about Rogue One, but every time I watch it since my view becomes more positive. That's especially true when compared to the CGI over reliant prequels and the disaster sequels and the frankly woeful Solo.This actually has a solid script which ties in nicely to the other films (unlike Solo where there is no consistency), it's extremely well acted, balances the tension of the story, which is darker in tone the most films in the universe. The two leads Felicity Jones and Diego Lima were little known at the time but are amazing in every sense. The supporting cast are all great too without the need to childish humour or dumbing down. You realise they are in a fight for survival for different reasons and willing to do what ever it takes to succeed.The film ends perfectly but you have a bitter sweet feeling.

47,mjpiro,The Star Wars Movie We Never Knew We Needed!!,8/10,26 February 2023,"Rogue One is the best Star Wars stand alone movie to date!! It gave both A New Hope, and therefore the entire Star Wars movie saga, a shot in the arm by addressing one plot flaw that even legendary writer/director George Lucas missed when writing his groundbreaking Star Wars treatment back in the 1970's. That simple mistake, & the McGuffin or idea hat drives Rogue One, is how could something so powerful, something so expensive, something that took so much time and so many people and lives to make as the the super battle station the Death Star be defeated by a simple proton shot by a small X-Wing fighter flown by a dust cropper farm boy. Of course we learn through the movie there were inside men on the job and a team that stole the plans to the Death Star that eventually allowed that farm boy to destroy one of the most powerful weapons in all of the Star Wars universe!! Fresh new characters led by Felicity Jones as Jen Erso and Diego Luna as Cassian Andor bring new energy to the Star Wars universe and add gritty and realistic acting styles to Rogue One that take you back to the original trilogy only in a more desperate time!! Filled with moments that will take you back to the original trilogy (the gas giant planet Yavin, REAL Stormtroopers, the REAL Darth Vader in a scene that will blow your mind and is something out of your dreams - or nightmares) Rogue One is one of the most important and most well done Star Wars movies out there!! Good action, good costuming, very good acting, good sound editing, good soundtrack, excellent writing and directing make this movie both fun and something that has consequence for Star Wars fans!! 8 out of 10 stars!!",Rogue One,3748528
48,xpunisherx,My favorite Star Wars movie,9/10,22 December 2019,"I'm not a crazy fan of Star Wars and honestly think it's overrated. This movie is one of my favorites though. It's just normal people without a single lightsaber banding together to pull off a huge feat. The main actress is amazing and Donnie Yen has always been my favorite martial artist. It's a must watch, even if you don't like Star Wars.

49,mhorg2018,A Great Stand Alone,10/10,1 August 2018,"Forget the naysayers. This movie, based on one paragraph in a new hope's crawl, is absolutely great. Yes, I know they had a female hero. So what? This shows the answer to the Rebel Spaceships, striking from a hidden base. How did those plans get nabbed? Who did they go to? The final battle over Scarif, as well as showing just how really relentless and evil the Empire is, as well as Vaders appearance at the end made this an instant classic. Just an excellent movie.

50,RocketeerFlyer,Rogue One is the 'EMPIRE' of all the other Star Wars films,9/10,25 September 2022,"Gareth Edwards shouldn't he have already been signed up for future Star Wars films by now?I rate J. J. Abrams & his reinvention of the Star Trek films worked (for me), but if i may be so bold, he perhaps should have stayed within the Trek Universe rather than move over to the Star Wars one.I'm not a hater of SWTFA, in fact I rather enjoyed it but after all that has been said & done regarding that filmit was basically a rehash of the original A New Hope (to some degree) if we are being honest but it got things safely back on screens...This film
""ROGUE ONE"" is something else.It's the ""Empire Strikes Back"" of all the other Star Wars films that have followed 'The Return of the Jedi'It is the film I have re-watched over & over again more than any of these others that came after Jedi.How this guy (Gareth Edwards) has not been put in charge again of another Star Wars film is beyond me, like many others here reviewing this film we know this is damn well nearly PERFECT.I shall whisper this quietly but for my money it is the 3rd Best film in the entire Star Wars saga & even then ONLY JUST and at times I do even feel it deserves to be right up there with the Original Star Wars film & it's fantastic sequel EMPIRE.This was director Gareth Edwards last cinema release film!!!How very, very strange & then one learns that this film ranks as one of only 50 films to ever make it past the ONE BILLION DOLLARS mark (said in a Dr Evil voice of course) perhaps it was Gareth's choice?I noticed his next film is due for release next year (some 7 years after Rogue One) called ""True Love"" which seems to be a sci-fi love story.Best of Luck with this one Gareth, but what in the world happened here?Most Star Wars fans have a real LOVE for what he created here, the atmosphere, the direction, the story, the acting, he's a special effects guy (a good one too) and he probably even had a hand in those too? Yet he seems to have been shunned after this film was released despite it becoming somewhat of 'cult' classic already.A cult classic that became one of the TOP 40 movie money makers of ALL TIME if we can have such a thing? Well, if we can? Then this is it.Let's show some LOVE for Mr Gareth Edwards who really did bring STAR WARS back to something akin to those originals we so fondly remembered.The folks at Disney could create much good will if they got him back in the director's chair...can you image COMIC CON & Gareth back as director of a Star Wars film? The one's who know would GO CRAZY!So a BIG THANK-YOU to you Gareth, along with the cast & crew & everyone else involved in this terrific Star Wars film & for giving us what is a very re-watchable & enjoyable film with that killer ending :(
Sad but satisfying & then we got that end scene!LOVE IT.",Rogue One,3748528
51,nickenchuggets,Far above the other recent Star Wars movies,8/10,2 July 2021,"It might be difficult for some fans to accept, but even such a monumental franchise as Star Wars eventually degrades and gets worse after a while. This is not surprising because it happens to basically every show or movie series that continues for too long. For this exact reason, I held off on watching The Force Awakens until 2019, when it was already 4 years old. I simply didn't want to watch it after reading page after page of negative reviews, with people saying how it essentially killed the authenticity of the series. Every once in a while though, a new movie comes out to remind us that all hope is not lost, and this is surely the case with Rogue One. Going into this movie for the first time not knowing anything about it, I did not really have high expectations. After all, most people seem to hate the newer movies (even the prequels that were made in the early 2000s, way before this one). After watching it though, I can now say that is it quite impressive and I was surprised. In my view, it redeems all the other mediocre Star Wars movies released in the last 6 or so years. The reason why I think this movie is way better than the other recent Star Wars films in simply because it goes back to where it started, and by that I mean it literally takes place a week or so before the events of the first one that was made. The story is centered on a young girl named Jyn Erso whose father had a very big role in developing the Death Star, a huge space station that the Imperials use to annihilate whole planets. A weapons designer visits him on his homeworld one day and orders him to continue developing the space station, which leads to Jyn (very young at this time) hiding until Krennic (the Imperial) leaves. Somewhat jarringly, the movie then skips ahead to over a decade into the future, and Jyn is now grown up. She eventually involves herself in a journey to a moon called Jedha, and while there she (along with a defected Imperial droid and her friend Cassian) learn that the imperials are excavating a holy city for things called Kyber crystals to power the Death Star's superlaser. A violent confrontation happens between Jyn's team and the imperials, and shortly after, she is able to view a sentimental recording of her father in which he explains the Death Star's only weakness. However, unbeknownst to the people on the moon below, the Death Star (under Krennic's control) fires its laser at the holy city, vaporizing it instantly. Jyn and her friends manage to get away using a spaceship, and they fly to another planet where she is finally reunited with her father. He is killed when Rebel starfighters bomb the compound he is hiding in. While all this is going on, one would think the imperials are happy since Krennic used the Death Star to blow up a city as a show of dominance, but Vader isn't. He threatens Krennic and orders him not to do something so rash ever again. Later, Jyn and her squad are determined to steal the plans for the Death star and provide it to the Rebels in order to give them a fighting chance against it, but it isn't going to be easy. A stolen imperial ship (called Rogue One) takes them to the planet that Krennic has his base on, and Jyn's task is to somehow get inside and find the plans. Above the planet, the vast expanse of space explodes in a huge battle between rebel and imperial starships. Most of Jyn's allies meanwhile are killed during her infiltration of the base. Eventually after much bloodshed she's able to retrieve the plans and upload them to the rebel ships after a star destroyer crashes on top of the shield generator blocking the signal, disabling it. Her main task completed, it looks as if Jyn will live to fight another day, but the Death Star appears and once again uses its laser to destroy the ruined base. Jyn dies, along with everybody else in a huge radius surrounding the facility. At the end of the movie, Vader tries to chase the escaping rebel ships and retrieve the Death Star plans, which is what you see in the beginning of the first Star Wars movie. I have to admit, this movie is way better than the other recent ones. It explains in detail what happened shortly before the events of the first film, because up to this point, nobody really did. The start of episode IV alludes to a victory the rebels won over the imperials, but they never actually say what it is. Now we can completely understand why the first movie is called ""A New Hope."" In spite of this movie's well done story, special effects, acting, and everything else, there are some things I don't like. It's a common criticism of this movie, but I didn't like how Grand Moff Tarkin makes an appearance in several scenes that take place on the Death Star. This is because in the first movie, Tarkin is played by Peter Cushing. Obviously by 2016 Cushing was dead, but because the film is set at roughly the same time as episode IV, it wouldn't have made sense to use another actor. This means Cushing does appear in the movie, but he's just a digital image that was made inside a computer. It still looks good, but when the CGI is shown next to live actors, it's so clear that it isn't real. Still, it is a good attempt to connect it with the first movie. The special effects are quite good, especially during the space battle scenes, which really isn't a surprise for something like Star Wars. There's even some comic relief in the movie too, since the film makers understand the importance of funny moments when everything else going on is gunfire and killing. The cast of the movie was clearly carefully chosen in order to make things more believable. Felicity Jones as Jyn has become a very important part of Star Wars lore, because back in the 70s, we were not really told how the rebels were able to get the Death Star plans. Now we know. Probably one of the best characters is Chirrut Imwe, who is blind, but simply has no need for vision because of the immense trust he has in the Force. At the end of the day, I can easily tell everyone that Rogue One is probably the best recent Star Wars movie. Most people seem to hate Force Awakens, Solo, and especially Rise of Skywalker, but this one easily trumps them all because it explains what happened shortly before the first movie and makes everything come full circle.",Rogue One,3748528
52,SPZMaxinema,The only Star Wars that Disney did justice with!!!,9/10,23 August 2021,"While the first half or third of the movie is a bit meh and exposition-heavy, the last act is pure Star Wars entertainment and fun. Easter eggs and callbacks/references work, the special effects/CGI are mostly on point, and the new characters that come along are likable and kick butt! The force is with this film!

53,SnoopyStyle,terrific fan service,8/10,16 December 2016,"Weapons designer Galen Erso (Mads Mikkelsen) is hiding from the empire with his wife and daughter. He is captured by Orson Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn) who kills his wife and forces him to work on the Death Star. Saw Gerrera (Forest Whitaker) rescues and raises Galen's daughter Jyn. Years later, Saw has become an extremist and Jyn (Felicity Jones) is in Imperial prison. Galen convinces cargo pilot Bodhi Rook (Riz Ahmed) to defect and seek out Saw with a message. Cassian Andor (Diego Luna) with droid K-2SO (Alan Tudyk) from the rebel alliance rescues Jyn. They are sent to find Saw and the pilot defector. The ragtag group is joined by Chirrut Îmwe (Donnie Yen) and Baze Malbus (Wen Jiang) as the empire completes its secret ultimate weapon.This is a fan service war movie coming from director Gareth Edwards. I don't know why fan service has such a bad reputation. It's definitely better than fan disservice. This should satisfy any fans of episode four. There are solid actors doing good acting. Mendelsohn does a great job and Felicity Jones is a good lead. K-2SO is probably the best new character. There is an international cast with corresponding accents which will probably annoy certain people. It doesn't bother me but I expect snarky internet comments. The CGI characters recreation is a great idea looking for better execution. The movie does miss the opening crawl. The start feels abrupt without it. There are a couple of dialog speeches that get a little long. Despite the little hiccups, there is plenty of action and an epic third act which should be fun for any fan of the franchise.",Rogue One,3748528
54,timquitzau,Best ever spin off,10/10,28 July 2023,Pre Star Wars A New Hope and the best ever spin off ever made in my opinion and I am writing this in 2023.Has everything and stays true to the whole story and concept of the universe.A sad story but kind of necessary to stay true to A New Hope and with a couple of pleasant surprises.Keeping you at the edge of your seat not wondering why this was put in wasting time. Everything has a purpose.All actors do A-list performances and the special effects are top class. The casting stays true to the whole storyline as well.I can highly recommend this one and skip all other spin offs. They will just let you down. This one will not.,Rogue One,3748528
55,roystephen-81252,"See, J.J? It's not THAT hard",10/10,17 December 2016,"Now, that is how you do a decent spin-off.After last year's abomination (ie. The Force Awakens) I was very skeptical about Disney's ability to properly handle George Lucas's legacy, but Rogue One delivers in a major way. The story, the characters (K-2 rules!), the performances, the sets, the costumes etc. are all fine. They're fresh, they show variety and scope. But most importantly, Rogue One is NOT dumbed down to insulting imbecility as TFA was.It's not perfect, alright. It's mostly underlit. It's slower and longer than it should be. Being deliberately and significantly different, it occasionally loses the Star Wars feel. All in all, it's a little rough around the edges (especially CGI Leia's edges), but it does show a LOT more creativity than TFA did, and pays respect to Lucas instead of trampling on everything he'd built up so meticulously.It's proof that you CAN be original, you CAN be different, even break with established SW conventions (like the absence of the opening crawl), and still retain the REAL spirit of Star Wars.Rogue One rarely reaches the epic quality of Lucas's six-part saga, but it's a more than acceptable side story. And the spectacular finale that combines the visual grandeur of classic battle scenes from Revenge of the Sith, Return of the Jedi and the original Star Wars, is truly worthy of the Star Wars name.I've been a major SW fan since 1979. I'm not anti-Disney, anti- Abrams or whatever, and I'm certainly not a 'hater'. TFA made me sad and angry, but this one, this 'rogue one', I CAN accept as a Star Wars movie. Much, much better than TFA in every way.",Rogue One,3748528
56,zanyguy,This is what Star Wars is supposed to be,8/10,19 March 2021,"This movie is definitely not the best Star Wars movie but it is definitely a good one. This new set of characters is very fun and the way they are written and the way they are presented to us helps us to like them and to relate to them. When they die, it doesn't hurt as much as it would a regular Star Wars character, but it still hits because we went on an adventure with them and were able to experience what they went through. The most amazing aspect of this film was definitely Darth Vader. I like how the creators of this movie really dug into the potential that Darth Vader has and presented it in this film to the best of their ability, and I am so satisfied with the result. I just wish that people would see that this movie is really, really well made and worth a spot in the Star Wars top 5 movies.",Rogue One,3748528
57,owen-watts,"""The franchise is with me. And I am with the franchise.""",7/10,25 August 2022,"Gareth Edward's earthy and beautifully shot Wookiepedia entry still looks breathtaking but the characters are flimsy and the plot perfunctory. It functions solidly as a throwaway war film but the real appeal here is the lovely physicality of it all, the meshing of 70's sci-fi tech with modern cinema techniques. It's really lovely. Call me shallow but I can just sink into this one, deeply looking forward to Andor which looks to have a similar aesthetic.

59,hendersonandrew-61451,Has all the magic of the original trilogy,10/10,4 June 2023,"There's been some pretty average efforts from Disney recently with the Star Wars movies. And in my opinion, bringing The Emperor back in Rise of Skywalker was the biggest crime in movie history. But this movie, Rogue One, is amazing. Great pacing, insane action sequences and it's just an end to end brilliant film. It has that magic that hasn't been scene since Return of the Jedi. It perfectly ties into the beginning of A New Hope, the story has weight and meaning, good humour, and there's none of the childish crap that always finds its way into the other Star Wars prequels/sequels. This movie slaps, I highly recommend.

60,vailsy,this and the original trilogy are enough for me,9/10,4 May 2021,"I first heard the story about the Death Star plans in the radio adaption of Star Wars so the plans back story has always been a part of Star Wars for me since the beginningRogue One is different to that radio adaption but it's really well done .. great casting, everything feels super authentic like the original trilogy, really nice effects, original music etcThe only negative for me are the facial cgi effects for Leia and Tarkin .. they looked less than stellar on release and are destined to age badly unless they redo them later. From a technical perspective they are very impressive but once made why not be humble enough to then use them to make super realistic distance shots. I don't understand the need to have close upsIt also would have been far more epic to have a distance shot reminiscent of the first one we see of Leia in a new hope with r2d2 . The final scene could have also then been slower.. it feels very sudden and rushed at the end of Rogue OneOverall this is still the only movie that feels like part of the original trilogy.. far better than all the prequels and sequels. I'd happily just watch this and the original three unless they make another as good as this in the future.",Rogue One,3748528

R1 is just plain awesome & one of the best Star Wars movies ever it is : Visually Stunning , beautifully shot , great Characters who you care about , great cameo's from familiar characters , the most epic stunning & best space battle of the entire saga , the best Darth Vader scene ever , some great humour too especially by K2- SO he steels the show & makes you laugh out loud in some scenes . R1 is probably better than TFA & right up there with TESB as possibly the no2 Star Wars movie , it's a dark & gritty war movie that will please fans , it's also fast paced & feels like an hour 15 not 2 hours but that's not a bad thing there's never a dull moment cause there's so many gorgeous thing to took at & a great score too .",Rogue One,3748528
62,Funkenspalter,"Rogue One, is a class scifi film.",8/10,19 April 2023,"Of all the recent Star Wars films, this one is the best for me. Yes, the ending should be familiar to anyone who has seen Star Wars films before. But here the rare synthesis of bringing the old films together in a new time succeeds. Something like the computer game ""Alien Isolation"". That the prehistory is taken seriously, the plot is carried on consistently and real heart and soul is put into the project. That's why the film feels so good and is watchable several times. Not everything is perfect, but the bar is very high. This film stands on its own in the Star Wars universe and it looks like it won't change much anytime soon. I'd like to see more of that, but unfortunately we get annoyed with such cucumber series like Bad Batch, Obi Wan etc. Movies like Solo: A Star Wars Story are coming out, they would be rejected by me in the planning stages and don't even get me started on the other recent movies. So again the bottom line - Rogue One, is a class scifi film.

64,alexarag,An Amazing Addition to the Star Wars Saga—5/5 For Star Wars (Spoiler Free),7/10,15 December 2016,"Gareth Edwards and his crew accomplished something I never thought would be possible: they contributed a great Star Wars film to the Star Wars saga and canon.This movie was great as far as Star Wars is concerned. It truly *felt* like a real Star Wars movie, and not a cheap fan service attempt like the Force Awakens was (although the Force Awakens was very fun, it felt like it didn't take Star Wars itself seriously enough).So what worked with this one? Here's the list:1)The story. It felt like a totally believable space fantasy story, and furthermore a totally believable Star Wars story. It clearly was Gareth Edwards doing his own thing with Star Wars but also paying total respect to the path George Lucas originally paved with a New Hope.At the end of the day this story is a GOOD Star Wars story and it feels like it can be placed alongside the original trilogy in story quality.2)Not only the story, but the fact it was taken seriously.Whether you like the Force Awakens or not, you got to admit, it felt a bit cartoony. It didn't feel like a *serious* addition to the Star Wars saga. It felt as if that the people involved certainly liked Star Wars, but in a very fan-servicy sort of way. Everything felt very ""fun"" in the Force Awakens, but not serious. Rogue One doesn't fall into this trap. It was an amusing and fun ride surely, but the story was clearly priority here.Furthermore, the story elements and movie went *dark* when it needed to and didn't hold back. If the story needed death, that's what we saw. If it needed to show slaughter and killing, we saw it.3)No element of Star Wars was abused.There was no over abuse of lighstabers, the Force, or any old Star Wars characters. Wherever there was any fan service in this movie, it was done VERY tastefully. A respectful nod to the previous movies, but it never went ""HEY LOOK HOW COOL THIS IS. THIS IS SOMETHING YOU GUYS LOVE, RIGHT?""4)The characters and the actors that played them.Star Wars is never going to be known as a movie with ""great acting"", but full credit should go to the actors in this edition of Star Wars. They did a great job of bringing life to these characters— enough for us to care about them and the action occurring on screen, but not so much that it distracted from the ensemble story.5)The pacing. This movie was perfect Star Wars pacing. And by perfect Star Wars pacing, I refer to Empire Strikes Back. This was not an overly speedy movie that gave you no time to think, and yet it was not an overly slow and drawn out movie.6)The tie-in with the original trilogy.This story takes place before A New Hope. And as much as Rogue One completely does it's own thing and takes its own direction as a standalone film, it *beautifully* ties in with the original series. As I said above, I completely believe and accept this story as great Star Wars material as much as I do George Lucas' original stories.Overall, this Star Wars film is a 5/5 Star Wars film. I only rate it 7/10 on IMDb because, well, Star Wars is Star Wars and not the Godfather :D. As far as Rogue One stands in movie history, it's a great action movie. But as a Star Wars film it now has a special place in my heart.My personal new Star Wars top 3 ranking goes as follows: 1)Empire Strikes Back 2)A New Hope 3)Rogue One",Rogue One,3748528

67,prospectus_capricornium,"Utterly moving, most powerful 'Star Wars' story since A New Hope",10/10,16 December 2016,"A sequel to 'Revenge of the Sith', a prequel to 'A New Hope', 'Rogue One' is essentially a bridge that resembles to a colossal effort to accomplish three functions: explain the past, predict the future, create a tangible link between them, the last of which, this Gareth Edwards-helmed sci-fi giant is able to pull off with a brimming sense of nostalgic sentimentality. Often dark and brooding, there is an appealing force that emerges from its layers, continuously drawing us into the depths of 'Star Wars' cosmic saga that started to storm the box office, four decades ago. The 'force' persists in its riveting presence all throughout the film's visceral development, a monumental feat that itsTony Gilroy and Chris Weitz-written screenplay is able to preserve, even in the absence of the Jedi and Ewoks, Jar Jar Binks and the iconic opening crawl. In effect, the stand alone film manages to break down barriers, provide solutions to old puzzles, while practically presenting new ones that even non-religious spectators would be engaged to solve. That its motives is primarily enforced by the breathtaking visual renders of the film's explosive sequences, is out of the question, but the singular element that propels the film into action, is the story's protagonist, herself, and what she represents. Driven by a female hero at its reins like last year's 'The Force Awakens', this 'Star Wars' story revolves around petty criminal Jyn (Felicity Jones) and the band of misfits she gathered- -one that includes rebel spy, Cassian (Diego Luna), a reprogrammed imperial droid named KS2O, who shares the biggest chunk of the film's comic effort, and a blind monk whose martial arts-adroitness seemingly dares to put Matt Murdock's echolocation expertise to shame--to steal the plans to the 'Death Star', a deadly weapon, so powerful it can obliterate an entire planet. The emotional weight of the narrative is gathered across the length of Jyn's ambitious mission, which the film's primal campaign itself, labeled as a 'rebellion built on hope', a screaming hint to the looming much bigger movement led by Princess Leia, that sets the whole course for the original trilogy.Faithful to the tradition of female- centric narratives, Jyn's motivations is largely fueled by the traumatic childhood she endured: she saw her mother died at the mercy of an imperial superior, and the capture of his father who was forcefully recruited to engineer the empire's deadliest weapon--the Death Star. In the absence of an initiative, she courageously leads a highly-volatile expedition of recovering the plan to the Death Star, whose small but utterly significant flaw--one that could help the Rebel Alliance stop its cataclysmic power--is revealed by her father. Save for Jyn's uninspiring fight- for-freedom speech, only because it sounds monotonous, the whole run of 'Rogue One', is a glaring testament of what a mere hope can muster in the wake of a ruling authoritarian regime. The film then becomes a picture of a political atmosphere, infested with injustice and oppression, that bears a striking recognition. 'Trust the force', says Jyn's mother, in a tone that almost makes us believe that a movement always remains smoldering, only waiting to be ignited by small but resilient flames in the hands of courageous beings, awakened to rise by the screaming social malignance and political malfunction around them. The first of 'Star Wars' stand-alone films, 'Rogue One' is bold and moving with its lingering sense of humanity, nostalgic in its almost flawless integration with the saga's established structure, and ingeniously innovative in creating a whole new sci-fi space-war narrative that isn't devoid of the familiar 'the- force-is-with-me' sentiment. At its final moments, the film practically inserts a missing piece between the end and the beginning of the second and first trilogies, ending with a powerful one-second scene that can potentially make a voice in every spectator's head chant ""I am with the force; the force is with me"".",Rogue One,3748528

I wished episode 7 to 9 were that good.Rogue One is a complete Story with good characters and an interesting story idea. The overall look and feel i enjoy the most and it overshadows a bit a lack of overall tension - in a positive way.It may is an advantage that Rogue One did not need to tie into the Skywalker Saga, just being a side story and have an independent story to tell with new characters.Although i generally did not like the type of ending they choose, it's the perfect and best choice possible and it's also different from any other Star Wars movie.",Rogue One,3748528

The action is extremely thrilling, the characters completely capture you in their past and personality, and the last thirty minutes is so much more satisfying and entertaining than I remember it. It's a shame that Star Wars 8 & 9 weren't as good as this, but at least Andor is. Go watch Rogue One if you haven't already and if you have, it could be time to rewatch it and see if you're viewpoint on it is different than the last time you've watched it; I know mine is, and I'm glad I rewatched this gem.

71,EvanAlmindo,Rebels with a Cause: The Brilliance of Rogue One,9/10,14 August 2023,"In the constellation of ""Star Wars"" films, ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,"" directed by Gareth Edwards, shines with a brilliance that is both refreshing and profound. With a score of 9.1/10, it's a film that not only pays homage to its roots but also carves out its own unique place in the galaxy.""Rogue One"" tells the story of a group of rebels led by Jyn Erso, who embark on a daring mission to steal the plans for the Death Star, the Empire's ultimate weapon. It's a tale of courage, sacrifice, and hope, set against the backdrop of a galaxy torn by conflict.Visually, ""Rogue One"" is a masterclass in cinematic artistry. Edwards' direction is both bold and nuanced, capturing the grandeur of the ""Star Wars"" universe while also focusing on the intimate details that make the story human. The cinematography is breathtaking, with landscapes that are both alien and familiar, and action sequences that are choreographed with precision and flair. The sound design, too, is impeccable, weaving together the iconic sounds of ""Star Wars"" with new auditory textures that enhance the film's emotional impact.The film's narrative is a triumph of storytelling. It's a plot that's both simple and complex, driven by characters who are flawed and relatable. Jyn's journey from disillusionment to belief is compelling and believable, and the film's ensemble cast brings depth and humanity to their roles. The pacing is measured and deliberate, allowing the story to unfold with a natural rhythm that builds to a climax that's both thrilling and heartbreaking.""Rogue One"" also succeeds in its ethical exploration. It's a film that doesn't shy away from the moral complexities of war, examining the choices and compromises that define both heroes and villains. It's a film that challenges and provokes, asking questions about loyalty, duty, and the nature of hope.From a global perspective, ""Rogue One"" stands as a testament to the universal power of storytelling. It's a film that resonates across cultures and languages, reflecting themes and emotions that are both specific to the ""Star Wars"" universe and universally human.The film's few shortcomings are minor and do little to diminish its overall impact. Some characters could have benefited from more development, and certain plot twists might feel convenient to seasoned viewers. But these are small quibbles in a film that's otherwise a resounding success.""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"" is a film that honors its legacy while also forging its own path. It's a film that's both epic and intimate, thrilling and thoughtful. It's a film that reminds us that even in a galaxy far, far away, the stories that resonate most are those that speak to the human heart. It's a film that's not just a worthy addition to the ""Star Wars"" saga but a standout film in its own right. It's a journey that's worth taking, a battle that's worth fighting, and a story that's worth telling. It's ""Star Wars"" at its best, and cinema at its most powerful.",Rogue One,3748528
72,zkonedog,"First ""Star Wars Story"" A Rousing Success",8/10,27 February 2017,"When the Star Wars franchise was turned over to Disney from George Lucas, many worried that it would be ""commodified"" too much, to the point that their would be an over-saturation and dilution of the material. ""Rogue One"", the first ""Star Wars Story"" (not featuring the canon roman numerals or opening scrawl), would be the initial test to see how the material would be handled. By almost all accounts, it was a tremendous success!For a basic plot summary (only minor spoilers), ""Rogue One"" tells the story of how the Rebel Alliance steals the plans for the Imperial Death Star weapon, which sets up the events of Episode IV: A New Hope. The film focuses on Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones), daughter of the Galen Erso (Mads Mikkelsen) forced to work for the Empire on the Death Star itself. When of age to join the Rebel cause, Jyn meets the mysterious Saw Gerrera (Forest Whitaker) and then is sent on a dangerous mission with Cassian Andor (Diego Luna). On the ""Dark Side"" of things, Orson Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn) is tasked with making sure the Death Star is fully operational, overseen by Governor Tarkin (Guy Henry/CGI) and even Lord Vader himself.When coming into this movie experience, I had absolutely no idea what to expect. Suffice it to say, it pretty much blew away even those ambiguous expectations. It doesn't try to do too much, yet at the same time it isn't too sparse and thus is filled with call-backs or ""easter eggs"" to ""A New Hope"". It really does find that perfect balance. One thing to be prepared for is a lot of material to be throw at you in the first 1/3 to 1/2 of the film. It jumps around to many different planets and puts a lot of balls in the air. To be honest, halfway through the film I was a bit worried that it was going to be ""just okay"". The final half or two-thirds, however, sees everything come together in a way that is just as impressive (both dramatically and visually) as any piece in the rest of the Star Wars canon.It's amazing to me how a single scene from ""A New Hope"" (evaluating the stolen Death Star plans) could inspire an entire film, and I'm even more impressed that a really solid movie could be produced as a result! It would be very, very easy for Disney to start cranking these movies out (they are guaranteed money-makers right now) irregardless of quality, but fortunately the Mouse House seems (at least so far) to be taking the utmost care of the franchise. My brothers and I will be arguing for months over where to watch this movie in the grand scheme of things, and I consider perhaps the best compliment I can give a Star Wars film.",Rogue One,3748528
73,LeonLouisRicci,"""Rebellions are Built on Hope""......and Sacrifice",9/10,21 November 2017,"This is a ""War"" Story...A Star ""Wars"" Story.Its Template is of Rag Tag and Grit. Dirty, Disheveled, and Dour, the Movie Feels like the Only Thing going for the ""Rebels"" is Hope. This Supposedly ""Stand Alone"" Film does No Such Thing.It is Directly Tied into the Beginning of the Whole Darn Franchise. This is a Prequel and it Presupposes what Happened in the Immediate Past just before ""Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope"" Premiered On Screens in 1977.The Synopsis of the Film is that Opening Crawl of the George Lucas' Game Changer.This Film is Dark, Violent, and Desperate. There are many Highlights and a Lot of it is Shot in Low Light. Although Filmed Digitally it takes Great Pains to Shoot Practical when it is Practical to do so.There are Grand Battle Sequences and at the Center of the Story is the Plans for the ""Death Star"". There are Cameos from Familiar Characters and much of the Hardware of the Original is at hand for Suspense and Sprawling Sequences of Mayhem.Some Complain that the New Characters are Lacking, but this is a Group Story. Names of the Rebels become Elusive as does the Places and Planets, because in the End this is about One Thing and One Thing Only...Hope...for the Survival of the Rebellion and the Elimination of an Awesome Weapon of Mass Destruction and the Sacrifice it took to Get the Job Done.Overall, it is not as Kid Friendly or as much Family Fun as ""The Force Awakens"" (2015). This is Serious. It is Great ""Star Wars"" Stuff and a Significant Entry in the Franchise.",Rogue One,3748528
74,MrTGav,A True Star Wars Film,10/10,9 August 2017,"I was so grateful for the release of Rogue One after the disappointment of Ep7 The Force Awakens. The latter currently scoring just slightly higher than Rogue One on IMDb (at 8.1). Sure Ep7 serves a purpose and clearly satisfies it's contemporary demographic. But it's one that I do not associate with, myself being a massive fan of the original trilogy from back in the day. Rogue One really understands the Star Wars ethos and plays out all the beats of the originals, staying true to the lore with integrity and originality. You know watching Rogue One that the director is a fan and is 100 percent invested, making it all the more easy for the viewer to invest also. And that I did.The real highlight of this movie is the return of Darth Vader, who's ominous presence is felt throughout and as the tension reaches it's climactic crescendo he gives us a moment of such awe and dread it's right up there amongst his most iconic scenes. With all the superficial remakes and expanded universe franchises being churned out today. Rogue One took us back to that familiar world of A New Hope, where the sense of peril and wonderment is back to it's visceral best. Kudos to Gareth Edwards for this standalone movie. It is so well crafted, brilliantly acted and tidily scripted. But more importantly it truly is the love letter all Star Wars fans have been longing for. 10/10",Rogue One,3748528
75,charbelelaro,Some of the best action sequences in the Star Wars series,7/10,2 April 2019,"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, is directed by Gareth Edwards and takes place between episodes 3 and 4 of the Star Wars series. This film is highly entertaining, as it contains some of the best action sequences in the Star Wars series. At moments the CGI is jaw dropping. Visually this movie is great. Also the storyline is quite interesting, as explains unknown information which leads to what occurs in episode 4. The characters were likeable and well acted, although they were not given enough depth. The audience knows little to nothing about most characters and it really makes it hard to connect and feel for them at times. Also the score by Michael Giacchino sounds a little rushed at times as he was only given 4 weeks to write the music. I feel that there could have been more creative sounds based around the themes by John Williams. Overall I really enjoyed Rogue One. It's a film that really entertained me, particularly in the 3rd act. It's no where near the best Star Wars film, so therefore I give it a 7.

76,BA_Harrison,The Star Wars Universe is back on track.,9/10,24 December 2016,"I'm a little late to the party, but for what it's worth, here's my two cents on Rogue One, the direct prequel to the original Star Wars, which shows how a brave group of rebels risked all to acquire the plans to the Empire's latest weapon, The Death Star.After the disappointment that was The Force Awakens, I went into Rogue One with low expectations, which only served to make a very good film even more of a pleasure to behold. What we have here is a vast improvement over J.J. Abrams' unimaginative retread of A New Hope, a standalone spin-off story that is surprisingly dark, violent and gritty, especially considering that it is a product of the House of Mouse. Director Gareth Edwards tells his gripping tale of hope, bravery and sacrifice with an assured hand, delivering engaging characters (with a droid—K-2SO—stealing every scene 'he' is in), pathos, humour and, of course, excitement, the excellent action set pieces a marvel to behold (the rebel X-wing fighters attacking the Imperial Star destroyers is breath-taking).If this is the standard that Disney has set for future films in the Star Wars Universe, then I'm back to being a faithful fan. 8.5/10, happily rounded up to 9 for IMDb despite the patently CGI Moff Tarkin and Princess Leia.",Rogue One,3748528
77,WooderIce64,Best New Star Wars Movie,9/10,3 December 2018,"The idea of the Star Wars series making movies outside of the main story was questionable at first, given the sheer amount they could explore, and how that would tie in to the main story. If they're all as good as Rogue One, then they're good to go. It follows the story of the Rebellion, and how they came to acquire the Death Star plans, which was the central conflict of the original 1977 Star Wars movie. While it may seem unnecessary to explain that, it does it well enough to keep us interested with a new set of characters, some mysteries explained, and some absolutely fantastic action.There's a whole new set of characters. The main character is Jyn Erso, the daughter of the architect of the Death Star. She's not the type to get involved in the war, or to really care about it, at least at the start of the movie. She's joined by a gang of new characters, the best of which is Chirrut. Chirrut is played by Donnie Yen, popular Chinese movie star. He may or may not be Force sensitive, but he's an excellent fighter and a very wise man. The other major character is Captain Andor, the morally ambiguous leader of the group. However, it's impossible to talk about Rogue One without the ending. Everyone dies. Every single member of that crew dies. Not even K2-SO, the comic relief droid, is safe. While that may put a lot of people off, it was necessary. It avoids the giant plothole of not having them in the Originals.It's very different from most of the Star Wars movies for a host of different reasons. The first, and most notable, is that there is very little usage of the Force. The Force is at the center of the main conflicts in the core Star Wars series, Originals, Prequels, and Sequels alike. Despite the lack of the Force, it still feels like a Star Wars movie. This is, however, owed to the fact that several classic characters and vehicles return. The other notable difference is that it's the most violent movie in the series, bar none. There's no question about it. While the main Star Wars series has all sorts of Science Fiction violence, Rogue One felt more like a straight up war movie set in the Star Wars Galaxy. This is likely due to the presence of familiar weapons and ships.There's no denying that Darth Vader is the best thing about the movie. He's the reason a lot of people saw this movie. For anyone who didn't see the Originals in theaters, this was the chance to see Vader on the big screen. He only has two scenes, one with Krennic, and then ""the scene."" The scene is the ultimate fanboy moment; watching Vader rampage through a hall of Rebel soldiers. The other nostalgic callbacks are welcome. Since it's set just before the Originals begin, you have the TIE Fighters, the X-Wings, the Star Destroyers, and of course, the Death Star. The Death Star was so cool. The best shot in the whole movie was the one where it forms an eclipse over Jedha. The Battle of Scarif is, dare I say, the best space battle in the entire series. The battle on the ground was very well done too. Seeing the Rebels and the Empire clash on the big screen again was a great experience, especially for those of who were born after the Originals came out. The cameos are awesome. It's an excellent addition to the Star Wars canon, and I'd say it'll be the best of the spin-offs for quite a long time.",Rogue One,3748528
78,lee_eisenberg,Episode 3 1/2: the non-Jedi story,8/10,20 December 2016,"The first thing to note about Gareth Edwards's ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"" is that it takes place in the same universe - or faraway galaxy, as the case may be - as the rest of the franchise, but it doesn't focus on the characters who dominate most of the series. The main character is the daughter of the Death Star's unwilling designer, making this the first movie in the series to have a woman as the main character. There are no Jedis or emphasis on the force. It's all about how Jyn Erso and her cohorts try to destroy the Death Star.More importantly, this is not the same sort of movie as ""The Force Awakens"". That one had more of a see-what-I-did-there? side to it, probably with the aim of entertaining the nerds and geeks. ""Rogue One"" is likely the most intense entry in the franchise, with a lot of violence.Otherwise, there's the usual sort of stuff that we've come to know (including a few surprise appearances). It's not a masterpiece, but an enjoyable movie nonetheless. Felicity Jones, Diego Luna, Ben Mendelsohn, Donnie Yen, Mads Mikkelsen, Alan Tudyk, Riz Ahmed, Forest Whitaker and the rest of the cast turn in some fine performances.Finally, unlike with ""The Phantom Menace"", I understood the plot (with TPM, I didn't understand the plot until I heard ""Weird Al"" Yankovic's song ""The Saga Begins"", a parody of Don McLean's ""American Pie"").",Rogue One,3748528
79,praveenjha-77481,Rogue One is what the Star Wars saga can boast of itself,8/10,9 January 2019,"Well after a long time I finally got my hands on first Star Wars anthology film that is Rogue One. Being a cinephile I simply couldn't control my excitement to begin with all those teaser-trailer stuff and jumped onto the Star Wars saga and what I saw can be summarised in a single word that is ""amazing"". Yes you heard it right, ""amazing"" is the term which is best suited for Rogue One. Finally after a long time I can confidently state that this movie is a well crafted peice of art to find its way under Star Wars belt. Gareth Edwards has done an impressive job by directing this film and in my opinion he should have been given a Star Wars trilogy of his own to direct. Rogue One like every great movie has its own sets of strengths and flaws which are discussed below.
First lets begin with the strength:
1. Story- Rogue One being an anthology film is something that perfectly fills in the void between the Revenge of Sith and A New Hope. It brilliantly bridges the gap between these two movies. Story is engaging, interesting and on the same hand has strong essence of emotion that creates a lasting impact on your mind. Infact it is one of those trademark star wars film in which emotional part takes the upper hand.
2. Screenplay- as I have stated earlier Gareth Edwards has done an amazing job which can be seen here.
3. Characters - a lot of people have stated the lack of character development as weakness of this movie. But in my opinion the lack of character development is more overshadowed by some really great characters that are introduced in this film and have the calibre to be remembered for a long time in the entire Star Wars Saga. Characters like chirrut imuwe, cassian, bodhi and K-2SO are simply among the best characters of star wars till date.
4. BGM - background music of movie as usual is good and syncs well with the situation. Infact the signature soundtrack of star wars can leave your heart brimming up with emotions during and after the film.
5. Visuals - visuals and CGI are one of the best part of the film. Though some people criticized the use of CGI to create General Tarkin and Leia Organa but according to me if you see it in another way that shows the hardwork done by the director and his efforts to make this film a treat for star wars audience. The film consists of some of the best war scenes between Rebel alliance and Empire along with the bunch of believers that strive to make this rebellion a success.
Now lets come to the flaws:
1. Opening Crawl - this is the first star wars film till date that has no opening crawl in the beginning along with trademark music of John Williams that used to grab the attention of audience from the very first scene reminding them of the tension brewing in galaxy (which I think is the most important as we come to know that what actually happened after the last star wars film ended and what is the situation in galaxy now)and that they are watching no ordinary scene but a Star Wars film.
2. Another problem is with the potrayal of Darth Vader. The scene in which the Vader is introduced in the film, he seemed to be a bit off from the Vader we are used to see in the previous star wars movie. Though the light saber battle involving Vader on spaceship during climax is one of the best Vader scenes I have seen till date (trust me it is intense), still the potrayal of Vader in his introduction scene is a bit weak which I think is a injustice done to the character of one of the most dangerous villains of galaxy.
3. Another thing that I would regard as downpoint is that the character of Galen Erso and Saw Garrera should have been given more screen time. They were killed off soon without some significant contribution to the story. Though Galen Erso builds a flaw in Death Star which enables rebels to destroy it still his character was off-screen the entire time and on-screen he died sooner he made his appearance in front of general. Saw garrera's character should also have been given more of screen presence as it was played by a prominent actor and his death was not an essential requirement of story.
4. This is first star war film in years where there is no jedi and no trademark light saber battles between dark force and bright side. Though it was important for the story but conflict of jedis is something I always look towards in a star wars film. Though there is light sabee batter involving Vader but it is a small scene against rebel soldiers and not some light saber wielding jedi.
In the end after pondering over all the strengths and weakness in the film I will conclude the Rogue One is one of the best star wars film ever made after original trilogy and had the capability to be the best one if some flaws were eradicated. But still I will regard it as an amazing star wars saga in years a film that has completely worthy of its inclusion in your must watch films list and my favourite star wars film after the original trilogy in star wars cinematic universe.",Rogue One,3748528
80,planktonrules,An enjoyable film with a zombie in one of the leading roles.,8/10,15 January 2017,"Back in 1977, Peter Cushing starred as Grand Moff Tarkin in the original ""Star Wars"" movie. ""Rogue One"" is set in the Star Wars world just before ""Star Wars"" and the studio decided to have Tarkin as one of the major characters, even though Cushing died in 1994. So instead of re-casting him, they did something that only modern technology could allow them to do--create a CG Tarkin that actually looks and sounds like Cushing!! It really is amazing and lifelike and for this reason alone, it's worth seeing the film. Now I pray that this sort of thing does not become the norm. Think about it...they COULD start making new films starring Clark Gable with Jennifer Lawrence or The Three Stooges and John Gielgud using CG-- it's getting THAT good!As for the movie, it's NOT as wonderful and perfect as many of my friends have said nor is it a bad film in any way. Instead of recapitulating the plot, I'll just say what makes this movie different from most Star Wars films. This is NOT a cutesy film. Aside from a tiny appearance by R2D2 and C3PO, the characters, including the droid, are not designed with cuteness and marketability towards children in mind. I really appreciate this-- and thank God there is no Jar-Jar!! Additionally, unlike the previous films this one is a downer with an ending where pert near everyone dies! I mention this because I would NOT advise folks with very young kids to bring them to see it.Overall, it's a well made film with a lot to recommend it. My only gripe is that you KNOW what will happen because it is a gap-filler and the audiences already know what must happen in the next film. I might be inclined to say more, but there are already a bazillion reviews for this blockbuster...so I'll end it here.",Rogue One,3748528

I really enjoyed this movie it was a good tie in to Episode 5 and it explains how the plans of the death star were saved.My favourite bit was that scene with Darth Vader not going to say which one thought.It had good acting.Good special effects.It is very promising to Star Wars fans.There will be reviews for Episode 7 and 8 I will be doing but they won't be friendly or positive whatsoever.

I thought it was well handled, even some of the controversial characters (I think one character specifically is going to split the SW community in two). The action sequences were great! Ground combat, space combat, melee, all done beautifully. I actually felt tired at the end of the movie because of the amount of things that were going on. Unfortunately the movie is too short for us to get to know the back stories of some of the more interesting characters. I'd recommend this too any SW fan. It's great to see a movie dedicated to the people that made helped the rebels take on the empire.I think I might even like this more than SW VII. Either way, you're bound to enjoy it. It's a great chapter in the SW universe.

89,alindsayal,A Fantastic War Film,9/10,18 December 2021,"Next step on the Star Wars review series is the first live action spinoff Rogue One: A Star Wars Story and this is my review for the film. The premise of the film sees a group of misfit rebels attempt to steal the Death Star Plans from The Empire.Main Character
Felicity Jones plays Jyn Erso the lead in this film and she is really good in the role, her character has plenty of depth to her and you really support her as the main character. You see her really develop over the film and it makes her journey a fascinating one to watch and makes you care about her as a character.Supporting Characters
This film has a huge supporting cast and Diego Luna as Cassion Andor is the main one, he introduces a new side to the Rebellion and it is great to see this more morally ambigous character associated with the Rebels as in the original trilogy they are presented as the squeaky clean heroes when it is clear there was more to them. Him and Jones has some good chemistry together and I liked how they interacted and how their characters develop during the film and bring out different sides to each other. Alan Tudyk voices the droid K2SO and he is the funniest part of the film, he makes you laugh plenty in the film but you also grow to care about him as he has more character then possibly any other droid in the Star Wars universe. Donnie Yen and Wen Jiang play Chirrut & Baze in the film and I really liked their characters, they have a really interesting dynamic together and I especially thought Yen's character was really interesting and a part of the most entertaining action scnenes in the film. Ben Mendelsohn plays the main villain Director Orson Krennic and he is the perfect Imperial in The Star Wars universe, he is very dislikeable and despicable making it easy not to like him, but it was interesting seeing his role in The Empire and how it affects him as a character.Story
This film's story does a really good job of building the group and making you care about each of them, it also adds depth to them and develops them as characters. It is an exciting story and feels like a war film scenario where you care about the characters survival and want to see them succeed. Also this film does a great job in making A New Hope's plot better and adding more depth to it. However, my main criticism for the film is that the story isn't that interesting for the first act and jumps all over the place making it hard to focus on a particular journey but it improves as the film progreses.Script
The script is great for this film, as mentioned it adds moral complexity to the rebels that makes them more human and more relatable to the audience. The drama feels very real and it adds to the emotion for the characters that you have especially in the last act. The humour is also well done mainly through K2SO but it was funny and felt appropriate for that character in the film.Style
The film looks fantastic, the war like action scenes are brutal and exciting at the same time. Whether they are on land or in space they feel epic in scale and exactly how war should be shown in The Star Wars Universe. To help this film has possibly my favourite action scene in any Star Wars film and a film that kept me on the edge of my seat.Overall
Overall, this is a fantastic Star Wars film, it feels like the most warlike film in this universe and does a great job showing the earlier stages of the rebellion and how the wheels are set in motion for A New Hope.Rating - 9/10.",Rogue One,3748528
90,slicedbread117,The Prequel Star Was Never Knew It Needed,9/10,10 September 2017,"I'll be the first to admit my lack of faith in the success (critically more than commercially) of Rogue One. As a fan who, like many others, live and die by Star Wars, the initial idea of a live- action film spin-off seemed risky. How ever was my lack of faith disturbing. Rogue One not only delivers a highly compelling, exceptionally entertaining film of its own accord, it undoubtedly strengthens the story of A New Hope (Episode IV), and the entire Star Wars saga as well.This was no easy task for director Gareth Edwards and his staff of writers; to be trusted to produce a worthy spin-off story in arguably the largest franchise in the world is a daunting undertaking. The conclusion was to tell the story of the rebel team who stole the original plans to the Death Star, a team we had heard about in Episode IV but never got to see. There simply could not have been a better choice for the plot of Star Wars' first spin-off, as Rogue One contains one of the best individual stories in Star Wars history. There is a much grittier, boots-on-the-ground feeling to this film, but even with the more grounded atmosphere, it still very much feels like a Star Wars movie. We see a new approach to the storytelling; new worlds, new characters, new stakes, and we also see classic vehicles, characters and more. It's a shot of fresh air into the lungs of what fans have come to expect, yet maintains the heart of a Star Wars film. Seeing the touching sacrifices that each member of the Rogue One team makes is powerful and enticing, making character connections to the audience that strengthens the depth of the film. The pacing was excellent for the most part, with some minor hiccups here and there. Possibly the greatest narrative strength, however, belongs to Rogue One's ability to tie into A New Hope flawlessly. This is, after all, a prequel film to Episode IV, and with it the foundation of A New Hope shifts heavily in the best way possible. We get so much more insight on the events of Episode IV, including an explanation to arguably the biggest plot hole in the entire saga. All throughout, Rogue One secures a spot among the best stories ever told in the galaxy far far away.As good as the story is, Rogue One's undisputed backbone is the phenomenal set of characters leading said story. The ragtag squad that is Rogue One is filled with wonderful characters, lead by Jyn Erso who is fantastic. The real stand out, however, is K-2SO, a new droid who constantly makes you smile, providing wonderful comedic relief. The new set of characters are rounded out by rebel Cassian Andor, solid new antagonist Director Krennic, Jyn's father, Galen Erso, and the awesome duo of Chirrut Imwe and Baze Malbus, who have great on-screen chemistry. These new characters are terrific in Rogue One and help further the roster of lovable Star Wars characters for fans to cherish.Though Rogue One introduces new characters, it's some of the age-old classics are show stoppers. Aside from Darth Vader (who I'll get to shortly), the digital recreation of the late Peter Cushing's iconic Grand Moff Tarkin is a staple of the film, and is executed brilliantly. We also get to see Mon Monthma, Saw Gerrera, Bail Organa and even a brief shot of Princess Leia herself, who also was digitally redone for her short scene. Seeing the connection of new and old characters is splendid and to see them all bridge the story into Episode IV is even better.The actors themselves bring each character to life beautifully. Felicity Jones is solid as Jyn, Alan Tudyk plays the voice and mo- cap of K-2SO perfectly, Ben Mendelsohn is aggressive and intimidating as Krennic but the gold star goes to Guy Henry, who, aided by CGI, recreates Tarkin so well that it's almost indistinguishable. Without going on too long, the cast was excellent from top to bottom.Of course, Star Wars is known for its big-budget action scenes, stunning visuals and masterful audio, and Rogue One continues the legacy of what to expect from a Star Wars film. The action sequences are intense, exciting and intriguing, especially in the third act with the superb final battle between space and on land. The different locations give way for gorgeous set pieces and CGI, and while not composed by John Williams, the score fits the style of the film and keeps the Star Wars feeling intact.It'd be a disservice if I didn't dedicate a section to the final scene of the film. Darth Vader, one of the most legendary names in all of fiction, makes his triumphant return to the saga in Rouge One, becoming the center of what is one of the greatest scenes in Star Wars history. Vader boards the rebel ship which holds the stolen Death Star plans, and in desperation to retrieve them, Vader mercilessly slaughters numerous terrified rebels in his path. The iconic glow of his red lightsaber, his overwhelming power of the Dark Side being showcased to a maximum, this is the Vader every fan has dreamed of seeing. The scene completely stole the film, and also lead directly into Episode IV, giving it legitimacy as well as being down right epic.The Star Wars galaxy is large with many stories to be told. Rogue One might not traverse too far away from the original trilogy, but that doesn't for one second keep it from being an astoundingly entertaining piece of film and a more than worthy entry into the prestigious Star Wars saga.9.5/10",Rogue One,3748528

92,saghy122,Best movie of the franchise,9/10,13 May 2019,"I wish we could erase Disney's disgraceful new trilogy and replace it with spin-offs like this. Rogue One is a literal war drama and the prequel to Episode IV. It's more serious than ever, darker then ever and this should have been the direction for all current Star Wars projects. I was blown by how great it was. The actors were amazing, the story was thrilling, the visuals left me speechless. It's a joke that The Force Awakens is on a higher score than this. Rogue One is superior in every way.

94,Holt344,"Rogue One is a prequel to A New Hope that tells the reality of war with a terrific cast of characters, there's also plenty of tension and suspension - My Ultimate Review",10/10,14 January 2022,"Rogue One is an all-new epic adventure directed by Gareth Edwards and written by Chris Weitz and Tony Gilroy. In a time of conflict, a group of unlikely heroes band together on a mission to steal the plans to the Death Star, the Empire's ultimate weapon of destruction. But this film is so much more than a prequel to A New Hope which revolves around the Rebellion trying to destroy the Death Star. With well written, morally grey and likeable characters, but also lots of characters from the prequel trilogy and the Clone Wars tv show; like Bail Organa, Mon Mothma, Saw Gerrera, Vader, Tarkin and a bunch of cameos. But it's the new ones that leaves a mark; characters like Jyn Erso, Cassian Andor, Orson Krennic, Galen Erso and K-2SO. The main cast consists of Felicity Jones, Diego Luna, Ben Mendelsohn, Donnie Yen, Mads Mikkelsen, Alan Tudyk, Forest Whitaker, Riz Ahmed and Jiang Wen.Rogue One: A Star Wars story is Star Wars at its best because of many things, there's plenty of tension and suspension and the war genre is a big reason of it, the franchise was built on war and this film stays true to the war aspect and the director and his crew made a superb Star Wars film. It gives depth to A New Hope, but also to the whole rebellion and years fought, and because both the dark and heroic parts of the Alliance & Rebels are explored. Moreover, this is a movie worth seeing for its own catchy plot, full of revenge, family and quest for redemption. It was based on an idea first pitched by John Knoll ten years before the film entered development, Rogue One was made to be different in tone and style from the traditional Star Wars films, omitting the customary opening crawl and transitional screen wipes. Thus making the film more grounded and like a war movie as Edwards stated ""It's the reality of war. Good guys are bad. Bad guys are good. It's complicated, layered; a very rich scenario in which to set a movie."" Having critically acclaimed cinematographer Greig Fraser onboard makes for a stunning and literally mesmerizing film. Michael Giacchino is no John Williams but his musical score and orchestra brings a different yet similar in some way to the franchise, Michael's music fits the war genre and the story Rogue One is telling. The action sequences are all excellent, with the various of planets used, there are a sense of world building and expanding the galaxy. With planets like Jedha, Eadu and where the climax takes place, Scarif. The climax sequence on Scarif is some of the best Star Wars I've ever seen, what transpires there is what turned out to be the Rebel Alliance's first effective victory against the Empire, first referenced in A New Hope's opening crawl. There's some real emotional weight in Rogue One, the story is just superbly told. Gareth Edwards have created something memorable, something that's visually stunning and entertaining to look at.I've said that the well written characters are a huge reason why this film works so well, it's also the actors who play them who make them work on screen. Felicity Jones plays Jyn Erso, a flawed and human character that at first could be seen as a dislikeable character but what Rogue One does well is its character development that makes these morally grey and human characters into such interesting and ultimately characters. Other well acted performances are Diego Luna as Cassian Andor, a Rebel captain and intelligence officer, Ben Mendelsohn as Orson Krennic, the director of advanced weapons research for the Imperial military and Mads Mikkelsen as Galen Erso, Jyn's father and a research scientist. Whilst Forest Whitaker's role is smaller than I would have wanted as Saw Gerrera, a veteran of the Clone Wars and a friend of the Erso family who had mentored Jyn in her later childhood years. His presence is felt throughout the entire film, Whitaker's take on the character that have been in both Clone Wars and Rebels and now Fallen Order. He's still terrific in this film, playing this old man who have fought his entire life, it's a performance felt through his emotion. The comedic relief comes mostly from Alan Tudyk as K-2SO, a former Imperial enforcer droid who was reprogrammed by Cassian Andor to serve the Rebellion. But the character is also quite great, I just love the actor and the work he did for K-2SO.Rogue One has everything a film in this franchise needs to have and they do it perfectly. It brought us a spectacular and cinematic experience at the cinema but also back home, thinking back to my first viewing and now on my forth, it's still amazing. It's my first time watching it on 4k Bluray and it almost matches the experience at the cinema. It also spawned a prequel tv show called Andor which focuses on the title character's adventures in the rebellion before the events of Rogue One. My criticism is a spoiler so I won't go into detail but the film's flaw is the writing, but Gareth Edwards' makes up for it, it's mostly one decision the writers took but most of the dialogue were fixed during reshoots which saved the movie. Other than some of its writing, I think Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is a strong candidate for one of the best Star Wars films.",Rogue One,3748528

96,tabuno,Darker But More or Less of the Same,7/10,12 January 2019,"26 December 2016. Without giving too much away, consider the dilemma of trying to tie in a prequel to the original Star Wars movie, and you'll get some of the darkness that this movie might entail. Missing are all the epic, royal court melodrama and trappings of the Empire. The audience only gets flashes of what is about too come, almost not enough. The beginning is a hodgepodge of flittering scenes that almost require a voice-over to explain what is going on along with a loud musical score to retain audience interest in these initial less than spectacular scenes.What this episode attempts to present is a substantive storyline about sacrifice, parent-child loyalty, betrayal, and most of all ""hope"". There is no Harrison Ford persona to capture theater replaced by an evolving one in the form of a young girl transforming into a young adult. Overall, this episode is more about terror and rebelling against it at small odds and a lot of shooting, explosions, and killing, and dying. The premise that the larger the better as is profoundly used in this movie, may not always be better than the quality of the story.",Rogue One,3748528
