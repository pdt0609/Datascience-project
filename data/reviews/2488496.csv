0,coasterdude44,Ghost of a Movie. Nothing more than a sociopathic superficial cash grab,7/10,15 April 2016,"This film really is nothing more than an Advertisement. I'll admit the first time I saw it at the movies I thought it was pretty good, and i watched it another two times with friends and family over the course of a month before it finally left theatres. But after seeing it again, I realised something is off, something is not right about this movie. It's completely hollow with nothing beyond its visualsThe movie is well shot, I'll say that. It has great looking effects, but it's only there to hide the fact that once you look past all the superficial razzle dazzle to hide the mess underneath. The movie is nothing more than a shadow of the previous movies. Everything about it feels rushed. The characters are so aloof and seem almost brain dead. The dialogue is so shallow and paper thin, it's like the writers just gave up. The characters hardly develop or learn anything and Rey's transition to a Jedi is so fast and forced, you can see how how obvious that the writers were too lazy to even bother to give give her a proper arc and story and make her feel like an actual human we can care about. Because that would be too long and boring, wouldn't it... God forbid challenge people's short attention spans... Who even needs real developed characters... Nobody cares about that anymore... Just give them the razzle dazzle crap or whatever???It really is sad just how empty this movie is. The third time I watched it, it actually physically left a bad taste in my mouth, thank god for popcorn...",Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,2488496
1,Ben-Hibburd,Star Wars: The Force Awakens Review(re-upload),8/10,22 August 2017,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens Is a newest chapter in the long running Space opera saga, taking place 30 years after the events of Return of the Jedi. We learn from the opening text crawl that in the absence of Luke Skywalker, the sinister First Order has risen into power led by the menacing Kylo Ren(Adam Driver), who is on the hunt for the last Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker. He is introduced into the film in an explosive sequence setting the tone for the remainder of the film. Driver brings a lot of raw emotion to the part of Ren, who's being tormented by his feelings, and lure to the Light and Dark side. During the opening scene Ren comes into contact with newcomer Poe Dameron(Oscar Issac) a rebel fighter pilot regarded as the best in the resistance. Who is handed a vital piece of information, that could lead to the whereabouts of Luke Skywalker, and thus sets off a chain of events bringing in old and new characters alike. Issac brings a-lot of likability as Poe to the film, and was reminiscent of Han Solo(Harrison Ford) In the original trilogy. Whilst on the Planet of Jakku we're introduced to Finn(John Boyega) a disillusioned stormtrooper, who wants out of the First Order. Boyega plays the part with a lot enthusiasm, and joy he brings a lot of laughs to the story whilst maintaining his own dramatic moments through out the story. He eventually comes into contact with a scavenger named Rey(Daisy Ridley) on the planet Jakku. Who struggles to make a living finding scraps/relics for food, she is also torn between waiting for her family to come back, and realising that her journey is much more then salvaging parts, when She crosses paths with Finn and a lovable new droid named BB8. After a thrilling escape from the First Order our heroes come across veterans of the original series Han Solo(Ford) and the Wookie Chewbacca(Peter Mayhew). Ford does a good job of tying the mythos of the original trilogy, and connecting us with the newcomers, without ever leaving old viewers feeling cold and new viewers guessing as too what is happening.From the moment the film begins it maintains a breakneck pace, that hardly allows the viewer to stop and reflect what's happening with the plot of the film, which Is a good thing, because there are a-lot of plot holes In the film. We are also given enough information sprinkled throughout the film so that all the new characters feel fleshed out enough, to make us care about them.The film spends most of the first half on a desert planet named Jakku, The cinematography Is beautiful to look at, the screen Is filled with sweeping landscapes that gives the world a vast feeling of isolation and hopelessness. Disney brought In director JJ Abrams, who recently came off of rebooting the successful Star Trek franchise. He's the perfect choice to re-invigorate this franchise, his use of practical effects give this film a weight that all the prequels were sorely missing. We feel the size and scope of Starkiller Base, the heaviness of the Lightsabers, you feel the impact of the blaster rifles. The use of real locations and sets also give the film a-lot of natural colour which bursts onto the screen. Where-as the prequel trilogy which was all shot on digital, and Used a lot of CGI characters and effects. CGI in the film is used to a minimum and only used when needed. There were however a couple of characters, Unkar Plutt and Maz Kanata which felt like they could of been done better. In a couple scenes they look out place when surrounded by practical effects and actors in costumes and make up. Overall the film is visually stunning to look at because of this it gives the film(and series) a fresh vibrancy that has been lacking since Return of the Jedi. There are also just the right amount of callbacks, without it becoming crowd-pleasing, there is a plenty of nostalgia and references to the original films that fans of the series will recognise. John Williams also creates a new score with him that feels a little lacklustre when compared to original and prequel films. The only memorable theme being Kylo Rens.There were on the other hand certain aspects of the film which felt like it was treading old water from A New Hope, especially Starkiller Base, which is essentially a third Deathstar that feels like it's only part of the film so there's a third act, for all our heroes too band together and fight. It's hard not too notice certain similarities from the A New Hope, and at times feels like It's been done to play things safe after the backlash of the Prequels. The film is also filled a lot of humorous moments as-well, which helps to lighten up some of the darker aspects of the film, although not every joke hits the mark, and occasionally they feel out of place, especially during the the last act of the film.Star Wars the: The Force Awakens is filled with excellent set pieces which immerses the audience back into the universe. We're given enough plot information, and character development to draw us into the the new generation of characters. Whilst some areas feel familiar, there Is a lot too love about this film, watching this In the Cinema was an Incredibly exciting and engaging experience, which had me feeling like a kid watching the original films for the first time and being swept away into a galaxy far, far away. This film has resurrected the Star Wars franchise, and made it one of the must see film experiences of the year.",Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,2488496
2,Sewaat,An Exciting Return to an Amazing Saga,8/10,7 June 2017,"When I go to the movies, I aim to experience one thing: escapism. Even if it's for only two hours, I like to occasionally escape this often unfair world we all live in and lose myself in a fictional adventure. And I think I speak for both the young and the young at heart when I say that Star Wars has brought escapism to audiences all over the globe and for many generations over the past 40 years.I was born in the mid 1990s, so I never had a chance to experience the original Star Wars trilogy on the big screen and this was something that I had a hard time accepting ever since I was a child. I never thought I would be able to see Luke Skywalker, Han Solo or Princess Leia on the big screen ever in my life time. So you can imagine my excitement when I found out that they were making another Star Wars film that was not only inventing an entirely new cast of fresh faced characters, but was also bringing back the cast from the original films, who that of which have not walked on a Star Wars set for over 30 years. So it brings me great delight to be able to tell you that the most recent installment in the franchise did not disappoint.The new characters of the film are all fully developed and come with their own strengths and insecurities. They don't clash with the old cast, but instead melt beautifully with them in every scene. Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac and Adam Driver all do amazingly well. The old cast of course are all stellar too. They slipped back into their respected characters so seamlessly, it feels as though no time has passed at all.I was already familiar with J.J Abrams directing style going into this film. He, once again...does not fail to impress. This film is rife with stunning cinematography. The various locations are as gorgeous as they are aesthetically pleasing. CGI is used in this film, but to my relief it does not overpower the organic and practical effects. The environment in which these characters are staged in feels so authentic and believable, you feel as though you are a part of the journey yourself. It's instantly apparent that this film was made by a man who loves Star Wars just as much as we do.Overall, the film is a triumph. It's a wonderful collaboration of new and old filming techniques that combine beautifully to create the ultimate Star Wars film that everyone can enjoy. It doesn't matter if this is your first experience with the Star Wars saga, or if you've watched all of the films one hundred times over, fans both new and familiar will equally appreciate the love and care that was tirelessly thrown into this dazzling, epic adventure. I anxiously await the next installment.",Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,2488496
3,eve_dolluk,Not perfect but an excellent starter for a future wider scope of the Star Wars Universe,8/10,16 December 2015,"Well first thing is its a whole lot of fun !! I can see what JJ has done here which is to introduce new characters as well as reviving the older ones. This creates a huge nostalgia trip and gives you a very familiar setting. The story is nothing new granted and I can understand avid Star Wars fans who are well versed in the expanded Star Wars universe that may be a bit disappointed. Having said that as a stand alone film it is far from disappointing and for the younger audience this is a new story. The new characters are great, Fin an ex Stormtrooper plays a rather naive young man who is clearly trying to impress the girl Rey. Rey takes the lead however yet Fin is not just a tag along buddy. Rey certainly seems like the most interesting character with the most depth, a scavenger from a desert planet who doesn't know her parents ( sound familiar ) Ren as the bad guy seems more like a petulant child early on who hes a lit of anger issues. Cant say too much more without spoilers although I wish he had kept his helmet on.Poe is the dashing Xwing Pilot as part of the resistance and he is quickly separated from his sidekick BB8. BB8 is a very likable character and is an R2 replacement but slightly cuter.You then have other characters such as supreme leader Snoke, Captain Phasma ( who looks awesome ) and the quite scary General Hux.On top of that Han, Leigha, Luke, Chewie, C3P0 and R2 all return in varying degrees.What we end up with in story terms is a bit of a reboot of a New Hope with slightly different elements. This is not a terrible thing as for older fans its a great nostalgia trip and for newer fans its a great introduction to the Star Wars universe.You will however leave the cinema knowing the previous 6 films wanting more answers as to why things have turned sour again. As a standalone film it works on all levels but is slightly vapid in depth and at times could have done with a slow down in pace.It seems JJ tried to cram as much as possible into one film to move the sage forward, JJ is of course not directing the next instalment so I can see there being a lot more depth in the next 2 films ( plus 2 or 3 more expanded universe films )I just hope that the following films can find some emotion and spirit that is somewhat lacking in the Force Awakens. I will look forward to a second viewing but one thing Force Awakens does do is puts you back in the Star Wars universe with a great big bang !!May the Force be with you !",Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,2488496
4,moviecritichank-7,The Triumphant Return of the Star Wars Saga,9/10,15 September 2017,"In October of 2012, almost five years ago next month, there was an announcement made in regards to Star Wars. George Lucas, the visionary creator of the Star Wars universe, struck a deal with Disney where they would acquire Lucasfilm for around $4.05 billion and that there would be a new Star Wars movie set to be released in 2015. This brought an immense amount of joy and excitement to me as a life-long Star Wars fanatic! For the first time in over ten years, I would be able to see a new Star Wars film on the big screen! From late 2012-early 2013 to several days before it's December 2015 release, I read as many articles I could about pre-production, production, what the movie would actually be about, whether or not material from the Expanded Universe would be the basis for the next trilogy, etc. With that being said, here is my review of the first movie of the sequel trilogy, The Force Awakens. Directed by JJ Abrams (""Star Trek"" 2009), this seventh entry of the Star Wars saga is set thirty years after the Battle of Endor and the defeat of the evil Galactic Empire in Return of Jedi, the galaxy has undergone significant changes. While several of our favorite characters from the original trilogy we grew up knowing and loving such as Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), R2-D2 (Kenny Baker), and C-3P0 (Anthony Daniels) all return, a new generation of heroes and villains are introduced in this episode such as Rey (Daisy Ridley) a scavenger from the planet Jakku (which is very similar to Tatooine with it's desert-like climate), Finn (John Boyega) a former First Order Storm Trooper turned ally of the Resistance, Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) commander of the Resistance starfighters, BB-8, an astromech droid similar to R2, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) Sith Lord in training under Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis), and Captain Phasma (Gwendoline Christie) commander of the First Order of Storm Troopers. In this film, the conflict is centered around the Resistance of the New Republic, (led by General Leia Organa) waging war with the First Order, a legion of Storm Troopers risen from the remaining ashes of the fallen Galactic Empire. In the midst of all of the widespread galactic conflict and turmoil, Leia is also seeking to find her long lost brother, Jedi Master Luke Skywalker, (our hero and main protagonist from the original trilogy that redeemed his father, Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader by bringing him back to the light side and reestablishing balance to the force, fulfilling the prophecy of Anakin/Vader being ""The Chosen One"") who mysteriously went into hiding not long after the events of ROTJ. While not as good as the original trilogy in terms of story, acting, and character development, it still had several strong elements present in the film. Now, I'm going to give what I liked about the movie and where I think (and hope) they can improve in the next two ST entries starting with The Last Jedi in December. Here's what I thought JJ Abrams did a good job of: Unlike Star Trek where he made a lot of changes to the main characters (which is one of the things I feared the most when I found out that he would be directing TFA), I thought that he did a great job of re-introducing our favorite characters and keeping them the same as they were in the OT, just older. I also liked his use of flashbacks, specifically the scene where Kylo Ren is talking to the decaying mask of his grandfather, Darth Vader, by making the claim that as a (future) Sith Lord and leader of the First Order, he will finish what he started with the Galactic Empire. Along with keeping the action consistent throughout the course of the film, I also thought he did a good job of building up the tension towards the climactic showdown at the end. Now, here's what I think they can (and hope) improve on in the next two films: While we all know the backstories of our returning heroes from the OT, the character development was a bit lacking in the new characters introduced in TFA. Rey is basically a ""Mary Sue"" like character (think Wesley Crusher from Star Trek: TNG) in that she's basically presented as being perfect, all strengths and no weaknesses. This frustrated me to no end in one scene where Kylo Ren basically did as he wanted with her blaster when he used the Force on her but, in her duel against him during the film's climax, claiming to have had no Jedi training, they portray her as a ""great"" wielder of the Force that is (somehow) able to defeat him! How does this make sense??? I also hope they flesh out more of Finn and Poe's backstories and I really hope they show more of Captain Phasma in the next movies. I firmly believe she has the potential to be an iconic character in the vein of Darth Maul and Boba Fett. I also hope they cash in on the opportunity they have with Kylo Ren by making him the next great and powerful Sith Lord as he continues to complete his training with Snoke. All of that aside, it was an enjoyable film for me and I can't wait to see how great The Last Jedi will be!!! Rating: 9/10!!!",Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,2488496
5,lnvicta,An exhilarating continuation of the Star Wars saga and an homage to what made it special in the first place.,8/10,18 December 2015,"If there's any movie you should see in theaters, The Force Awakens is it. From the first frame you're sucked right back into the Star Wars universe, and that's probably the best part of the movie - it feels genuinely like Star Wars. Not a child-pandering political farce (The Phantom Menace), a melodramatic soap opera (I'm looking at you Attack of the Clones) or a CGI filled sensory overload (Revenge of the Sith anyone?). No, it's barebones Star Wars. Visually stunning, constantly engaging, and most of all, it's incredibly fun. There are a lot of parallels with A New Hope, like how we're beginning this epic adventure with vastly different characters and learning their stories for the first time. And it shares the basic outline of that movie as well from the monumental opening shot to its massive riveting climax. It's a blast from beginning to end, and especially exhilarating in a packed IMAX theater. The characters are easily relatable from the moment they're shown. Their stories are simple and to the point, allowing the audience to follow them in their journey every step of the way. There's also a lot of humor in the movie, and not the dopey kind either. It's clever and self-referential humor that suits the characters and their motivations while also being damn funny in context.It's hard to put this into words because if you're a fan, you're well aware that watching Star Wars is an experience. There's a rush of being back in the universe and seeing some of your favorite characters again. The threats are even bigger this time around. The First Order is what the Empire has become, led by Supreme Leader Snoke and his apprentice Kylo Ren. At first glance Kylo might seem like a second-rate Vader, but he has much more depth than that. Things are revealed in the movie that piece everything together, and when all is said and done, Kylo Ren is not only a great villain but a great character - charismatic but insecure, arrogant but unexperienced. You can empathize with him at times, but it's obvious there's great darkness within him, and not only because of his haunting mask. The heroes Rey and Finn are immediately likable and easy to root for, and when they start uncovering the bigger picture behind the First Order's sinister plot, they behave exactly as you'd expect them to. Not pompous or valiant but hesitant and curious, at least until their lives are on the line and the only way for them to survive is to band together. Then their inner heroism comes to light.Everything about The Force Awakens is phenomenal - the acting, directing, and writing are all on point, and it serves as a wonderful template for this new Star Wars era. I don't need to spoil anything because the fact is, if you loved the original trilogy you're going to love this. Hell, if you're a fan of good cinema you should love this. Episode VII is what Star Wars fans have been yearning for, and when all is said and done, I couldn't ask for anything more.",Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,2488496
6,Chalice_Of_Evil,"Something, something, something, Dark Side. Something, something, something, complete",9/10,16 December 2015,"It's as if millions of Star Wars fans suddenly cried out in criticism and were suddenly silenced. That's the effect this movie *should* have on most (other than those who'd already decided they were going to be disappointed/hate it no matter what). For all the SANE Star Wars fans out there, I'm happy to report that the Force is strong with this series once again (after taking a walk on the Dark Side with the prequels). All other shoddy imitations take note: THIS is how you do a space opera. The Force Awakens possesses everything that was missing from the soulless prequels: we have a non-snooze-worthy storyline, likable new characters, great acting, non-cringe-worthy dialogue and not such a reliance on only CGI effects/green-screen. The pluses of this movie are in abundance, starting with what's new. All those with reservations about the fresh young actors cast to play new characters Rey and Finn should sit back, relax and watch the beautiful chemistry between the two as their characters form a believable friendship/dynamic on screen like that of the Original Trilogy's trio.Daisy Ridley more than proves she's up to the challenge of having a large portion of the new trilogy rest on her shoulders. Rey is a scavenger with a good heart (as evidenced by her rescuing BB-8, a droid carrying something important). Whilst certain people (who for some unfathomable reason don't like seeing a woman who can handle herself) may take this new female lead (who is smart, brave, kind and just all around awesome) as a personal affront to them, for the rest of us who *don't* hate seeing a woman take centre stage, this is what we've been looking for in a female character for so long. She's everything you could hope for, but not without her faults, as she does make some mistakes (but not enough to hate her for it). She's flawed, but much more interesting because of this. Ridley imbues her character with so much heart/soul, she conveys a lot with just looks and even proves adept at humour as well. Most importantly, she's *likable*, forming instant friendships with other characters who we already like (so we know she's awesome). Any gripes about her would be nitpicky/for petty reasons.Sharing Ridley's responsibility as one of the new faces of this trilogy is John Boyega as Finn, a former Stormtrooper who refuses to go along with the rest in doing something terrible. It's after this that he meets Oscar Isaac's Poe Dameron, who he forms an almost-immediate friendship with. Out of the three new leads, Isaac's Poe is probably given the least development, but he manages to make it believable that he and Finn become close friends in such a short time. The best dynamic, though, is without a doubt the one formed between Rey and Finn. The way they play off each other with such ease is, in large part, thanks to the actors, but also the dialogue being snappy/quick-witted. They share a fun friendship, becoming quite close, and the actors' enthusiasm/energy helps a lot, as they're truly inhabiting their roles/believing in who they're playing as well as the universe they're a part of (where characters talk/act in a unique way). One of many things the prequels sadly lacked was heart, but this movie/these characters have it in spades.Adam Driver's Kylo Ren picks up where Darth Vader left off as our main villain and is clearly devoted to his memory (since he talks to his burned mask). Driver is quite good at playing the bad guy, though he is prone to the occasional 'hissy fit' with his crossguard lightsaber which verges into slightly over-the-top/petulant teenager behavior. Thankfully, when the big moments occur, Driver shows real emotion/conflict within his character. His lightsaber duel, first with Finn and then Rey, is everything the over-choreographed prequel duels were lacking. They may've had the needless fancy twirling and whatnot, but here we have rough and tumble, gritty fights between someone skilled and two people who are only just learning what they're capable of. Plus there's real emotional investment, which helps. It's an epic tension-filled battle, which is a BIG plus with this movie, as we don't know what's going to happen.Naturally, it's good to see our old favourites back (Han, Chewie, Leia, R2-D2, C-3PO, even the Millennium Falcon, all of which received applause at my screening). Those claiming this film relies on nostalgia/good will towards the original films alone are mistaken. Whilst the prequels included familiar characters/moments just for the sake of callbacks, what they do here is much more satisfying. Han is his usual charming, funny, ""scruffy-looking nerf-herder"" self, but he forms attachments to our new characters, and his dynamics with them allows for some of the film's best moments. The movie certainly has humour, but thankfully it's not the ""cutsie"" nauseating variety found in the prequels. There are genuinely funny moments for young and old alike.J.J. Abrams has been unfairly criticised, when he should be receiving thanks. He had the unenviable task of reinvigorating/re-energising the franchise after the prequels nearly killed it and has managed to do so successfully. So what if there's some familiarity? My only quibbles were Domhnall Gleeson's shouty performance and Andy Serkis' CGI Supreme Leader Snoke. In most other instances, Abrams ensured that, along with story/character development, locations/miniatures/practical effects/make-up took precedence over a reliance on CGI/things that simply 'looked cool'. Some familiar musical themes appear on the score, but there are also some new ones which I appreciated were more restrained and not so 'in-your-face' as certain popular themes introduced in the prequels. There is also an abundance of excellent shots throughout the movie; quite a few are instantly iconic. It would be quite the feat for the following films to match this thrilling/exciting and enjoyable/satisfying first chapter of a new era in the saga. If nothing else, at least The Force Awakens easily beats The Phantom Menace in being a great start to a new trilogy of films.",Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,2488496
7,gengar843,A Monument to Mediocrity,6/10,21 June 2016,"From the virtue signaling of social justice, to the cheap-jack plot-line which was easily discerned in advance, to the awful acting which evoked little but hooting from me, I was, as you can see, disappointed, and in some cases outraged. If you dare to join me, I will explain.I have nothing against diversifying the Star Wars universe, which is why I LOVED Star Wars 1, with its Oriental villains, Jamaican Gungan, Jewish scrap dealer, and more. It was a delight of indulgence which fleshed out characters of charm, making the experience vivid and interesting. But after Lucas received flak for ethnic portrayal, Jar-Jar became boring in Star Wars 2. In Star Wars 7, this pandering becomes intolerable. It's fine that Leah has the force, and it's fine that Rey inherited it, but Finn is gratuitous in his race. I would have nothing against this either but they make Finn formidable with a light-sabre against Kylo Ren. And please don't soft-soap me that love gave Finn the strength and skill to take on a pupil of the force - only hate has that power, the dark side. Otherwise, one must be cool and focused. Given this, I dismiss Finn and therefore it irritated me to watch Kylo Ren sword-play with Finn and not simply crush his windpipe with a wave of his hand, or penetrate his mind, which seems to be Ren's forte. As for Kylo vs. Rey, a bit more believable, but it made Kylo seem almost inept. Really? Rey's raw ability with zero training is tougher than Kylo with training? Not even close to believable.What didn't I like about the plot? Well, first, aren't we simply replaying Death Star destruction from the first trilogy? Why, yes we are. And it looks like the Supreme Leader made all the same engineering, logistic, and tactical errors as the Emperor, just on a grander scale, including the convenient ""having to recharge the cannon"" just long enough for the Resistance to ""win the day."" Yawn. Second, much of the plot was geared to exploit the Skywalker/Solo family tree, and there was no thrill to any of it. Darth Vader is Luke's father - WHOA! I jumped out of my seat. Han is Kylo's father? Zzzz. Even if you wanted to say this was a remake, which it's not, it doesn't have the pizazz, never mind the oomph, of the original. But what does? But the acting is where I think I really blew my cool. I can understand characters of convenience, and plot-lines of olde being rehashed, but it has to be acted well to pull it off. Even in Star Wars 3, as sappy as it was, the acting was GREAT, IMO. In Star Wars 7, Harrison Ford is just about limping to his finale, Carrie Fisher looks doddering and not commanding, Daisy Ridley grits her teeth so often I thought she was Red Sonja, John Boyega makes a concerted effort to appear naive at every turn (which makes his good fortune all the more unbearable), Adam Driver does not look torn in the least, and so forth.I can point to hundreds of interesting and thrilling moments from the first six episodes of Star Wars which makes a complete weekend binge-watch, over and over again. Star Wars 7 does not add to that excitement. The tech seems standard, the CGI a little too self-conscious, the nostalgic cheese forced, the push forward too bossy and not natural. Still, I give this film a 6 in the hopes that Star Wars 8 will push the envelope once again.",Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,2488496
8,TheLittleSongbird,The force has awakened!,9/10,1 August 2017,"Loved the original 'Star Wars' films as a kid, still do. Especially 'Empire Strikes Back' while considering 'A New Hope' a genre landmark. Didn't think the prequel films were that bad personally, but they had a lot wrong with them and were a long way from great, especially 'Attack of the Clones'.Despite seeing 'Star Wars: Episode VII- The Force Awakens' around the time it first came out (maybe a little after), there was a long time of being put off by the vitriolic hate it's gotten here and the practical war zone there is in order to review it (even when it was critically acclaimed). Finally mustering the courage, count me in as somebody who loved 'Star Wars: Episode VII- The Force Awakens'. A masterpiece? No. Better than the prequels? Absolutely, and although some may disagree this is saying a lot. The best 'Star Wars' film since 'The Return of the Jedi?' Yes.'Star Wars: Episode VII- The Force Awakens' is not the most original plot-wise. It has been criticised for being a re-hash of 'A New Hope', understandably. However, instead of being done in a cheap and slap-in-the-face way, it felt like an affectionate and nostalgic homage. Exemplified by bringing back major characters from the original trilogy in supporting roles. JJ Abrams, and this may be considered blasphemy, does a much better job here than he did with his 'Star Trek' reboot films, here he keeps the original spirit of the original trilogy intact while giving the film its own identity at the same time.While it certainly dazzles in spectacle and action, 'Star Wars: Episode VII- The Force Awakens' doesn't feel too big, too noisy or too chaotic at the expense of creating memorable characters, a fun story and brains and heart. The characters are memorable with easily identifiable leads, the original trilogy characters bringing a lot of affectionate nostalgia and a well executed if not iconic (not by Darth Vader standards anyhow) villain in Kylo Ren (unpredictable and dangerous but feeling he is morally justified).The story lacks originality but more than makes up for it in energy, non-stop heart-thumping thrills and excitement, generosity, a cheerfulness that is positively space operatic, vibrant charm and a few fresh twists along the way. In many ways it is a celebration of the universe while also an expansion of it. It is sometimes sentimental but never overly so, one crucial death scene is just heart-wrenching (particularly Chewbacca's reaction) and doesn't feel like a slap in the face to the character in question.Could the villains have been better written? Ren is fine but Snoke only just about works as a character thanks to the visual effects and especially the powerfully enigmatic with a touch of vulnerability performance of Andy Serkis, other than that the character is underwritten. Also felt that Gwendoline Christie's character was unnecessary, so limited was her screen time.Visually, 'Star Wars: Episode VII- The Force Awakens' is a triumph. It is gorgeously shot and designed with Abrams' visual storytelling shining far more here than it has in other films he's done. The special effects are a dazzling marvel. John Williams delivers yet another rousing score that has its own character but cleverly includes the well-known iconic themes from the previous films. Thank goodness that the dialogue contains little to none of the cheesiness heard in the prequels, and it even has more layers than that of the original trilogy.Acting also shines, with winning charismatic performances from John Boyega and particularly Daisy Ridley. Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher still have it, while Max Von Sydow shows himself to be a master of gestures and eye contact speaking louder than words. Adam Driver is a suitably menacing Ren and Serkis makes much of his somewhat underwritten character. Oscar Isaac gives a typically strong performance.In conclusion, a great film, the best 'Star Wars' film since 'The Return of the Jedi' and one of the best of the saga too. 9/10 Bethany Cox",Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,2488496
9,RockyMtnVideo,"Watchable for nostalgia factor alone. LK, JJ, et al. should be ashamed of this script.",6/10,3 January 2016,"First the good (no spoilers here.)Rey and Finn: Daisy and John deliver delightful performances, and are extremely likable ""new heroes"", around which to attempt to re-launch this franchise.As mentioned in my title, it's hard to argue with the nostalgia thing. For true fans, it's hard not to have your adrenaline level rise, the instant that John William's score kicks in, followed by the perfunctory crawl, giving us the skinny on what has happened since Episode VI, and as ""old faces"" later begin to make their way into the film, it does start to feel like home.And, in my opinion, that's pretty much the end of the ""good things"".!!!! SPOILERS FOLLOW !!!! !!!! SPOILERS FOLLOW !!!!But now, the badThe problem is that it feels ""just a bit too much"" like home. If we only consider the ""real"" SW trilogy ( episodes IV thru VI), and ignore Lucas' foray into unnecessary special effects craziness (episodes I thru III), then we've now endured three out of four films (counting this new one) where the ""empire"" has constructed planet killing technology, and ""the rebels"" spend the last third of the film concocting an elaborate scheme to discover, and then exploit (with a ""desperate, down to the wire"" effort) the ""design mistakes"" of the empire, in order to ""blow up the planet killer"", and ""save the day"".But for episode VII, it's actually far worse than just that. You pretty much feel like someone took the script from episode IV, and did ""search and replace"" changes in a Word Processor, i.e. the script for VII is pretty much just a ""treatment"" on the IV script:Crash landing on a desert planet at the beginning: ""check"" As yet, unknown, future hero living on that same desert planet: ""check"" (but we'll do a gender change on the ""future hero"");Cute droid (with secret/important message), who finds its way into the hands of the ""future hero"": ""check"";Bar room scene: ""check"" (but we'll move it to a ""forest planet"", instead of a ""desert planet"", so that it ""won't be the same"");""Save the day"" hero with a troubling past: ""check"";Dark-side-related ""father/son problems: ""check"";Rebels infiltrate base, and miraculously disable planet killer ""shields"": ""check"";Hero/pilot makes miraculous attack on planet killer: ""check"";And on and on.I mean jeez nearly 40 years of waiting (since this all started), and the billions that Disney sunk into this franchise, and the best that we can get out of Abrams and Kasdan is a recycled version of ""A New Hope""?Disney needs to remember that the Star Wars franchise isn't heroin, and we are not just a bunch of crazed addicts. Wait maybe I'm completely wrong about that? As it will apparently break every box office record in existence, maybe fans are willing to eat anything that gets doled out, but if that's the case, then that is truly sad (and I guess that they deserve whatever they get).So, I'll go back to my original thought for me (at least), I am not addicted, and I can ""take it, or leave it"". In order to continue buying tickets, I want to see some ""something completely different"". Aside from the core canon, and the requisite characters, somebody is going to need to ""tell me a story"" that won't leave me with another ""been there, done that"" feeling. If I want to see the ""same old story"" again, then I'll just stay at home, and continue to just toss IV thru VI into the Blu-Ray player, and it will be far more satisfying.I really do like the newly introduced characters, and I really do want to see where this franchise might take them, so PLEASE get off your tails and give us a truly original story in VIII that will leave us all begging for this to go on forever.",Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,2488496
10,tinovalkki,Great continuum to Star Wars saga (No spoilers),9/10,16 December 2015,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens steps into a big boots and fills them honorably. The Force Awakens look, feels and sounds like the real Star Wars movie. It contains all the elements that made the original story so epic. It tells an epic story with great scenery and with fine action and adventure. The Force Awakens is like a reboot of an original story, but the same time it is clearly continuation to an original saga. The story and characters are written well. Actors and actresses get through greatly at their roles. No one feels lame or factitious. The story is clearly a tribute to Han Solo, but at the same time it brings new characters well present. Maybe only one thing is not perfect. The story serves background stories of some characters almost too easily and dish out them with no big surprise which made the original movie so epic. The original story was actually a soap opera of one family. There are some elements in this story too, but they are reveled almost too easily. Greatly the story leaves enough of loose ends, so probably we will get bigger surprises of the characters later at upcoming movies.Star Wars: The Force Awakens is loyal to its fans and it lacks of prequels plastic look. It looks familiar, but at a same time it is fresh and interesting. Iconic characters are brought back honorably, but at a same time it tells a new story with new characters. It offer a nostalgic and new epic adventure at same package. Great script offers enough of action and adventure. It almost feels like George Lucas says: ""This is what the Star Wars meant to be"".J.J. Abrams manages to refresh Star Wars saga to present day without forgetting the original fans. It almost feels like I was again that 12 year old boy at 1977, who watched the original story 13 times in two weeks.I watched this movie first time in 2D, but I will watch it again and next time I will see it at 3D, so I will add later to this review how 3D worked in this movie.",Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,2488496
11,comps-784-38265,Oh dear the Force is Weak With This one .,6/10,30 January 2016,"Oh dear what a disappointment ! All the other Star Wars films are part of 'The Saga' adding to and explaining, the original story. How the Empire came about, where Vader came from etc etc. I expected this offering to show 'what happened after'. I expected an exciting original film which would take it's rightful place in the great saga that is 'Starwars'.'The Force Awakens' adds nothing to the saga. Nothing at all, There is nothing original. it just recycles and re-packages the classic scenes from the preceding films. It is a blatant and cynical method of making money from the 'brand'. In fact if you haven't seen any of the previous films you can just watch this one.Darth Vader is now a petulant teen with a different mask and nameHe is no longer Luke's father, He is now Hans Solo and Leia's son.The Evil Empire is now called the New Order The Emperor is now a giant cgi 'Gollum' and nowhere near as sinister or evil. The young Luke Skywalker is now a girl called Rey. A certain droid has vital info for the rebellion (now called the resistance) which is a map that shows the location of a former jedhi knight OB1 Kenobe, now called Luke Skywalker.The evil empire (i mean the 'New Order') has a death star, now rebadged as a planet, with the capability to destroy planets (just like a death star)Hans Solo is let out of his care home to go disable the shields with chewbacca (sound familiar) now accompanied by a renegade storm trooper (who was actually quite a good character but under used) Leia is let out of re-hab to be a general of the resistance (apparently she's no longer royalty) In short they destroy the planet sized re-badged death star, everyone cheers because evil is defeated, and the film ends with Rey discovering the almost mythical Luke Skywalker (who looks a dead ringer for Oliver Reed) Another film where the hype bears no relationship to the substance. The film makers clearly set out to make a lot of money standing on the shoulders of classic films. They achieved their aim and made a lot of money.Sadly the only notable thing about 'The Force Awakens' is that ( by a long long way), it is the worst film of all the Star Wars films. Don't bother paying to see it at the cinema. It will be on TV very soon and be at the Supermarket in the DVD bargain bucket. The Force didn't 'Awaken' for me. It just went back and re-hashed old story lines and characters. Unoriginal, unimaginative, uninspiring. What a shame!How do writers with so little talent, get employment on such big projects?. Seeing the 10 stars reviews I can only assume some are paid to give such glowing reviews. Others must be under the influence of a Jedhi Mind trick (which does effect the weak minded). I presume those giving scores of 1 or 2 are a backlash to this. It is a very mediocre offering and certainly did not live up to my expectations or the hype/advertising around it. 6/10They obviously will be making the follow ups but after this I doubt I will pay to see them. very disappointed.",Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,2488496
12,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"More of a remake than a sequel, it relies on nostalgia and spectacle over actual characters and story.",5/10,10 April 2018,"In essence a remake of 'A New Hope' as opposed to a proper sequel, the check-box resemblance this long-awaited revival shares to its franchise's debut is genuinely uncanny and sadly staggering since this was the perfect opportunity to try something new considering that the 'Star Wars' moniker is a powerful enough box-office draw to recoup any budget, apparently no matter how exorbitant, and withstand more than a few bad apples (*cough* the prequels *cough*). What's here in 'Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens (2015)' is based on nothing more than nostalgia, a series of slightly sickening ""remember this thing""'s and ""this guy still looks the same but he's grey now""'s that become incredibly tiresome increasingly quickly. If you take away the franchise underlayer you're just left with a hollow, characterless piece that gives you no reason to care and very little actual information despite all its endless exposition. In the end, I was honestly bored even during all of its high-flying fanfare. 5/10

13,drewcollins-70255,Best Star Wars Yet - which will please both virgins and vets.,10/10,11 September 2017,"How do you please franchise fans old and new while making a good, impactful and memorable movie? Do exactly what JJ Abrams did here, to a tee. My friends, real fans who grew up with the original trilogy and watched this one with me, expressed a physically relief of feeling there was very little to complain about and that ""'they' didn't mess it up"", but my feeling was even more positive. They exceeded my high expectations, brought me into a mysterious and magical voyage and left me wanting more until the last frame. A real cinematic experience.Star Wars formula could be deemed to appeal to simplicity (like good vs evil) with a few twists. Fun fact and contingent to the same doctrine, the majority of its meaningful characters name limit themselves to 3 or 4 letters: Han, Luke, Leia, Yoda and now Rey, Poe and Finn. If not letters, we can substitute numbers: R2D2, C3PO or BB8.Well, we can now focus on 2 letters: JJ. JJ Abrams directs and co-writes this brilliant installment in the multi-billion dollar franchise which set ridiculous revenues after a record-breaking first day (not counting merchandise and video sales)It also comes with extremely favourable critics and has started an epic new trilogy as well as spin-offs we all hope will continue to remain a high level of quality such as Rogue One already did incredibly. But back to this highly anticipated sequel which manages to create nostalgic moments with its characters, settings and story. Every Star Wars Fans will enjoy the scenery of a defunct Star Destroyer in the desert, but overall cinematography and scenery is in fact the best of all the Star Wars by its beauty and diversity. We get sultry desert in Jakku like Tatooine and forest like Endor. We get beautiful snow that surpass Hoth, buildings and water like Naboo and idyllic Irish-like islands. Daniel Mindel is the cinematographer who also did marvels with JJ on the first 2 Star Trek reboots. Every battle scene is sweeping and spectacular with many elements, motion and emotion. Humour is effective and tension is well crafted and augmented by sound, music and editing.Here Abrams outdoes himself by keeping it crisp with new likable and believable characters, great acting and superb directing to keep everything flowing and fans following. We feel for the characters, old and new. We are intrigued and we do not want it to end. A pretty much perfect movie of the genre and for a new generation, with Rey a particular stand-out.Han and Leia were not only there for older fans, but make it work as very important elements to the story. The writing and directing for them is just right, like the rest of the movie. Award-worthy, action-packed, well-paced, high expectations delivered and then some.It's decisively the best Star Wars yet, and that is no small feat. One small step for a fan, but a giant leap for longevity and quality!Rian Johnson has some SERIOUS shoes to fill for Episode 8.10/10",Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,2488496
14,jodimiller-85863,Star Wars The Force Awakens succeeds across the board!,10/10,26 August 2017,"As I followed the production process of Episode 7, I was looking for evidence that they were holding to ideals hopefully wayyyyyyy better than Lucas' prequel trilogy.Going into the new film, I was mostly concerned with them capturing the look and feel of the original movies. I determined that if they got that right, the story could be appreciated more. Since they got Lawrence Kasdan (writer of the Empire Strikes Back, my favorite movie) on board with writing credits along with JJ Abrams and Michael Arndt (both huge Star Wars fans), I was less concerned with the story they wrote than they means they chose to convey it. I was a little concerned about the reprisal of characters from the original trilogy that are WELL ON in years, but I didn't put much thought into it because I knew the story wasn't going to be about them.I'm happy to say: JJ ABRAMS AND CO DID NOT LET US DOWN.They built real sets and props, by hand, but weren't afraid to lean on the use of digital technology as needed. The result is a movie filled with gritty, organic places that just plain and simple...feel real. The digital effects, are soooooooo good too. Easily the most real-looking lightsaber effects I've ever seen.The newest cast members are FANTASTIC. The older actors really shine through as well, a lot more than I thought, honestly. Especially Harrison Ford, he really manages to still capture the same spirit that makes him Han Solo, despite being considerably older. The new story raises plenty of questions as well, really setting the stage for the following films and what's to come. But, as I've hinted at, I'm thoroughly satisfied with the film on the look and feel alone. Let's also not forget NEW STAR WARS MUSIC. The newest John Williams score is fantastic, and is essential to capturing the magic of what Star Wars feels like. I give it a 10/10, though I can understand some people giving it a high 8 or 9/10.",Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,2488496
15,alexferranti,Star Wars is back with vengeance no matter what Negatives say.,10/10,24 April 2017,"Too many people give this a negative because of ""rehashes of A New Hope"" Well A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back aren't even original to begin with. If we hate The Force Awakens for being unoriginal then use the same logic not only against the original trilogy itself but also Disney classics like THE LION KING. Negatives are also given because apparently Rey is a ""Mary Sue"" People don't seem to pay attention enough to The Original Trilogy if they don't think Luke resembles similar ways. Id like to know more about Rey in The Last Jedi. Her character is EXTREMELY well done. She is incredibly relatable and compassionate. Finn is an amazing character with great enthusiasm and excellent morals. No need for a reason to help someone. Its the right thing to do. Only use violence as Last Resortand Finally.... If I were to be honest.... When you hear ""He was the Best Star Pilot in the Galaxy"" I now think of Poe Dameron! he's a Badass! Reason? He destroyed 10 Tie fighters and 3 stormtroopers in 16 seconds. I love his passion for flying too even if its a bad guy StarFighter! ""I always wanted to one of these things!"" I honestly almost cried at the scene where *SPOILER ALERT* Rey found Luke. Its like finding a best friend of relative you haven't seen for years or decades. I left the theaters with insane chills. I can't decide a favorite character to be honest.... I love them all. Their acting is incredibly believable. While it does have its flaws (What movie doesn't?) I still could NOT have loved it more! (Only thing I didn't like is that Captain Phasma was wasted. Hopefully she is given more in The Last Jedi.",Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,2488496
16,jaredkelsch,This IS the sequel you're looking for,10/10,31 August 2017,"Words cannot describe the perfection that is this film. JJ Abrams did a fantastic job, better than anything Lucas could. Solid cast, action, effects, everything. I'm still stuck on deciding which is better between this and The Empire Strikes Back, which speaks for itself. Go see this film, even if you're not a Star Wars fan, you will become one. I cannot wait to see the future of Star Wars in Episodes 8, 9 and all the spin off movies. And thankfully, there isn't any Jar Jar Binks or young Anakin Skywalker. Instead we have interesting, diverse and excellently played characters.What a film!",Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,2488496
17,ssvfolder-1,On a path of destruction,6/10,24 March 2016,"Ever since I was a kid, I loved this franchise. Even episode 1, by far the worst in the series, had that ""star-wars feel"". Mostly thanks to great casting of Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor, awesome new dark side character and dual light saber. So despite extremely high expectations, the series wasn't ruined and effectively picked up in dark episode 3. Then Disney followed up with this one, with J.J.Abrams at helm, which once again rose the expectations. Well it's not good. Especially the casting and acting of younger stars. Even Harrison Ford and Chewy can't save this mess. It may be a blasphemy, but unfortunately Ford can't pull off ' ""the cool"". Sorry guys, he's a bit too old, so some action scenes look out of place. The casting of young stars was atrocious. Simply bad. Bad chemistry, Bad looks (ecpecially the Kylo Ren character), badly choreographed fights, Bad everything. On top of which, Abrams took the period as a remake of original which should not be touched! At all. Due to stunning (as expected) visuals, and a personal love to the universe, this movie can be watched, but if this awful trend continues, even special effects and millions of fans won't be able to save the series.",Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,2488496
18,jesswilson-33283,"All of the best parts of the Original Trilogy, with none of the cheese!",10/10,10 November 2017,"The film is easily the best written of the entire franchise; with clever, witty dialogue (for the first time in the series history). It also has the most humanity, and thoughtful drama. It's surreal seeing Han, Luke, Leia, Chewbacca, and other original cast members, on the big screen again (in a new movie); and I think it was justifiable asking Fisher and Hamill to lose weight, for their parts (it's necessary to the roles they're playing). The new characters are also extremely likable, and soon to be classic, as well. Ridley is a revelation, and I think she rivals Jennifer Lawrence; for one of the best performances of the year! Driver, Boyega and Isaac are all fantastic as well; and Ford is, once again, classic! The movie (without question) deserved several Oscar nominations; for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, acting and more. The approach Abrams takes, to the material, is exactly right (it's traditional, old fashioned filmmaking). The film is everything you could possibly expect (or want) from a 'STAR WARS' movie; it's funny, heartfelt, touching and action- packed. It's far and away the best film in the series since Empire Strikes Back.The perfect TEN!",Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,2488496
19,culmo80,JJ Abrams is overrated,6/10,9 April 2016,"I was pessimistic when I learned JJ Abrams was going to be taking on Star Wars. While he was ""successful"" in the reboot of the Star Trek films, he seems incapable of directing a film without a contrived plot that is about as coherent as something written by a 5th grader.Okay, I had no problem having Finn crash land and run into Rey and BB-8. It's everything after that. Amazing that the Millennium Falcon just happens to be on the same planet in the same village that these two need to escape from. Amazing that they get picked up in space by non other than Han Chewy. Amazing that Han and Chewy decide to take them to the same backwater world where there is a wise ... individual who just so happens to have Anakin/Luke's lightsaber. Yeah, I get it, the Force works through everything, but come on. This isn't the Force at work. We've seen this sort of collection-of- coincidences-equals-plot in the Star Trek reboots. When looked at with a critical eye, this sort of plot is about as sturdy as a cardboard box in a hurricane.The rest of the story was pretty simple. There's a giant planet- destroying base (quite original) and it's going to destroy the Resistance. This is the third such super-weapon plot device in the Star Wars franchise. They've ceased to become impressive, especially given how easily they are destroyed.And the characters? Han Solo ... the best you could do was make the hero of the Galactic Civil War reverting back to a smuggler? It's like his character did absolutely no evolving in the 33ish years since we first met him at that cantina. Rey was fine, but I think we all sort of can predict her future. Why not giving us her full name or showing us who her parents were, that means you're hiding something. I wouldn't be surprised if she is a Skywalker. What a great story to pit two descendants of Anakin against one another? Finn. A bit over the top, and it didn't necessarily fit in with the Star Wars universe. They should have toned down his character a bit. Kylo Ren. Not bad. I think everyone was expecting a Vader clone and we got a guy who is still learning. Captain Phasma. Who? Everyone got excited about the chrome stormtrooper. All she did was walk around issuing orders and then get taken prisoner. That stormtrooper with the shock stick thing was more of a bada^^ than Phasma. General Hux. Definitely not on par with previous villains. Too young. They could have cast a much older actor and the role would have done better.I'm glad that Abrams ISN'T running the next installment. Maybe we'll get more story--a more complete story",Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,2488496
20,greglanford,......TEN,10/10,8 October 2017,"A fantastic addition to the Star Wars series!Great story, excellent acting, brilliant action, and so on.The photography was sweeping and excellent. The characters were imaginative and fresh. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and would watch it again without hesitation.The plot was easily the best of the entire series and the cast were all outstanding in their parts.I truly look forward to the next installment and hope J.

21,Ben_Horror,"Not too long, long ago in a galaxy not too far, far away... two guys, Larry and JJ, were sitting in an office trying to write a script...",6/10,28 January 2016,"JJ: I just can't crack the script, Larry. I can't.Suddenly there is a knock at the door: it's George Lucas.GEORGE: Hey, guys, I have an idea-
JJ: Not now, Georgie boy.George Lucas exits.JJ: So what am I doing wrong here, Larry?LARRY: You're approaching it the wrong way, Jj. What I propose is we essentially rewrite the first movie Georgie boy made back in '77.JJ: He will be very annoyed if we do...
LARRY: Who cares - he lost his rights to be annoyed when he sold to Disney. Retooling the first movie is the way to go, I'm telling you.JJ: it's a revolutionary thought, Larry - do you think it can work?LARRY: Duh, yes! But we must update it for the 21st century, addressing all those aspects that annoyed people back in the day. For example, let's have another Luke Skywalker type character going on a hero's journey, but this time we will make her female.JJ: That will bring in the ladies!LARRY: Yes and we can really pander to them by having her remarking that no one needs to be holding her hand and pulling her out of danger! They will like that! And she can have latent Jedi powers
JJ: Oh, my - toy sales will be doubled!LARRY: What's another common complaint? The lack of black people. The one black guy there is, well, he betrays Han Solo. So let's make the second major character in the movie black. Let's make him a Stormtrooper... but a good one. He's basically gone rogue.JJ: And that Poe Dameron guy we discussed - he can be our new Han Solo!LARRY: But didn't you say you want to bring Harrison back?JJ: Oh shoot Yeah you're right! I guess we can just have Poe disappear off the screen until Solo dies? People won't notice it cos they will be so caught up in the magic of Star Wars! What about a villain?LARRY: Easy - we will just conjure up another masked Darth Vader type. Might be a good idea if they want to make a prequel trilogy further down the line showing his origins. He will be part of a sinister movement like the Empire.JJ: I know - The First Order!!!LARRY: Brilliant! But where will they come from and how do they get to power - considering the evil has been vanquished at the end of Return of the Jedi?JJ: Larry, we don't need to explain all that - the magic of Star Wars, remember. People will be so caught up in the space battles they won't even question it. But we will need a poignant Obi Wan-type death sequence moment.LARRY: Here's what we could do: make this masked villain Han Solo's son and and he could be the one who kills Solo! There's your poignant death scene just like the first one!JJ: That's astounding! I'm tearing up here right now just thinking about it!LARRY: Where exactly will Luke Skywalker fit into all this?JJ: We can have him being a hermit on an island at the end. The plot could be about a map inside a cute little R2D2 type robot and they're trying to find it.LARRY: Find the map and they find Luke Skywalker! Yes! But why does he leave a map to his location?JJ: Who cares - that's the magic of Star Wars! We can explain it in the next one!LARRY: And if you're putting another robot into this, what will we do with R2D2?JJ: Good question I guess we could put him asleep in the corner? As in on standby?LARRY: For the entire movie?JJ: Yeah, why not. People won't even question it.LARRY: This First Order group is going to need another massive weapon...
JJ: What about... another Death Star-type thing?LARRY: Is that not a bit similar, though?JJ: Well, Georgie boy got away with using the Death Star twice, so surely we can too? But it can be much bigger. They could have actually hollowed out a planet this time.LARRY: Good idea. I still feel we need another black actor somewhere in the mix. But it must be a respected one.JJ: But who can they play? All the human roles are taken!LARRY: You're not thinking outside the box, Jj! What about having a brand new Yoda type character created through CGI? I think the story will need it, anyhow. He or she could play that?JJ: But what's the point in casting a respectable actor and then obscuring them by CGI? That makes no sense.LARRY: But an extra ethnic actor's name will look good in the cast list!JJ: You know what, you're right!LARRY: We've yet to sort out the Princess Leia character.JJ: Stick her in some of the tactical scenes, doing the same stuff she did in the first trilogy. That'll take care of her.LARRY: And the whole movie could end in a climatic light-saber battle where the heroine fights the lead villain.JJ: What will the ex-storm trooper be doing during all this?LARRY: He can get injured and be unconscious.JJ: But shouldn't he pick up the light-saber too?LARRY: No - he's a Stormtrooper, silly!JJ: But if we go to all this trouble of putting in a black lead, people will complain that the black man still doesn't get to handle the Light-saber at the end of the movie.LARRY: Sam Jackson did in the prequels.JJ: But he was a Jedi!LARRY: Jj, you are right! Granted, it won't make any sense in the context of the story, but you're right! Let's have him pick up the light-saber and engage in battle! That's how he gets injured!JJ: I think we have the makings of a blockbuster, Larry!!! Let's go out and throw tennis balls at George to celebrate!",Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,2488496

Remember how they inspired a generation of loyal fans? Remember how they virtually saved cinema from terminal audience decline in the 70s? So scoot forward 40 years, and see the empty soulless rubbish lapped up by brainwashed Pavlovian audiences and critics. How much did Disney pay the critics for all those gushing reviews? Either that or the art of film criticism has been lost.Lucas may be $4 billion richer but I bet he wishes he hadn't sold the rights. Star Wars will now be forced down your throat, hyped beyond hype, new toys every month. The dollars will keep rolling in.This movie is just a total rip off of the original trilogy; nothing original in it all. It sucks the joy out of this franchise. It revels in the stupid. A Death Star that can't go anywhere, A Death Star whose Death Ray is faster than light (how else can it reach those systems in seconds?) Luke Skywalker. Hero for millions all over the world. Here he has run away. People who can become master Jedi without training. Poe's amazing reusable jacket - which he should still be wearing when Fin picks it up. A hundred other mistakes and holes. Yep. Thanks Abrahams.Han Solo. One of the most beloved cinema icons of all. Written out because a bored actor wants another Indiana Jones Movie. Princess Leia. Or what passes for Princess Leia. Just sad. All the original cast are basically guest stars in their own franchise, so we can have a younger generation take over and keep milking the cash for another 40 years.Ah, yes, JJ. himself. Started out as a Spielberg hack, became a Roddenberry hack, now a Lucas hack. Yep, a third-rate hack all round. This guy has ruined more franchises then anyone I can think of.This is the future of modern cinema. And you're welcome to it.

24,samphillips-38315,"Yes, it really is that good.",10/10,23 September 2017,"This movie does everything right. Right from the start, I was sucked into the story. There are so many ways this could have gone wrong, and I'm so glad they did it right.I was afraid that perhaps the new characters would not grow on me, but fortunately that wasn't the case. Finn's role is just perfect, plus it allows the movie to give the audience more insight into the structure of the empire, and what being a Storm Trooper is all about. This is the world building I was talking about earlier. The movie answers a lot of questions, even the simple ones. Rey is also a great character, but the exact opposite of Finn. Plus I really enjoyed the way the movie dispels common damsel in distress tropes with her. I think Rey's character makes the Star Wars universe more accessible to a young female audience, and that thought makes me smile a little. The movie does its best to show us that Rey is perfectly fine at saving herself.The opening shot of the original Star Wars had its audience literally ducking in their seats, and thus succeeded at making you feel the oppressive rule of the empire with a mere visual. But The Force Awakens nails that too. Rather than steal those shots, they have new shots to achieve the same thing. A lot of the shots of imperial ships are shot at an angle from below, so they look really big.The special effects in this are also amazing. There is so much use of real sets and practical effects. Tons of creatures are puppets, animatronics, or suit- characters. -Even some of the really big creatures are puppets, I suspect. This makes the world look real. Sure, when it comes to big battle scenes there is also liberal use of CGI. I also really like the way they show the interior of various ships, and show how the technology works. It makes it all feel real.Plot wise, the movie succeeds at making the First Order feel threatening, by showing the cruelty of the empire early on. This is something that the old movies never really succeeded at. They always made the Storm Troopers look like bumbling cannon fodder, -but not so in this movie. They also have some fun with the villain, which is welcome. He isn't just some two dimensional character.Another thing that surprised me, is how they expand on the lore of The Force. We get to see new ways in which the Force can be used, and they focus more on the mystical elements of it, and don't even mention the midichlorians from the prequels. And we get to see the Force being used a lot. If you think about it, Darth Vader didn't use the Force all that much in the original trilogy, and neither did Obi Wan. But in the Force Awakens, we see liberal use of it.If you have children you owe it to them to take them to this movie. I mean it. Take them to this movie right now! They will love you for it! Come on! And if you are still a child at heart, then go see it as well.",Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,2488496

Wake up spammers with boring lives, This is STAR WARS driven by the best part of the force. I consider this a continuation of brilliance at its finest. You people that endlessly cry about this movie did actually see it, right? LOL Can't wait to see this story continue for years to come. This has made me an even bigger fan of Star Wars. I thought the acting was top notch, especially Harrison Ford, he stepped right back into that role perfectly.Enjoy an amazing movie for exactly what it is.........AMAZING!

27,Bogie27,Please Disney - don't do this again!!!,6/10,1 February 2016,"Why another less than superlative review? It's the movies I guess - or Hollywood. There is a good one planned shortly to make up - I promise.Long before this film arrived I claimed you couldn't do Star Wars over. This Disney remake has proved me right. It leaves me wondering if walking away from Lucas was a good thing to do. It's true he overreached himself with the prequels and botched the whole thing. But they could have done better with a proper director and screenwriter. Lucas had the vision, there's no doubt about that.Back to this film: I'm scratching my head. On the one hand it feels like a total remake of the first film with a few corny exceptions.After the last scene, I had to wonder if maybe there WAS a story sweep coming out of all this rehashed mess. Something original perhaps. That would be nice.That's the reason I advise Disney to never do this again. If they want to utilize Star Wars in their theme parks, well that's fine. Just don't ruin a classic syfy saga to do it.",Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,2488496

It's also an extremely popular and mainstream movie, and therefore is going to bring out raging nerds that will needlessly nitpick it to death in an attempt to look smart or edgy. There are legitimate criticisms you can hurl at this or any movie, but people that give it a 1 or 2 out of 10 shouldn't be taken remotely seriously, as they are completely ignoring what the movie did right, and putting a magnifying glass over the irrelevant level of minor flaws included. Normal Star Wars fans will find a lot to like hear. Great set pieces/locations, excellent costume design, flawed and relatable characters, hilarious banter/quips, dramatic and complex relationships, and a ton of space adventure fun!It's the best Star Wars film since Empire, hands down.",Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,2488496
29,BA_Harrison,Episode VIII had better be fantastic.,6/10,24 December 2015,"A fairly long time ago, in a county not so far away (Elstree Studios are an hour's drive away from yours truly), a great adventure took place. Now, J.J. Abrams, in league with the 'House of Mouse', has returned to make a seventh chapter in the franchise, and it's almost identical in plot to the first film, but with only a fraction of the magic and charm.Daisy Ridley plays Luke sorry, I mean Rey a scavenger on the desert planet of Tatooinesorry, I mean Jakku who becomes involved in the rebellion against The Empire sorry I mean The First Order after she bumps into R2D2 sorry, I mean BB-8, a droid carrying plans to the death star sorry, I mean to the whereabouts of Luke Skywalker. Meanwhile, the First Order are preparing their new weapon, the Death Star sorry, I mean Starkiller Base for use against the rebellion, who are forced to launch a risky counter-attack that sees Rey coming face-to-face with masked villain Darth Vadersorry, I mean Kylo Ren (Adam Driver).I've learnt to keep my expectations low for Star Wars films since The Phantom Menace, so I can't say The Force Awakens was a massive disappointment; it is what I feared it would be—a rather safe reboot, lacking in fresh ideas, which aims to please younger viewers with flashy visuals, whilst pandering to the older generation by including sly nods to the original trilogy. Personally, I would much rather they had taken a bolder approach: let's be honest they couldn't have got it any more wrong than the prequels.There's a spark of originality in the form of Finn (John Boyega), a stormtrooper who has a change of heart and joins the rebellion, the production design and effects are incredible, and I admit that the return of Han Solo and Chewbacca warmed even my cynical heart, but on the whole I was left wanting by this latest instalment, particularly the final assault on the Starkiller Base, which was completely bereft of tension. In fact, my favourite moment of the whole film is when Carrie Fisher tries to convey anguish, but her plastic surgery doesn't let her.",Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,2488496
30,morganstokes,Beyond Incredible! (Especially Compared To The Laughably Overrated Originals),10/10,23 September 2017,"My expectations were very, very high for this movie.Starting with the opening scene, a typical Star Wars opening, I wondered how well it was done. I wondered how it would be different and yet new, rebooting some of the old and original without seeming stagnant.JJ delivered on the Star Trek reboot and he absolutely nailed this one as well.He made it his own movie, he engaged original characters by engaging the new and the old. He let the characters tell their own stories without pushing over the boundaries. The story flowed.John Williams does it again. Harrison Ford was spectacular. The newcomers were fun, engaging and ""cheer"" worthy.My only complaint is this: do I really have to wait 2 more years to see the next amazing one directed by Abrams?!Someone pass me the Xanax while I wait, please!!!",Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,2488496
31,eventtreight,"Nothing to see here, move along....",6/10,6 January 2016,"I cannot believe that a supposed Star Wars fan of a director would think that this story was worthy to succeed the originals chronologically. Not only was the story unoriginal but cliché as well.You would think someone like JJ Abrams, who did a fantastic job with Star Trek, would put as much or more energy into this, but alas, it felt as if they they did not put much thought behind the script. Even the dialogue itself felt clumsy and awkward most of the time.There are countless stories written by comic book authors that would make excellent scripts, its too bad more directors of existing franchises don't pay more attention to the literature that already exists instead of reaching...flimsily, for content.",Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,2488496
32,sonofhades,"It is not a sequel, but a remake",4/10,16 December 2015,"Sad but true. When the opening credits filled the screen (Episode VII... blah blah) I was already grinding my teeth because the plot sounded idiotic. Then the huge star destroyer filled the screen. The fun bit is that the star destroyer had some sort of antenna or whatever at the front and it looked liked the ship was showing the middle finger towards the viewers. I have to congratulate the film makers as that was pretty much how the film worked from that point forward. 1) A droid has important information that must be delivered to the good guys (Episode IV, anyone?)2) so the bad guys hunt for the droid on a desert planet (IV) 3) Storm troopers raid a village, killing everyone (IV) 4) A girl is captured by the bad guys and the good guys rush to the base to the rescue. (IV) 5) The girl and the boy have a friend zone relationship through the film (Ep IV, Luke & Leia, wouldn't be surprised to learn that they are siblings in Episode IX) 6) The stormtroopers, elite soldiers of the bad guys, still can't hit a barn door. On the other hand, the good guys always hit, even when they use a weapon for the first time in their life 7) Supreme Leader Snoke = Emperor with a silly name 8) The bad guys have a magnificent new weapon that can destroy planets (Ep IV) 9) They use it to destroy a planet loyal to the rebels (IV) 10) The weapon has shields that can be destroyed by going down on the planet and disabling the shield generator (VI) 11) The epic villain wears a mask that distorts his voice (IV) and sadly, looks better with the mask on than without it.12) The good guys can only destroy the weapon with an attack by X-Wings on the exact target (IV) 13) The X-Wings have to fly in a tight trench in order to reach their target (IV)The screen writers had absolutely no new ideas to show for their money. A bunch of monkeys could have written better dialogue. A 1st grader could have made a plot that had less holes in it. The special effects were pretty much of the same quality as in the first Star Wars movie that was released 1977. I'd expect something way better in 2015.",Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,2488496

To have just enough fresh material meshed so fluidly with the old stuff everyone loves is a truly amazing feat.I've read countless reviews that say this movie has lost all heart and doesn't feel like a Star Wars movie and the answer to that is simply........wrong.From glorious dogfights to scene stealing droids to gritty lightsaber battles this movie has everything I want in a Star Wars film. And more! There are some real moments of raw emotion too that I think the Prequels tried to instill but just couldn't.The plot is perfection, the new characters had perfect chemistry with the old, the effects were even more mind blowing than the trailers led to me believe, etc etc etc Please don't even bother reading any laughable negative reviews, simply see this spectacle for yourself.10",Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,2488496

J.J. Abrams and Lawrence Kasdan have accomplished what I thought to be impossible: they have resurrected the Star Wars franchise with more life and vigor than ever. From a beautiful story to crackling dialogue that doesn't take itself overly serious, this film is brimming with everything we ever loved about Star Wars. The acting is better than we've ever seen it, with our returning cast, specifically Harrison Ford churning out their best performances yet. My favorite part of the film, however, are the new players. All of the young cast, specifically Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley stun in their respective roles. This film plays as a love letter to fans, and while it's impossible to please everyone in the internet age, as a man who loved the original trilogy long before the prequels, I can assure you that if you consider yourself a real Star Wars fan, you will fall in love with this film. I implore you to see it multiple times. It's gotten better every single time. It's now tied with Empire as my favorite Star Wars film. This film will stand the test of time for generations to come. Thank you J.J. and Kasdan for this gem of a trilogy kickoff!",Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,2488496
35,aponx,First Star Wars since 1980 that didn't suck!,10/10,13 September 2017,"Don't mistake continuity of story and universe with ""reboot or rehash"" - This is a story that continues on from the end of Return of the Jedi"". We are not worried about The Force being explained anymore, we don't care - It's a mystery and back to being a mystery. It starts with a simple enough premise: The Empire was defeated and their end Death Star obliterated, but as always, in fiction as in true life, when old bad guys are killed off, new bad guys take their place.This is not a universe that is ""in the same condition as it was in Eps IV, V, and VI"" - As there is a new republic, there is also a new group of imperialists and fascists that want to tear it down. It's happening in the US this very day, so this is nothing new.The main thing here is ""Where is Luke Skywalker"" - And both bad guys and good guys want to know the answer to this. So do We. These include some of the old regulars, plus a new bad guy who wears a Helmet that looks like the Ugly Narc-Alien from Episode IV, who narced on Hans Solo to Imperial Storm Troopers and particularly Jabba the Hut. In an early confrontation in this episode, this duck faced guy takes out Max Von Sydow who indicates this person came from the Good side of the Force.So to me it's just continuity, as there are Jedi who followed Luke and his mentor Obi-Wan, any new recruit that goes down the Dark Side ends up doing Darth Vaderish things, like killing Off a whole school of Jedi Kids.As in life with often repeated scenarios, that keep on repeating over and over, this is just the same in the Star Wars universe. I'm not worried about that, what's important here is ""Does this film play out like original Star Wars""? And yes, it does.And although this film includes people from Eps 4, 5, and 6, this is a new story, and so there are two new players, a girl, who is waiting on a crummy sand planet, and a storm trooper, who turns away from his programming because he wants something better. And there is something about this Kid, do we know *his* father?The imagery is pure original Star Wars. The gadgets, the Droids, the Crashed Imperial Destroyers. New and Old Aliens, in new and old Bars.I very much wanted to know who this girl was, and I very much wanted to know about this kid who walked away from being a storm trooper. In the Meantime, it was great to see Han, Chewie, and Leia, who have scars of age and experience. At one time, they were the young ones who had the responsibility laid on them, in this episode, it is the girl and the boy. Because in real life it is always the young choosing to do good, who have long term effects, who save Nations in some cases. It's generational, the old guard passes it on the the new guard. If you live in this world, you're feeling the change of the guard - As the old song says.That's what this episode is, although there is a major victory, it is at major cost. And although the old Empire had built two powerful Death Stars, those were nothing compared to a new threat. It's a death star on steroids. So some ask, why make new Death Stars? Why have one in this movie? Because, it's the limited thinking of The Imperialists and Fascists. Because they always go back to comfortable norms for weapons design- In their Supreme Leader's small thinking, another huge planet sized weapon with a huge GUN.I saw this in IMax, in 3D, and I was impressed with how each 3D gag was well thought out and well placed. My brother kept trying to reach out and touch the tip of the Imperial Destroyer. A film shot in 3D has to look good also in 2D, and this does, in the IMax theater I could occasionally pull off my glasses and see a 2D Scene, and the composition in 2D was just as good. I'm not really a fan of 3D films, you can't really call them films anymore, as they are made on all digital medium. But for this episode, it worked well.In Lucas's overblown Eps I II and III, the CGI was over the top and blatantly CGI. IN this film, the CGI blends with the practical elements so that you absolutely cannot tell which is which. And also in Eps I II and III we have a multitude of scenes which are boring discussions explaining the force, mainly people sitting on couches talking. That, to me is about exciting as eating a plate of Tripe! I guarantee you, you will NOT see any Jedi sitting on couches talking in this one. Or Senators, or Sith Lords. This film is action from start to finish- about 2 and a half hours worth.And after walking out after the last scene and the film credits, there is no way in hades or Tattoine, that this will not have sequels. And this episode deserves to have sequels. And I for one cannot wait for those to come out!",Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,2488496
36,tpwright-38864,Greatest movie of all time,10/10,18 September 2017,"So, my opinion of this movie is that it is the ""greatest movie of all time."" WHY? Let us get started. Number One: This movie is the first one to be in Sphero's ""Watch with me"" features with its BB-8. If you have a BB-8 from Sphero, you get what I mean if you have iPhone 5s or later. Number Two: The music by John Williams is FANTASTIC! I am so mad at the Academy that it did not give John Williams and Oscar for his music!!!!! This movie is his 50th Oscar nomination! WHY THE HELL DID THEY NOT GIVE HIM AN Oscar!?!?!?!??!?!Number Three: The old characters finally return. Bad news, is that George Lucas is not there to help make it, so that is a bit a problem that does not matter. Number Four: This movie is similar to Star Wars: A New Hope.Number Five: Daisy Ridley's performance as Rey is GREAT! Even though she is not my favorite person, she really got her talent through and she made the production quicker. I agree with some people that she is fun to watch.Those are the five main reasons why this movie is the greatest movie of all time.

37,jb_campo,Nothing special except the old gang,6/10,21 August 2016,"If you were expecting something different and better, you will be disappointed with SW7, Force Awakens.The plot seems pretty similar to the previous plots. This young girl Rey seems to have something special. Could she have special Jedi powers? Who is this guy Finn and why did he leave the troopers? It was comfortable to see Chewie and Hans Solo, like putting on a nice comfortable, well- work jacket. But there are chase scenes, and a bad guy who is eerily similar to Darth Vader, with again the father/son angle thrown in. Fighter jets attack a big bad warship. The computer robot has a special role. Does this all sound familiar? Oh, and at the end you are left hanging, knowing that the franchise will continue. Same old same old.Star Wars 7 was nothing special, except the hype, and seeing Harrison Ford again. Otherwise, I think this bridge to the next generation of SW fans might just be a bridge too far. Stick with the Star Trek movies - they are more enjoyable that this retread.",Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,2488496
38,harryparkes-92758,Far and way the greatest film of 2015!,10/10,31 August 2017,"Star Wars The Force Awakens is a beautiful film. It's the Star Wars film that we've been waiting for for 30 years, the film that the prequels failed to deliver. It is full of gorgeous visuals, memorable characters, and genuinely funny lines but above all, it truly felt like how a Star Wars movie should feel. Wildly entertaining, at no point during the film did I feel removed from the action, or that I was waiting for the next scene to happen. The movie is very fast paced, with very few slow moments. That being said, the action flows together perfectly and somehow manages to never feel rushed. For me, by far the best part of The Force Awakens were the characters. And I don't mean Han, Luke, and Leia. While it was great to see the original three back in action, and Harrison Ford gave another brilliant performance as Han Solo, the ones that really stole the show were the new characters. The story centers around Rey, an independent, resourceful scavenger on the planet Jakku. Rey has clearly endured many hardships throughout her life and yet somehow, she remains hopeful about her future and maintains a strong optimistic attitude. As the movie progresses, we see Rey begin to discover her powers with the force and how to use them. But only towards the end of the film do we realize how powerful she truly is, and I am very excited to see what's in store for her in episodes 8 and 9. Part of what made Rey such a believable, effective character was the spectacular acting performance by Daisy Ridley. No other actor could have done a better job. The majority of the comic relief in this film comes from Finn, an ex storm trooper who encounters Rey in the desert after he crashes while trying to escape the First Order. It was fascinating to see a little inside the life of a storm trooper, something we never really saw in any of the previous films. Finn is equally as believable a character as Rey, and John Boyega's performance was spot on as well. Part of what made these two characters so great was the on screen chemistry between them, something that the prequels failed to deliver with Anakin and Padme.As for Kylo Ren, aka Ben Solo, it was awesome to see such a complex character that has so many layers as the villain. We learn more about Kylo Ren's back story and personality in this one film than we do about Darth Vader in almost all of the original trilogy. The light saber temper tantrums, the side punching, the conversations with Darth Vader's helmet, Kylo Ren is the perfect balance of emotional kid and pure bad-ass. Star Wars The Force Awakens has brought back everything that I loved about the original Star Wars while at the same time, adding an element of mystery that did not exist in the originals. The movie is pure fun to watch and is so entertaining that I didn't notice any of the issues until my second viewing. If a massive grin didn't spread across your face when Han and Chewy burst through the doors of the millennium falcon, or if you didn't get goosebumps when Finn ignited Anakin's light saber for the first time, then you were never a TRUE Star Wars fan to begin with.Facts and even more facts. You're welcome ; )",Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,2488496

41,tandrei2001,disappointing,6/10,6 January 2016,"Although an enjoyable movie, there were certain parts that didn't live up to my expectations. The movie is inconsistent with previous ones in terms of how hard is to train as a Jedi, and how hard is to master the light saber . It used to take years..., remember when Luke trained with Yoda, while now people just pick the light saber and are able to fight already? These characters all looked like a bunch of amateurs as compared to the ""old"" masters. Then it's the light saber duels... which are quite boring, mostly look like some medieval heavy fights, in which you move slow because your weapons weights 30 Kilos! I also expected for the bad guy to be more of a man honoring his grandfather, but somehow, Kylo Ren looks like he just landed here from the Twilight series and gets humiliated in the final scene. By the way, no force push, no lightning? Where are the dark force features? Remember how elegant was Dooku when he dismissed both Anakin and Obi Wan in a memorable fight?

Like fan fiction with a big budget. Like a Christmas Special Star Wars reunion on the set of Spaceballs and with villains from Harry Potter or Dr Who. I just don't know what to say. I won't even review the plot (which is a total rip-off of the 1977 Star wars), the acting or the direction. This is a joke. Unwatchable garbage. You know which character I liked? That little robot that follows them around. That's it. The rest are useless.And no, I do not appreciate even more of that 'girl power' nonsense that is still being shoved down our throats. I give these 'Star Wars' zero stars.",Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,2488496
43,taylorbrown-93656,Star Wars fans everywhere thanking god for FINALLY delivering a quality Star Wars movie!,10/10,10 September 2017,"JJ Abrams did a spectacular job of bringing back Star Wars. I still need watch it again so I can analyze the entire thing and not be completely engrossed (going to be hard to do) in the movie throughout the time I was watching it. The Force Awakens is a masterpiece, period. Rey is the first female lead character in any movie that I truly love with no faults. Daisy Ridley hit it out of the park. Harrison Ford also did a solid job. It was hard not to like Poe or Finn because of their intrinsic qualities. Kylo Ren was an astounding villain with so much rage, uncertainty, and raw power in the force. The movie was a great watch, I'd probably say it's a 9/10 to non Star Wars fans and a 10/10 for ALL Star Wars fans everywhere. They left a lot of things to look forward to in the next film and I simply cannot wait for December 2017 to roll around!!!",Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,2488496

(wrong and laughably again), or even more hilariously ""it was nothing like George Lucas' Star Wars films!"". But fortunately most people by now know that when there is a change of director within a franchise you can always expect the movies to have a lot of contrary, clueless whiny trolls crying about them. Though most tend to die off and go on with their lives the first few weeks after the movie releases.......at least all the ones that actually HAVE lives do ; )You have to give JJ credit, he did a helluva great job and even managed to SURPASS the original trilogy. How many other sequel directors can say that.....exactly.There is more humor compared to the other Star Wars, which I believe played a big part in the success of this new installment. To cap off, this new episode is worth the wait. A new beginning, a new set of characters, but it's still the Star Wars I fell in love with. I have and will watch it again and again, it's THAT good : )",Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,2488496

The movie was well directed and a genuine Star Wars feel was evident throughout.Throughout the whole 2 and a half hour running time, I was treated to a masterpiece of visual effects as well as well as a compelling and convincing story which introduced the two new lead characters: Rey and Finn. I thought BB-8 was a humorous, cute character and can't wait to see more of him in the upcoming films. JJ Abrams did an amazing job creating easily the best film of the year.Out of all the Star Wars films, this is definitely the second best in the franchise (just BARELY behind The Empire Strikes Back)",Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,2488496
46,waddleslover,Great,9/10,15 September 2017,"This movie is the perfect way to introduce Star Wars to a generation that was almost plagued with nothing but those god awful prequels.The characters are likable, the story is similar but with a fresh new take, and it pays homage to the original trilogy by mixing in ideas from the first three movies and combining them into this visual masterpiece. Personally, there is only one problem I have with this movie, the rathar chase. But even that I didn't have too much of a problem with.Overall Star Wars: The Force Awakens is one of the best if not the best movie released in 2015, here's hoping The Last Jedi continues this trend

47,sdebeaubien,Geriatric Attempt At Reboot,6/10,12 January 2016,"You know, what bothered me the most when I saw this movie was I just kept feeling that ""Deja vu"" like I'd seen all this before. I had! In 1977 with Episode IV! It's simply a reboot, told with a few new characters, and a few ... geriatric ones, who probably shouldn't have been in it at all, except perhaps in cameo roles or some such.I was very disappointed in JJ Abrams efforts, given that he did such a wonderful job on the Star Trek reboot. Anyhow, the plot is nearly identical to Ep. IV, and the plot holes are even larger! The bad guy was so poor quality as to be cartoonish. In fact, I walked out initially giving the movie a 7/10 for being a decent Comic Book adaptation, but that's all. I went back later and downgraded it for being so doggoned disappointing.Technically, the movie is pretty good, with good action scenes, and decent aerobatics with the various spacecraft involved whether they're flying in space or in atmosphere. But there were just too many ""Impossible"" things to reconcile for me, like how does a garbage man have intimate knowledge of a station that complex, and how does his ""Captain"" have intimate knowledge of the shield around the station, and how come if he/she is actually able to turn it off, nobody else can't simply turn it back on?Like I said, too many plot holes to be anything but a Comic Book, and not enough on the decent acting side to merit any real comment. The whole movie is spent looking for Luke, then at the end it's like we've achieved some state of nirvana in that we've actually found him! We found him! Visually stunning, that final landscape lacks depth because it's like some proverbial vision quest that ends in a speechless moment of awe and inspiration, but the movie as a whole lacks both.Sorry guys. I hate to say this movie was a HUGE disappointment, but it was (disappointing).",Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,2488496

They were even worse than I remembered them. Atrocious. Unwatchable. The best thing that could ever happen was Disney getting Lucasfilm off George Lucas' hands. George Lucas, thank you for not being involved AT ALL in this movie. You almost destroyed Star Wars with the ""prequels"".But JJ Abrams and Disney... they created a masterpiece. This is movie is so stunning on so many levels I can only compare it to when I was 3 years old and watched Star Wars in a huge movie theater. Goosebumps, chills, the whole deal. This movie feels real, looks real, just like the original trilogy did. This is amazing - I couldn't imagine Disney topping the original trilogy - but in my humble opinion, they did.Disney, JJ Abrams, everyone involved - feel proud about yourselves. You made me forget the prequels ever existed, and made me feel like a 3 year old kid for two hours. Hope the same writers are involved with Episode 8 and find a way to mention that the prequels were ""some sort of mythology that never happened"", then i'll be a happy, true Star Wars fan!t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-TEN!",Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,2488496

50,tlacoman,Memories Of The Past Attached To A Wonderful Film,10/10,22 July 2017,"The Force Awakens is the illustration of an emotional moment for me. Whenever I watch it I feel ... something. An emotion that is very personal, dark, sad, yet very happy. This film was the turning point from being the optimistic, emotional mute, happy yet dumb kid to the anxious, critical, emotional yet still optimistic teen. So much of my personal thoughts and feeling where forced onto this movie. So much memories of drawing Rey, Finn, and Kylo Ren from the trailers with my friends. So much memories of countless lunches just debating what the plot will be about and who the narrator was from the trailers is. It took over my life. Now at this moment in my life I was told to be more of a man. I had a strict rule with myself that no crying, no bad thoughts, no emotional things would be allowed in this body of mine. During my first midnight premiere, dressed up and pumped up. I cried for the first time I can ever remember. It all got released and it changed me. It's one of the most important moments in my 15 years of being alive. I also gained an interest in film that has never left me to this day. Oh and the film was amazing by the way.",Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,2488496

Only thing i liked was Han Solo-Kylo's relationship that sets tone Star Wars always had-family drama.Other Characters were disappointing,even Rey who should have been girl-Luke,but instead of complex character we have got Mary-Sue baddass. Master Jedi in disguise who without training defeats trained Sith and Luke's former apprentice,uses mind trick that only Jedi masters can use.Another Death Star plot was huge slap to my face.I literally Facepalmed myself during that moment.This movie made me realise how great prequels are even though execution of this film is better than prequels. Experimental and innovative work of George Lucas that condenses major philosophies,religions,spirituality,psychology into one Epic Saga started with episode I(yes!!) and ended with Episode VI.If Episode VIII will be same parody of Original trilogies,we may say that Star Wars is officially ruined.",Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,2488496
52,jaredpahl,Disney Sponsored Fan Fiction. The Force Awakens Is A Disgraceful Example Of Corporate Filmmaking.,1/10,7 April 2016,"For those praising this film, Star Wars Episode 7 is a despicable corporate product of a movie, that leeches off the imagination of the man who created its universe, while simultaneously giving him a giant middle finger by erasing all remnants of his Prequel Trilogy and turning the franchise into a vehicle for pandering fan service and a ""progressive"", feminist agenda. Episode 7 is nothing but glorified fan fiction made by a corporation desperate to get a return on their investment. With years of careful risk-benefit analysis, they were able to produce a film that upset the least amount of the rabid, vicious ""original fan base"" as possible.So ""fans"", you got everything you wanted. George Lucas, and the prequels are but a memory and you get all your original toys back, with just enough new crap to fool you into thinking your experiencing something fresh. You'll see the next 20 Star Wars movies and you'll get everything you begged to have, but you'll never be surprised. When Lucas wrote the script for A New Hope, he wasn't trying to please anyone but himself. He wasn't feeding a hungry mob everything they wanted, he was crafting a story that he wanted to see told on film. After 6 great chapters, he finished his story. So enjoy Disney's Star Wars movies until the end of time, but just remember that you're never going to see a film series so daring, ambitious, and above all, entertaining as George Lucas' Star Wars. Now, onto the aspects of this travesty that I fundamentally stand against.1. A Star Wars Movie Without George Lucas Is Not Star WarsGeorge Lucas didn't just have a part in the making of Star Wars, he CREATED it. Star Wars wasn't a collaboration that incorporated the imaginations of many different people. It wasn't an adaptation of someone else's work. Star Wars is solely the product of one man's imagination. Sure, tons of people worked on the films, but the entire Star Wars universe is George Lucas' vision. The uniqueness of Star Wars is that it all comes from the mind of one, incredibly creative man. Episodes 1-6 are the official Star Wars story as told by the man who created it. Any other story is, by definition, an imitation. Lucasfilm can try all they like to make these new movies look and feel like the real deal, but the truth of the matter is, they will never be the genuine article. Lucas' quirky touch is what makes Star Wars special. Without it, it's just another disposable sci-fi franchise.2. Every Decision Was Made By A Corporation. The Force Awakens is a focus-grouped, market researched, PRODUCT that reeks of corporate control. After acquiring Lucasfilm, Disney had this film made so they would make their money back and then some. Storytelling was absolutely secondary. And the conception of the film isn't the only glaringly obvious corporate decision in Episode 7. EVERY major decision in the film was overseen by Disney and Lucasfilm. The new characters in particular reek of corporate greed and agenda pushing. The main character is a female and the secondary characters are mostly played by women or minorities. Disney will champion these casting decisions as a progressive triumph, but the truth of the matter is that these new characters exist purely as a PR move. Congratulations, your SJW street cred is through the roof, but I will never support a movie that uses someone else's creation as a platform to help their brand. 3. It Panders To A Vocal Minority Of ""Fans""It absolutely sickens me that this movie deliberately ignores and actively mocks the prequels. George Lucas spent 10 years of his life crafting those films, and millions of people loved them, but the executives at Lucasfilm and Disney were so afraid of the pathetic internet trolls that they became one themselves. All the marketing of ""The movie you've been waiting for since 1983!"", ""It's all real!"", ""The magic is back!""... it's all a ploy to appease a vocal minority of sad losers that couldn't stand that Episodes 1,2, and 3 tried new things. Even the title of the movie is a shot at the prequels. ""The Force Awakens"", as if those 3 massively popular movies somehow put the force to sleep. Once again, all of these decisions are corporate based. As a result, we get a two hour apology tour. They hear people complain about dialogue, so everyone becomes an over-acting spunk machine. They hear people complain about politics, so they ax that aspect entirely. Basically, they hear people complain about the prequels, so they do everything possible to remove them from memory. ""We hate George Lucas and the prequels too, see?"" Because the vocal minority of whiners is more important than the majority of people who love Lucas' entire saga. It's almost shocking how disrespectful Lucasfilm has been to prequel fans and Lucas himself. Almost. 4. This Is A Troubling Sign Of Things To Come. The Force Awakens ushers in an era of prostitution for the Star Wars name. With Episode 7, Disney has learned that they can make whatever they want, and as long they do exactly what the ""fans"" tell them, they'll have a cash cow that never dries up, and they'll never have anyone complain. After all, fans are getting everything they want, right? Well what about those of us that want to see NEW things? These corporations don't care about us. New ideas could upset people, so innovation loses over imitation. The Star Wars story ended in 2005. It's time for something new. Boycott the rest of Disney's Star Wars fan-fiction, and maybe we can prevent Star Wars Episode 7: The Force Awakens from being the movie that killed the blockbuster.",Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,2488496
53,tapio_hietamaki,An energetic space adventure,9/10,2 February 2017,"When I came out of the theater after watching 'The Force Awakens' I never thought that I would have to defend it against haters. It seemed that the movie had taken its audience by storm: it was lauded as a triumphant return to form for the Star Wars franchise after lackluster prequel films. Now, a year later, people seem to have turned against it. It copied Episode IV, they say, it is manipulative and calculated, it is derivative to the point of repeating key plot points and characters.It is true that there is a lot of nostalgia pandering in the movie, a flaw that also plagued 'Jurassic World' which came out the same year, but that pandering hardly ruined my enjoyment of either movie. 'The Force Awakens' is energetic and adventurous. It does things by the book, but it does them right. There are the lovable underdog heroes, there is the menacing villain and the sinister mentor behind him, there are the allegories of fascism and there is the sense of wonder that hints at such a large world that we are glimpsing at. There is urgency and there are high stakes, there is trust and betrayal, old heroes and new. There are lightsabers and massive superweapons, space magic and robot comic reliefs.Another complaint that people have seems to be that Rey is too good at everything. I don't mind that at all and I think it is wonderful to see how her character will grow. She seems to be in a similar position as Anakin at the beginning of Episode II: a gifted prodigy who requires careful guidance, but will she listen to her tutors? And will she have a romantic subplot? But the thing that steals the movie for me is the villain. And I don't mean Snoke. Kylo Ren is something both new and familiar: he's an insecure Darth Vader, a menacing villain whose heart might not be in it. He is troubled, and his soul is twisted. He is not a cold killing machine, on the contrary, he is constantly in pain. He is reminiscent of a younger Darth Vader, the tortured Anakin Skywalker, who he so greatly admires. Now there are those who don't like him because he's an angsty teenager, the type who yells at his parents, smokes in defiance and listens to Linkin Park. And he is. But unlike Anakin, who was wooden and unlikeable, he is believable and relatable in his angst. He is a tragic hero, for sure, but the movie doesn't glorify his tragedy but makes us see the irony of it. He is as funny as he is brooding. A great combination for any fan of 'Angel', the TV show about a vampire with a soul.",Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,2488496

There are three very critical reasons why it is better than the original:1) Better effects - Obviously the effects are going to surpass the original because of the time difference.2) Better plot - In the original, the plot was......fine, but this one brings a whole new level of greatness 3) The New Jedi - Not going to say who it is, but I love this person a lot!All in all, I would definitely recommend watching this amazing movie!!!",Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,2488496

And return of Han Solo unfortunately he died Which was a shock when I watched it at the Cinema but overall great film With a great plot with the 1st Order and the Resistance I really liked Adam Driver as Kylo Ren. With his awesome mask and he was a different kind of character that you don't tend to see in Star wars at the end I thought the bit with Luke Skywalker and was a let down as I hoped to see more of Luke but it was a very good film to watch.,Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,2488496

They're movies, they're entertaining, get over it. The Force Awakens has everything you want in a Star Wars movie. The acting was good, as was the action and special effects. If you're a fan you owe it to yourself to go see it. If you're a hater you probably still will and then spend the rest of your time on the net complaining how George Lucas raped your childhood and JJ is a hack. Don't listen to the pathetic haters, go see it for yourself. You won't be disappointed!10/10

57,mjsmjs-46362,Star Wars is headed in the right direction again,7/10,17 June 2017,"Disney taking the Star Wars reigns out of George Lucas's hands is likely the single best thing that could have happened to the franchise after the controversial prequel mess. With the prequels, Lucas managed to take Star Wars about as far away from what make it work in the first place as was possible, destroying many of the great things about the original trilogy in the process. Effectively, Star Wars was dead...Lucas wouldn't have been able to pull off any future films, even if he would have been inclined to do so.Personally, I was excited when I heard Disney had purchased Lucasfilm and announced plans to make new Star Wars movies. Love em or hate em, if there is one thing Disney knows how to do, it's make successful films. I was even more excited when I heard that Lucas himself had been cut out of the creative loop, the last thing we needed was for him to take us further down the horrible path he chose to take Star Wars with the prequels. After Lucas was dismissed from involvement with the new Star Wars films, I imagine Disney sat down and took a long hard look at what made the original trilogy such a beloved success and the prequels such a criticized mess. Undoubtedly, they didn't want their new franchise to be met with the same overall negativity the prequels received.The formula they came up with was overly simplistic...Star Wars 1977 worked, so let's mirror it. Episode 7 is essentially a reboot of the original movie at its heart. The story is remarkably similar, and each major character from the original is mirrored by a new character. Even the original characters, in addition to being who they were, also seem to at times mirror other original character roles from Star Wars 1977.As simplistic as this is, the bottom line is it worked. Episode 8 looks and ""feels"" like a Star Wars movie, and it's the first one that's been able to pull that off since 1983. The movie has its flaws to be sure, but when put against the prequels, it's superior in almost every aspect. More importantly, it brought back some of the magic to Star Wars that the prequels had effectively snuffed out. No mention of space bugs in your cells that make you strong with the force, no ridiculous prophecy, no distracting fluff and scene bloat, no circus side show of unnecessary characters, dialog and scenes, no uncomfortable and awkward botched romance side story....and no Jar Jar Binks or his equivalent.Instead you have a well paced and clear story. Interesting characters you can connect with on an emotional level. Special effects that dazzle you but don't overwhelm you or take center stage. You have what made Star Wars...well, Star Wars.Taking my young son on it to opening night left me with this thought in my head....that movie experience was, for him, as close as he was going to get to the same experience I had as a child going to see Star Wars in the theater for the first time. And that, in and of itself, made this movie a success in my eyes",Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,2488496

I'm seriously baffled by some of these reviews. I'm sure if this series is ever rebooted, or another entry releases in 20+ years, you'll all yearn for JJ's Star Wars. You people have no idea what you want and will just complain no matter what is put forth. Cut the crap.I thought this movie was great. The new characters, Finn and Rey, were instantly likable, and the inclusion of old favorites felt natural. I highly recommend this film and I think most NORMAL people will enjoy it.

59,TouchTheGarlicProduction,A (near) perfect synthesis of old and new. This FEELS like Star Wars!,6/10,15 December 2015,"This movie hits every conceivable emotion, but above all, it's fun. Nowadays, we have so much dark gritty stuff which is great and deep, but it gets tiring. And, things that try to be fun come off as overly silly and dumbed down. The Force Awakens does something not many films have done successfully in a while; combine the two seamlessly into one balanced package. The prequels tried to do this, and it blew up in Lucas' face. The reason it works in this movie is that all the humour and drama comes naturally from the characters. Yes, the plot and beats are VERY similar to A New Hope, but that was a great movie. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Besides, that's exactly what's been missing from movies lately. So don't listen to all these negative reviewers saying ""it's a remake"", or a ""rip-off"". Towards the end, it goes completely its own way becoming more like The Empire Strikes Back.Let's start with the characters. It's great to see the old characters back in action. The Han and Leia scenes could have easily felt like they were just in there for nostalgia factor, but they feel natural and factor into the plot. Given the vast number of characters, it's amazing how very few of them feel shoe-horned in. There are three that I can think of who did, but all three of them are confirmed to be in the next one, so I'll get my fix then. However, the real standouts are the new characters. Adam Driver brings unexpected depth to Kylo Ren. Oscar Isaac is intensely likable as Poe Dameron. John Boyega is great as Finn. But the best is Daisy Ridley as Rey. She is going to be in so much more stuff, I guarantee. The chemistry between her and Finn was one of my favourite parts of the movie.The cinematography is incredible. The camera never moved around in the originals. Here, it follows around the action, capturing the feeling of playing with toys as a kid more perfectly than any movie before. It also just feels so much like Star Wars. Every sound and image is familiar. The movie has a real presence; the practical effects make it feel real. John Williams' new score is great, of course. He does a great job integrating the old with the new. In fact, that would be my summary of the movie. It pays enough homage to the original while setting up an exciting new story. I like how not everything is revealed by the end of this film. The final shot perfectly sums up all the questions we are left with and foreshadows what to come. It may be one of my favourite final shots of a movie ever.In conclusion, some people are going to hate on it for being too much like the originals, others are going to complain that it's not enough like them. Some will say too many questions were answered, others will say that not enough were. In the end, there are so many expectations riding on this film that it will never live up to everyone's hype. It's a minor miracle what JJ did. He had to bring in all of the old, set up a sprawling galaxy of new, establish what's been going on for 30 years between films, add humour, add drama, and somehow make it cohesive and fun. If you go in with the understanding that this is a movie, not the second coming, you will leave immensely satisfied.",Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,2488496

The cast and characters, old and new, are all phenomenal but Daisy Ridley (Rey) stole the show for me. I have fallen in love with Star Wars all over again. Thank you JJ Abrams for a story that will live on for generations to come. Wow! Bring on Episode VIII! The greatest Star Wars movie of all time and the most fun I've ever had in the theater. I just bought it on blu-ray and will enjoy this film for the remainder of my life. Just amazing.

61,joeravioli,An exercise in nostalgia and CGI,6/10,20 December 2015,"After watching this film (and being relatively unimpressed by it), I went to Superstore to pick up a few groceries. Unexpectedly, the film's value hit me there, rather than when I was in the theater watching the film, as it was in the store that I became aware of modern film's propensity to market rather than to innovate. Pictures of Stormtroopers, Rey, Finn, and Kylo Ren crowded the shelves, plastered onto Shreddies' boxes, Jam jars, Eggs, TV screens, clothing, toothpaste, organic chips, and even diapers. I realized that a two and a quarter hour exercise in bland escapism had managed to transcend the silver screen, embedding itself firmly in our everyday lives, from our diapers to our cereal. While I do find this rather abhorrent, I can't deny that it is definitely remarkable.Art and novelty have been pushed to the side in favour of economic triumph. The Force Awakens, buoyed onwards by skillful marketing and rabid nostalgia, will end up as one of the highest-grossing films of all time. Collectibles, diapers, cereal, etc. branded with characters and logos will bring in even more billions of dollars. And, as we glance at the lineup of big-budget blockbusters coming to theatres (Batman vs Superman, TMNT 2, Allegiant (split into two parts), remakes, reboots, and a slew of Marvel and DC extravaganzas) it seems as if Hollywood has figured out that this is the way to go. It has finally donned the costume of a clown that knows only one trick, but can do it better (and bigger) each time.I'm not down on Hollywood. I'm down on (most) modern action films for their money-grubbing emptiness, and the new addition to the Star Wars franchise exemplifies my sentiment.Star Wars: The Force Awakens is highly reminiscent of the original trilogy, borrowing plot points, scenes, and characters directly from the most memorable and enjoyable bits in Lucas's classic galactic romp. Although this is at first quite fun, one eventually realizes that this film brings nothing new to the table, except for a plethora of CGI and a surprising new character. The film's fear to be its own film is its undoing. It panders to expectations, forcing the audience to be unable to watch the film without comparing it to what came before.My excitement at being returned to the Star Wars universe ended after the opening crawl.The Force Awakens begins in about the same way as A New Hope. A base of some sort is attacked, a droid (who communicates in beeps) is given a valuable piece of information by some guy, who is taken prisoner by the First Order (led by a creepy guy in a mask with a low voice named Kylo Ren). Damn, what movie did I just describe? The plot eventually takes a better hold, with a Stormtrooper named going rogue, teaming up with some girl named Rey (who has found the droid), and them leaving the planet, chased by Stormtroopers, in...the Millennium Falcon. And or course, since they brought the Millennium Falcon back, they have to bring Han Solo back, so they do, and he's, well, old. Chewbacca hasn't aged a day, though.And while all this is happening, the new Death Star (Basically the original Death Star except a planet) blows up a bunch of planets, while Kylo Ren feels the ""pull of the light"". I wanted to punch the screenwriter in the face at this point. One does not simply have the bad guy kill billions of people, and then have the audience sympathize with him. Sure, Darth Vader did the same thing, but in A New Hope, he was the essence of evil. Ren is weak, boring, and takes off his mask way too early in the film.Oh, and the Emperor is there too. But he's got a different name. Coke or Snoke, or something like that.The screenplay is rather poor. The characters and their interactions are forced and implausible. No secrets are kept from the audience. Many of the pivotal plot elements occur by chance. I felt as if the screenwriter lacked sensitivity to the things that he wrote as the film did not deliver story and innovation. Instead, it served to recreate the plot all of us Star Wars fans know, and amp it up with visuals, while not realizing that simply by copying the success of the original trilogy (and not even copying it well), it is a useless cinematic experience.Although I did not like the film, I would still like to applaud the visual effects team. Some shots and sequences were simply divine. The recreation of the bridge scene from Empire Strikes Back is gorgeous (albeit ridiculously scripted), and the final battle scene is rousing enough to be commendable. If the screenwriter and crew were passionate about making something original and sensible rather than appealing to nostalgia, I think that The Force Awakens would have actually been worthy of its critical acclaim. But as it stands, The Force Awakens is insipid, lethargic nostalgia that attempts to reignite the franchise's former prestige without feeling a need to create its own.",Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,2488496
62,Searsino,Star Wars: The Force is for Everyone Apparently,2/10,19 February 2016,"Context: I grew up on these films. I didn't think the first trilogy was the ""best thing ever made,"" but the story was gripping, the material was fresh, and I couldn't get enough of it. Hell, I can still remember playing the pod racer game on N64 after episode 1 came out and every time I would race, would relive the stories in my mind.It has become abundantly clear after sitting through this cash-cow that one can ascertain from fairly obvious decision-making for this film the following notions:1) There was NO intention of contributing to an amazing story. Instead the saga ripped-off general focal points from the previous films... Just to name a few: a larger Death Star, the same weapon/laser-beam on this larger Death Star, the only weakness of said giant Death Star, the only villain wearing a Vader-like mask.2) Success of the film largely will be based on (A) appealing to small children who cannot look away from bright shiny light and CGI effects, (B) loyal fans of the first trilogy who managed to hang in there for the 2nd trilogy (somewhat of a train-wreck) through introducing original cast-mates strategically over a 2-hour period forcing us to sit tight to the end.They made things even more apparent by recreated Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina on Tatooine. Throughout the entire film, I simply could not stop thinking that I was being tricked into paying just because they took advantage of my appreciation for the earlier movies.3) I briefly mentioned this, but it bears repeating: THE STORY WAS AWFUL!!! Little more could have been done to show how J.J. Abrams felt about this one... Sure, I'll credit him with a great rendition of Star Trek, but in Ep-7 I found it extremely difficult not to feel like during the development phase, he would often write a bit and then get bored with it whereby taking a huge bowel movement on that particular piece and proceeding on to the next scene.For example, when Han Solo finally reunited with Leia (aka Princess Leia) after 30 years... boy oh boy was that one of the most poorly designed representations of long-lost love between two people: upon seeing one another they put on a sad face whereby Chewbacca walks by and pats her on the back in such a casual way as if to say ""Whats up Laya.""This one gets two stars!I cannot help but feel some attachment to seeing Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher in their original roles just one last time.Ultimately, what made this entire experience a failure, was how the following two items were depicted: (1)The Force, (2)the Lightsabre.(1)THE FORCE: The fabric which lines this fantastically designed mythical world which has so much history. The Force was offered up as little more than a ""trick"" which may be learned with little training or dedication to having a greater understanding. Remember how long Luke spent trying to uncover all the different ways which the force encapsulates his world? He would duel blindfolded with a drone, gain incites into future events, connect with his sister through feeling the force, fetching the lightsaber out of snow while tied up in a cave about to be eaten by a yeti... you get the idea. Yet Rey spends about 2 minutes repeating a few words to a guard, thereby forcing him to release her, having completely harnessed something Luke doesn't manage for a greater portion of his time as a Jedi, well past the point where his training is announced as complete by Yoda. It felt as if the writers simply were instructed to skip addressing this aspect of Rey because it would take away from all the cheap, effortless ways by which to garner more paying viewers. (2)LIGHTSABER: How many different people were going to casually whip out Luke's lightsaber during tight situations? It was ridiculous how often this would occur...But I digress... I shan't keep you away any longer... If you're a small child or never cared for any of the originals, then this film is for you. But for everyone else out there who grew up on the first trilogy, it has been despicable to see how these people have taken advantage of such an amazing story in exchange for ticket sales... Having said all that, I am beginning to question the ratings. At one point this site was the most reliable source for film reviews (Rotten Tomatoes always seemed to be the biased place), however after seeing the overall rating and many of the initial reviews (of which I AM CERTAIN the consensus for this film is not in the 80% range), this site is losing the usefulness it once had.And a ""Top 250"", no less? Yea right... The review system is losing its validity. Now I notice a pattern immediately after release whereby numerous fake accounts are created which then give raving 10-star reviews. It's so clear what is happening there, but IMDb seems not to have a solution nor want to fix the problem.----- 2/10 STARS -------- Review by Searsino -----",Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,2488496
63,brandonrhewitt,People that are hating this film are sheeps,10/10,13 June 2019,"This is actually better than the originals i love all star wars films but im watching back the originals and honestly they are so boring the prequels and the new sequel trilogy so far are way better honestly this film is better than a new hope and honestly its not even that much of a remake its kinda different there are some bits the same but this is way better than all 3 of the originals. So people who are saying this is rubbish ur just being ungrateful coping what those few other people are saying and making up little stories bout other people hating it because your all low lifes this is one of the best star wars films only behind ROTS and LJ. Plus most people who watched this film obviously love it because it made like over 2 billion in the box office and raked even more money when dvd was released

64,ryiannis,The Force Awakens but with a hangover. It's acting weird!,8/10,7 January 2016,"Well, I've waited a bit to make any comments on this film, I thought I'd let my head cool off first, digest what I saw in the movie, before I go on ranting and complaining about what was presented to us. Maybe I got this wrong, maybe I was not supposed to watch a film which would be a logical follow up to the storyline of Episode 6. On the other hand, there are some other issues here, not depending on the movie but very important when it comes to how the movie will impact the viewer and it what way. I watched the Episode 4 back in 1977 when it was first released. I was just 13 years old. I still remember, I left the theater in awe! Everybody back then had no idea what was coming to them! Spaceships, robots, laser blasters, storm-troopers, warp travel etc, all presented on the big screen with such realism, for 2 hours one felt like being in a different world, one wanted to join that world! No one really commented on the acting and the plot. Those were totally irrelevant to the feelings viewers have experienced. Well, now we are in 2016. We use so much technology, not even George Lucas back then would have imagined. We have stuff that was not available even in the Empire it self back in the 70s. Our point of view has changed. Furthermore, through out the years we have watched so many great movies, with such good plots and visual effects, we are no longer easy to be satisfied and exactly here is the problem of Episode 7. The producers should have given more attention to other details rather than realistic visual effects and fast pace action. Seen that, done that in the past. The plot is very shallow. Some times it does not make sense. - SPOILERS FOLLOW - What was the need to have Solo being killed by his son? Why did Princes Leia even exist on this episode? I mean, she is doing nothing at all except for trying to stand up straight! Really! Do not misunderstand me: Yes she should be in the movie, but with a much bigger role and importance. What happened with the Republic? I assume the Republic was in all OK and functioning, so how on earth has it allowed the First Order to grow so strong? How come, the republic forces are the so called ..resistance? The Death Planet: Ridiculous! Bad idea in every aspect. OK... let's say I'm wrong and indeed the first order could have such project build in secrecy, let's leave that and just ask this: Can the rays sent to destroy planets travel in hyperspace? Since the planet it self does not travel in space, like the death stars, I have to assume that the rays somehow can travel way faster than light, otherwise it would take for ever to reach their targets, don't you think? The bad guys: Who? Oh, them, Kylo Ren and his boss the Supreme Leader. Ren is nothing else than a bipolar punk with daddy issues! His training sucks! Come on... he got beaten by a girl who's only training was what ever she's picked up in the dessert fighting thugs! My favorite, the Supreme Leader -THIS IS ...GOLUM ON STEROIDS! I'm sure, there is no other explanation! Precious! Last point, the girl. Luke's daughter, Rey. She is the force it self, there is no other explanation. She picked up the light-saber and that was it! Boom...there you go ..A JEDI! What took Luke many years to master, she did in a few seconds! WOW! Take that Yoda!Well, I could go on and on but you must already be bored by now, so I finish my review in an optimistic mood. Episode 7 has set the stage for some great news stories in the follow. I hope the next episodes will be made with more attention to the detail and more respect to the fans of the franchise. In one sentence my over all review is this: Disney made a movie where the script was written by Donald Duck, it was directed by Mickey Mouse and the villain was Goofy!",Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,2488496

And it was a mixed audience too, not just Star Wars nerds like myself.I would describe this movie as a Star Wars that's real and gritty - I felt immersed in every scene, and not once was the spell broken, unlike the tragic prequels.The acting was superb, cinematography was amazing, and I could never tell when CGI was being used! Story was excellent with some unexpected twists, music great as always, action sequences were breathtaking. Everyone in the cinema was quite emotional by the end. I don't know how some people are giving this a low rating, they must be paid trolls getting that big payola payday from someone.

The inarguable facts (AKA the record-breaking box office) speaks for itself ; )",10/10,8 October 2017,"Before watching The Force Awakens, I was slightly skeptical. However, I can safely say I am now a HUGE fan of the Star Wars universe!The Force Awakens stands as a rock-solid foundation of a promising trilogy, which will easily surpass the original trilogy if this incredibly high standard of film making is carried forward.Clearly J.J. Abrams enjoyed every minute of work when directing this movie, and he expresses his love for the Star Wars franchise extremely well by respecting the original material and cleverly linking the trilogies and simultaneously building new, strong characters who rival even the classics such as Han or Luke. Overall, I would say that TFA is a must-see movie, not only for fans of the Star Wars franchise, but for anyone who has access to a television screen. J.J Abrams does an absolutely masterful job at showing his love and passion for Star Wars, and the finished products (Yay Episode 9!!!!) will all go down in history as some of the greatest films of any trilogy in history.",Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,2488496

The purpose of this film is to sell toys and to sever all connections with the previous six movies and make it Disney Wars.If you've seen the original, then you've already seen every scene in this one. What was JJ thinking. A forced along plot full of illogical actions. Disney and JJ ripped the fans off big time by just remaking the first one, only with an extra touch of stupidity.JJ took a red lightsaber and shoved up the fans @$! The force was not strong with this one. you can expect the next to films to eliminate all the Lucas Characters - chewy, R2, C3, Luke, Lea, and even admiral Ackbar.

Having seen all the movies at least one time each, The Force Awakens was exactly what I wanted it to be. A nod at the aging characters of the original trilogy and the setup for the next two movies. I typically do not write reviews, I just have to say I get such a kick out of the people that give this movie a low rating and share their vitriol filled breakdown of the film. I suppose it is why I only tune in for the first two weeks of American Idol, it's funny to watch a bunch of people lacking talent shaking their fists at why their vision of truth is not accepted by the masses.The damage you funny reviewers have done must be very disappointing to JJ Abrams and Co.

JJ Abhrams has done to Star Wars what he did to Stat Trek,make it a commercial success and nothing else. Star Wars is supposed to be more than commercial success...it's supposed to be more than special effects....it's supposed to be more than cheesy one liners which to be honest is not even funny.....it's supposed to be something that stays with you for a long long time,that's what episode 4 did to all its viewers. 15 minutes into the movie and we are introduced to the two new additions to the Star Wars universe who are going to take this franchise forward.But I'm sad to say for the 2 hours that followed you don't feel for either one of them.Imagine saying that to Han,Liea and Luke in episode 4!!! There is nothing wrong with the casting,it's the story that lets them done.They are just thrown at your face. The movie also suffers from major plot holes.

71,stefan-billieri,Star Wars could have been better,6/10,17 January 2016,"After watching the 7th film of Star Wars, I came to the conclusion that George Lucas would have done better. It was good but it could have been better. Even I could have done better.Seduced by the Dark Side of the Force, George sold Star Wars to Disney in 30/10/2012. Since then the fear was that the next films would not meet the expectations.In 2015 the fears of the fans were confirmed by the release of the 7th episode: The Force Awakens, which impresses by the special effects but disappoints by the mediocre plot.In the view of Disney, becoming a Jedi Knight should be easier, without much training. The images that can be found on the Internet give us an idea of what we can expect from Disney. Maybe I'll see Mickey Mouse becoming a Jedi Knight too so as to help Luke Skywalker in the fight against the Dark Side.We can only hope that George come back to the Light Side and take Star Wars away from the hands of Disney. May the Force be with George!",Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,2488496
72,mcgrew,JJ does it again (and not in the good way),2/10,14 January 2016,"You'll notice that SW7 only has a ""based on characters"" credit for George Lucas. That's because Disney decided to make it ""for the fans"" -- that is, a movie pieced together out of a sort of ""greatest hits"" of the other 6 movies, with nothing new whatsoever. We are, they suppose, not smart enough to absorb new plot devices, and will be perfectly happy to give them money to show us the old stuff over again. And based on box-office revenues they appear to be right.So we get a search for 'the last jedi' (like when we were looking for Obi-Wan all those years ago) to return to the fight against tyranny, but along the way, an orphan on a desert world (like Luke Skywalker) will come into possession of a robot with information crucial to the rebellion (like R2D2), leading to an attack on a powerful planet-killer (like the Death Star), to be supported by an attack on a nearby world (like the moon of Endor, mercifully without ewoks). Then an all-in-black villain (like Darth) will be faced down by a new jedi (like Luke - - except this one can defeat a jedi master after beginning the fight not even able to activate her lightsaber), and a father and son will face off on a long bridge and one of them will fall off it (like, well, you know.) Harrison Ford appears, and doesn't even seem to even be enjoying himself -- just saying what's on the page and trying to put the whole experience behind him. (And given the awful stuff on the page, its understandable.)Meanwhile, storm troopers are appearing and disappearing as necessary, still can't shoot, their armor still doesn't to a bit of good. Just like... you get the idea. Oh yeah, and there's a bar with an alien band. Gosh, that's new.So, what do we have instead of new ideas? Lots and lots of explosions. And I mean a LOT of explosions. And x-wing fighters and tie fighters swooshing by in entirely incomprehensible combat. And more explosions. And shouting, and talking about... something -- mostly, I think, to give the effects guys time to reload their explosives. Did I mention the explosions?You don't need to see this movie. You can watch ""the middle three"" again, and you'll have the exact same plot. Don't see it -- it's a waste of your time (it certainly was a waste of mine.)",Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,2488496
73,targe1314,An amazing homage to New Hope,9/10,21 December 2015,"I was blown away by this movie, despite how obvious this was J.J. Abrams' homage to his love of the original Episode IV, A New Hope:Desert Planet, check. Lone poor abandoned character who dreams of the stars. Check. - Droid with secret message. Check. - Evil Darth Vader villain. Check. - Giant Death Star planet killer. Check. - Heroes use Millennium Falcon as their ride. Check. - Only hope is a desperate attack on the giant death star with x-wings, flying down a crevice/tunnel too, while heroes battle it out on station. Check.Then we get his echoes of other movies. Ice Planet. Check. Confrontation on precarious bridge over a giant chasm, between father and son. Check.So, with all my negative points above, you'd think I'd HATE this thing.But I didn't.Adam Driver needed to KEEP HIS MASK ON, for god's sake! He is WAY TOO PRETTY for an evil villain! CUT YOUR DAMN HAIR!!!!And newbie kids figure out lightsabre dueling in five minutes. I'm an experienced swordsman and I'm sorry. That's just bat terd crazy.I was also HUGELY DISAPPOINTED in how they treated Captain Fasma. Here is a brilliant actress, hugely hounorable and respected in GOT, hugely talented with weapons, and apparently so was Captain Fasma. But instead you have her whimperingly lowering her own base's shields with a vague threat, and then thrown ignomiously into a trash compactor. REALLY??? I hope she refuses to do another movie for you.But I loved Rey, despite her obvious parallels to Luke. Her acting was phenomenal, as was Finn, the stormtrooper with a heart of gold. Po Dameron was an excellent hero character and I'm glad they resurrected him.Loved lil' BB-8, more than R2-D2, and wish they had taken him along as their sidekick at the end of the movie. C-3PO just seemed old hat and was annoying.Seeing Chewie with major parts, and how babyish he is when injured, was awesome.My favorite part was Finn, with his buddy's bloody handprint on his mask, stumbling around the battlefield in horror. Never done before in Star Wars. They personalized the stormtroopers. Awesome.Some of the x-wing battle flight scenes were crazy good. Wanted more.The 3D was pointless, until the Star Destroyer was hovering in the theatre over me, then I was blown away and tried to touch it's nose.Killing Han was HORRIFIC!!!! But necessary, and likely the only reason he agreed to do the movie. WHY OH WHY couldn't they have killed Leia too? Good God. What is wrong with her mouth?Really, really wish they had chopped Adam Driver up into little eenie weeenie bits. He just doesn't work with the mask off. He is NO Darth Vader, but he was at least half that with his mask on. With it off, he just transformed into Severus Snape, was waiting for a potion to come out from under his cloak.

75,totalovrdose,Star Wars Episode Seven is a Force to be Reckoned With,9/10,16 December 2015,"The opening of Star Wars, The Force Awakens, with the titles traveling along the screen, and the orchestra following in the background, immediately absorbed me into the experience. Although I initially feared this sequel would fall flat, from the very beginning, the film sends its audience on a magnificent ride across the galaxy. There are significant gaps in the story-line, from the conclusion of the last installment up until this point in time, some of which are addressed over the film's duration, while others will hopefully be answered in future episodes. Despite some segments of the film bearing a striking resemblance to scenes encountered in previous installments, these are so well delivered, they offer the viewer moments of nostalgia, that have not been felt, since the original trilogy, all those years ago.Acting heavy-weights, like Harrison Ford in his return as Han Solo, Carrie Fisher as General Leia Organa and Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker, help revitalize the franchise, though their screen time is minimal in contrast with the new faces. Ford offers both a melancholic and nostalgic performance, that lends emotion to his scenes, as a former war hero turned smuggler, while his take charge attitude, and banter with Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), remains as entertaining as ever. Max Von Sydow additionally has a cameo role, of significant import, though again, deserved more time on screen.Rey (Daisey Ridley) is a scavenger on the desert planet of Jakku, who scroungers desperately to survive, while awaiting the return of her lost family. When she encounters a droid, BB-8, she has no idea of the adventure, not to mention the danger, she has inadvertently put herself in. Holding information vital to both the Resistance, the protagonists in the film, and the First Order, the villainous group that has taken over from the Galactic Empire, it seems almost everyone in the galaxy is seeking its retrieval. Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), a Sith with an interestingly poignant past, is one such character who pursues the droid, in the hopes of capturing the information contained within.Driver, most known for his comedic roles, is especially great, being as villainous as he is sentimental, brilliantly demonstrating a man with no control over his emotions. In contrast, fellow villains, including General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson), and Captain Phasma (Gwendoline Christie), don't appear as frequently, nor receive as much depth, which is unfortunate, considering how interesting their characters are.When Rey encounters Finn (John Boyega), a storm trooper, who despises the violent actions of the First Order, they are forced to make a series of difficult choices, that will lead them on a journey across the universe. Boyega and Ridley are equally terrific in their roles, and are great characters for the audience to follow, demonstrating acts of heroism and courage throughout the film.Furthermore, landscapes across the universe depict planets that have continued on after the war with the Galactic Empire, the remnants of fallen behemoths dotting the horizons. The vehicles and weaponry that are utilized, remind audiences of episodes four thought to six, and the moment the light sabre makes its appearance, I doubt a single person will be able to contain their excitement.The soundtrack is very much reminiscent of the franchise, and legitimizes the experience. The special effects are incredible, from battles in outer space, to fights on the ground, lasers and explosions littering the battlefield of the frequent, and fast paced, action scenes. Though Episodes Seven is basically one action scene after the next, the script provides enough emotional depth and characterization between these scenes, to keep audiences invested. Not only this, humor is well incorporated, the banter between characters, alongside the one-liners, bringing a series of laughs, beside the frenetic explosions.To view the film in 3D offers the viewer significant depth, though moments when characters, props, or the general setting, jump out at the audience, are quite minimal. When this does occur, often it is from the left, or the right of the screen, rather than from the very center, making the effect less impressive. If you were hoping to feel as though you might get hit at any moment by an incoming laser, sadly, that will not transpire here.Though a couple of moments during the plot are predictable, Star Wars Episode Seven is a brilliant return to a franchise that was originally only meant to house six episodes. If this new installment is what we ought to expect from the upcoming films, then the Star Wars universe is looking very bright indeed.",Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,2488496
76,cindylewis,Absolutely perfect in everything it sets out to do.,10/10,17 August 2017,"I love Star Wars, especially the original stuff, of course. The Force Awakens stays true to the original trilogy; with the start of the film on a Tatooine-like planet, Jakku, as per usual. It follows the thrilling journey of the brilliant Poe of the Resistance and Finn of past Storm trooper relation, at first, as you are thrown into the blistering excitement. But then there is a twist in the main hero being a girl. It works both simply for a change, but also in that it is pretty much a first in as big a film as Star Wars that the main character is a female. That wouldn't matter, though, if the character wasn't a likable hero, or if the acting wasn't any good. Fortunately, those boxes are ticked, as with every character in the film bar Snoke, who is an example of bad CGI, unfortunately. He doesn't play a very big part, though, and other than him the special effects are fantastic — with the use of more practical effects being a refreshing move from Lucasarts, and one that the film benefits from, as it doesn't look artificial like so many films do nowadays (The Hobbit, Star Wars prequels, Avengers, etc).Along with the great use of practical effects, there are fantastically designed costumes all over the joint, with great designs ranging from the new-look storm troopers to Kylo Ren and his super cool outfit.Going back to character, though, the move from Disney to advertise Finn as the main Jedi was clever, as it meant for the reveal of Rey as the Jedi to be much better than otherwise could have been possible. Finn, though, is a fantastic character, with John Boyega deserving more nominations than he's received for his charismatic performance. One other thing done well with The Force Awakens is the lack of slow story development which so marred the progress of the prequel films, and A New Hope, and also the decision to focus on characters to develop the story other than excess plot development means for better character development and means you actually like the characters, unlike Episodes I, II and III. Moreover, the return of light-heartedness and inclusion of comedy makes it an even more enjoyable watch; however, mixed with darker themes clearly inspired by the best parts of Episode III, there is more violence and concentration on action — with that providing excitement, and the comedy bringing extra enjoyment. Finn personifies the more light- hearted approach along with the brilliant BB8, and Kylo Ren is a fantastic vehicle for the darker side of the film, who I love – even though some people might think he's a bit of a snotty nosed dork. Kylo Ren is probably just as good a villain as Darth Maul in my opinion at least, but he's used much, much better, fortunately. Ah, yes. The Phantom Menace. Let's all remind ourselves of that excellent part of film history. Good for you and me, though, we can forget about that now, because we have the sequel trilogy, which could even be better than the original if they keep on getting things right like they did with this film.One more thing I'm grateful was done right was the score. A mixture of both classic tracks and new ones, it's fantastic in both providing towards all the drama and the overall feel of the film. Because, by using both old tracks and new ones it reminds you of the past (sparking your nostalgia) whilst also bringing something new, which the film does fantastically with every aspect; from the story to the cast to the sets to the action and to the (you guessed it) score. Other than being a tad ridiculous in some plot turns, and lacking quite the same grandness of scale in sets and cast that the original films did – but only just, mind you; it's pretty much perfect in what it has set out to do; providing excitement, enjoyment, drama, action and nostalgia in abundance. Enough for a boy like me to squeal.Verdict:The Force Awakens is the main product of Disney's buy out, and so I'm very happy Disney got involved if it meant this beast of a film was made. It was almost a dream of mine that there would be a sequel trilogy, and it has actually happened, so I was aptly excited. My excitement was repaid emphatically, as when I sat in the cinema fulfilling one of my most anticipated pipe dreams, I was blown away by this surprisingly light-hearted yet violent, action packed and particularly well crafted, yes, beast of a film.So I give it: 94/100.",Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,2488496
77,Daryle,Pretty Disappointing...,6/10,3 January 2016,"I am not sure why I gave this a six. It probably deserves less. Maybe some of the acting was decent and at least there was no Jar-Jar Binks; although the stereotype Eastern ""grandma"" was rather painful (however, mercifully, she did not tag along).As has been mentioned many times this is not a sequel but a *remake * or reboot of IV. One or two references might be considered an homage but the whole plot was basically lifted.Also CGI battle scenes are over the top as usual in the last several outings.I've now been fooled twice into seeing the start of a ""new"" Star Wars trilogy in the theatre. Shame on me. The last two will be in watch on a library disc or Netflix category...",Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,2488496
78,lukemarron,Best film of the Star Wars saga. By......a.........MILE.,10/10,27 August 2017,"I know biased fanboys of the painfully average, outdated original trilogy will cluelessly cry about this, but yes, The Force Awakens is the most well made film of the Star Wars saga. This film has all the goodness of the original movies, characters who are easily likable, incredible effects, John Williams' rousing musical score and a great time at the cinema, enjoyable with our families and friends. But there are things which are even better than the original movies. Interaction between the lead characters is so natural, you got to commend the writers and the director J J Abrams for their amazing work. Most blockbuster films today tend to focus on spectacle and visual effects enhanced action over tender human moments. This film balances action and human drama amazingly well. The new characters are extremely memorable, the new actors Daisy Ridley and John Boyega are wonderful in their roles, along with Oscar Isaac. BB8 is extremely adorable, dare I say even better than R2D2. Adam Driver as Kylo Ren is a worthy villain, with the best motion capture actor in the world Andy Serkis, doing what he does best, as Supreme Leader Snoke. The visual effects on display here are incredible, and unlike the prequels which were ruined by their CGish feel, this one relies on practical effects. Almost everything in this film looks real, the stormtroopers look real, because they are real mean in armor, kudos for J J Abrams for not using CGI even for closeup shots of troopers. J J Abrams is a better director than George Lucas, and that will be very clear when you see the film. This film deserves every award and acclaim it received. A film as widely anticipated and hyped as this can rarely ever be this good, and yet........it is!",Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,2488496
79,lemurzx,"unoriginal film, lame bad guy",6/10,14 January 2016,"It was like watching episode IV again. Another death star, but this time built on a planet. And even easier to destroy. What's next, a death galaxy?But the worst part was the bad guy. So lame and laughable. Without his helmet his face doesn't inspire even a bit of fear. And no Sith would ever get hurt on a sword fight by a storm trooper that doesn't even has the force with him.To make the film even more laughable, the supreme leader Snoke doesn't just look like Gollum, but it's actually performed by the same actor that does Gollum in Lord of the Rings.",Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,2488496
80,the_real_smile,Action overshadows the Star Wars universe story,8/10,20 December 2015,"Yes, the action and cgi are good. Sadly the movie drowns in it and leaves no room for the Star Wars story. As some other reviewer already pointed out, yes it is a remake of part IV. When part I came out the audience was not happy, they missed something. How is it possible that one can watch part 4 - 6 every year, part 1 - 3 every couple of years and part VII once every 10 years? Same thing with all the other movies like Star Trek: the future begins, the Tranformers trilogy, the latest Avanger movies, when does one get tired of 2 hours only action, action and more action? This movie just does not have the George Lucas touch, it is another mainstream brave Disney family action movie. Part 4 - 6 had some pretty daring scenes, Leila in exciting cloths, this movie everyone is wrapped from head to toe, so damn brave it makes you sick. I conclude to say it's another victim of Disney.

81,jibalis,Has to be the worst movie I have ever seen,7/10,27 January 2016,"When it comes to this, it seems that there really isn't much of substance to this movie. Various things happen, a lot of commotion on the screen, but where do they ultimately lead? What is the bigger picture? Truth is that there isn't even a bigger picture. What we see, is all that is and it is nothing particularly exciting even if they try to mask the hollowness behind a bunch of explosions, shootings and other stuff. To be honest, I see no difference between this Star Wars movie or any average Michael Bay movie. Plot wise it's about as deep as Transformers. We have got Harisson Fordie back and Carrie Fisher and that weird blonde dude. Carrie used to be smoking in the 80's. I mean, she does look a bit like a farmer from 19th century, but in that slave outfit, even if the movie was bland as hell, I could still enjoy the sight of her cleavage. But now she's 60 and that sight isn't particularly attractive to me anymore. And Ford? He used to be such a man in the 80's. But now he's just an old man, who looks like he should be at a retirement home watching TV with other old people. And the blonde dude is just as annoying as he was. He ain't a Jedi. Just a farm boy. This movie really lacks in every department imaginable. How you suppose for me to enjoy a piece like this when there's nothing beyond the sparkling facade? Where's the emotion? Where's the depth? In my opinion Star Wars has to be one of the worst franchises imaginable and I will never associate myself with any person that belongs to it's fan base.",Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,2488496
82,LouieInLove,Disney's Hype Wars Won. Star Wars Did Not - A Safe Corporate Exercise In Entertainment.,3/10,4 April 2016,"Following the mass-marketing campaign extraordinaire, I truly was fooled into believing this was a fantastic movie before I saw it. I believed the hype, that this was a Star Wars returned to form.....It is not! Story-wise it falls short of the prequels, never mind the original films. It truly is a Disney Star Wars. It's an almost sickeningly safe corporate exercise in entertainment with none of the original edge & flare/excitement. The original was based on old Saturday morning swash-buckling matinée series, with heroes & beautiful heroines. This Star Wars gave us a flat-chested car mechanic who looks like a teenage choirboy, a ham-acting ex-storm-trooper & Princess Leia re-imagined as a General. It's just soulless & flat & scared of its own shadow! Basically they've taken the original story, sucked all the sexiness out of it & punched & squeezed it into a corporate 'Disney' box.All stories must have accessibility, they must allow you to buy into the imaginings & in this 'The Force Awakens' fails miserably as it has hacked clumsily away at the origin story to suit its new safe Disney Star Wars universe.Booo!",Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,2488496
83,scottalvord,Everything we know and love about Star Wars,10/10,10 November 2017,"I'll be honest, in the months leading up to the release of JJ Abrams sequel I was growing increasingly skeptical about his ability to do the film justice. But after finally seeing it, I was SERIOUSLY impressed! Abrams is clearly a loyal, highly intelligent fan of the saga, and has done all Star Wars fans a great service. The pacing and flow of the film is a mixture of the original and prequel trilogy, and left me almost wishing Abrams had taken the reigns for the prequels as well. It is amazingly written and directed with stunning visuals and cinematography.The action is fast paced and flawless (the space battle scenes and light saber duels especially) and the story woven with emotion and the best occasional gags and one liners to date. I particularly enjoyed the character of Kylo Ren and was left begging for more backstory and information on this confused and helpless villain People certainly loved to point out downfalls in George Lucas' prequels, but it's factually obvious Abrams has completely delivered on all fronts in doing the saga justice! 10/10",Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,2488496
84,toddfulton-09348,Real Star Wars fans got the sequel we always wanted. Therefore (as always) I win......you lose X- ),10/10,4 September 2017,"With this absolute epic, Star Wars.....is......back! JJ Abrams achieved a small miracle in creating a movie that respects its original material, brings in a ton of new characters, makes it appealing for new viewers and sets up a story to build a new Star Wars trilogy on. Without giving away too many spoilers, the story revolves around a scavenger (Rey), a renegade stormtrooper(Finn) and a fighter pilot(Poe) in their quest to defeat an enemy with the power to endanger the galaxy. To be honest, actual great acting has never been a strong point in any of the previous Star Wars movies. This trend has thankfully been broken, as the stellar cast give great performances throughout the whole movie. The newcomers Daisy Ridley and John Boyega, playing as Rey and Finn respectively, prove themselves more than capable of carrying the load in continuing the saga. They both show great chemistry together and give us extremely likable characters, with Rey bringing the heart of the film and Finn the abundant energy. Oscar Isaacs, who plays Poe, is the veteran among the young cast and pulls of a cool and smart-ass X-wing pilot. And finally, the old cast returns to give this film a true Star Wars feel to it. Harrison Ford returns as Han Solo and has not seemed to skip a beat since 1983, as he is as cheeky and bad-ass as ever. His witty banter with Chewbacca is a pleasure to watch, but Ford also brings a strong emotional performance this time too. Carrie Fisher as Leia also returns, in a rather small role, and delivers some sweet scenes with Han and the new cast. However, the most complex character with the best arc in this movie, is the antagonist Kylo Ren. Ren, played by Adam Driver, gives us an extremely intimidating villain with a troubled past we are eager to discover. Ultimately, he serves us more than a Darth Vader wannabe. JJ Abrams alongside Lawrence Kasdan wrote a fun and entertaining screenplay with plenty of emotional plot twists and content. Each main character has its own background and motivation, which develops over the duration of the film. A pleasant surprise to see is the humor used in the movie. The comedic relief in the film was used very effectively in developing chemistry and sympathy for the characters. It is also a sign that the movie does not take itself too seriously as the prequels did. The Force Awakens is filled with exhilarating action and moves with great pace during these scenes. Yet, Abrams knows to slow it down during scenes conveying intense emotion giving the audience time to process all that is thrown at them. These combined make it easy to understand the main characters' motivations, making the emotional investment so much better. As is typical of Star Wars, the movie is full of awe inspiring visual images and astonishing sound editing, creating new sounds for laser beams, light sabers, and alien noises. The cinematography is equally impressive, showing beautiful landscape shots of new planets reminiscent of the original trilogy. The cinematographer also shows us a diverse array of shots, giving heart- pounding POV shots inside the cockpit and nice long shots of the battlefield giving it a great scope while avoiding confusion caused by the numerous explosions. John Williams makes a welcome return to the Star Wars franchise with a bombastic new score, but also with nicely timed inserts of his famous original music to bring up emotional heartwarming feeling among the old-school fans. In conclusion, The Force Awakens is a return to greatness for the Star Wars franchise. This beautiful reunion of old characters combined with the introduction of promising new characters results in an emotional, adventure trip that left me excited for what is coming next. To quote Jimmy Kimmel, this movie was probably ""the most anticipated sequel since the New Testament"". So expect this movie to be under the most intense scrutiny by reviewers as they dissect the movie to its core to find the tiniest (I.E. laughably non-existent) flaws. In the end, The Force Awakens delivers as a fantastic Star Wars film and an incredibly worthy addition to the franchise.",Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,2488496
85,savo-72109,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time!,10/10,13 October 2017,"I usually don't do reviews but there is an overwhelming amount of bad reviews of people who obviously have too much time to write books about how bad they thought this movie was, but in my opinion they don't do this film justice by giving it these bad reviews.But everyone is entitled to his or her opinion. I think there is a difference between not liking a movie subjectively and to simply just trashing it because of it. And I think that doth not make a review at all. It is just hateful for personal reasons.J.J Abrams, Disney aside, has realized a movie that is not only aesthetically beautiful but also the characters, the story-telling, the build-up of the characters is in many ways what I wanted to see after the debacle of episodes 1-3, aside the great performances by Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor.With its anamorph film look, going back to the old movies with the many humorous moments between the characters, the gorgeous film stills, the characters we love such as Han Solo, Chewbacca and great new characters such as Ray, Finn a.s.o.Of course there are some things that could have been done better. There is basically always something that can be done better in every movie. Also in episodes 4-6, except if you are blinded by your nostalgia fandom of the old movies. The old movies are great and are a true pinnacle of sci-fi movies and a true inspiration for so many movies that could not have been possible without them.I watched this movie without trying to compare it to the old ones, I mean seriously how could you compare it. They were made a few decades ago.I think this movie is great and I am eager to see how the story unfolds.",Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,2488496

The special effects are tastefully done, and are a perfect follow on from its predecessors. Nostalgia rules in this thrilling film, we felt like applauding several times throughout, and got goosebumps in some amazing scenes. It was also surprisingly humorous, (in appropriate amounts), and the balance of new characters versus returning characters and story lines was brilliant. 10 out of 10 for me!

The cinematography was too movementy. Unlike the smoothness in the other ones.2. No impactful soundtrack. I like JW, but this felt he missed out.3. Lack of originality in the story. Death star... oops sorry death planet, done before and all. Hell! It makes the story lines of the games (like knights of the old republic 1-2, Jedi Outcast and Jedi Academy - even shadow of the empire) and various novels feel like classic.4. The fact that Rei defeated villain with no extensive(or even an hour) training.5. R2D2's sudden awakening and conveniently having the rest of the map only at the climax.6. The ending shot was way too fast. all the others had slow or no movement at all.The Good: 1. Visual Quality. 2. Production and locations. 3. Visual effects 4. Action sequences 5.

J.J added his genius, unique touch. As he did with Star Trek 2009 + Into Darkness.It did a wonderful job bridging the gap to a new story. Practical effects were 10/10.
