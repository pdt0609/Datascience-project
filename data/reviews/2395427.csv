0,Abdulxoxo,The most important film in MCU,8/10,2 December 2020,"As I was watching this movie today, I realized it's one of the most important film in mcu. It has tons of elements that are used heavily in future MCU films, egFleshing out HawkeyeÂ°In this film we get to see the other side of Hawkeye, we learn about his family, who would played a vital role to his character's dark turn in Endgame.Â°This movie also solidifies his relationship with Black Widow which makes her demise in endgame even more impactful.Â°He also inspired Wanda to shake off her past and become an Avenger.
The arising tension between Steve and TonyÂ° Things started to get sour between Steve and Tony, after him and Bruce accidentally created Ultron and also Vision. And the destruction of Sokovia at the end of the movie is also one of the main reason for the Sokovia Accords, which are all part of the reason that split the superheroes in two sides in CW.
Intro of Scarlett Witch and VisionÂ°Vision and Scarlett are both introduced in this film, and they both would go on and become crucial members of the Avengers.Thanos had enoughÂ° The events of this film upset Thanos so much that he decided to ""do it himself"" which foreshadows the event of Infinity War.
Avengers as a unitÂ°It's also the first appearance of the Avengers functional as a team. They're not just meeting and building the team like in the first Avengers, they aren't split like in Civil War and Infinity War or broken like in Endgame. They're just out there taking on bad guys, hanging out, and fighting evil robots.
Hulk/Bruce banner story arcÂ°Bruce Banner started having problems transforming into the Hulk in this movie which keeps recurring in Infinity War, until ultimately resolved at Endgame.Â°Hulk buster armorÂ°At the end of this film, Hulk left on the quinjet which from there, you know, Ragnorak.
Wakanda/ Black panther teaseÂ°Klaw is first introduced in this film, he would go on to become one of Black panther's main villain. Wakanda and vibranium are mentioned as well.
Black widow's arcÂ°Flashback scenes of Black Widow's years of training might be further explored in the her upcoming solo movie.Ragnarok:Â°Heimdall first teases Ragnarok and the fact they will lose in Thor's vision, which prompted him to fly back home to Asgard.
Ironman to save everyoneÂ°The visions of defeat he saw in this film haunt him, but he was, in the end, able to use that fear to defeat Thanos in Endgame, thus saving everyone.
Â°Captain almost picking up Mjolnir.Â°The first mention of the word ""Endgame"".
At the time of its release it was met with mixed reviews mostly because it was too muddy, yeah it had to to tell its own story, all while setting up the next four years of Marvel films. This movie deserve nothing but our utmost respect. ðŸ™Œ",Avengers: Age of Ultron,2395427
1,r96sk,An enjoyable ride,7/10,18 January 2021,"Cool seeing them all together again, even if I didn't massively enjoy it. It's good, nothing more or less in my opinion.'Avengers: Age of Ultron' isn't too far off 2012's 'The Avengers', especially in terms of how I fell about it. I definitely wanted more from both, yet they are still satisfying superhero action flicks. I'd rank this narrowly below the aforementioned.Robert Downey Jr. felt a little flat to me as Iron Man - he still has a decent amount of moments, just not as many as you get in his individual films. All the others continue to entertain to an equally suitable level, I didn't overly like the characters of Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen but I also don't have any noteworthy negatives about them. The story between Scarlett Johansson and Mark Ruffalo didn't do much for me either.With that noted, it is still an enjoyable ride through the 141 minute run time. The ending is intriguing, interested to see where that goes - I have a minor inkling about the mid-credits scene, given all the internet attention that has had - even for someone like me who knows very little overall.",Avengers: Age of Ultron,2395427
2,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Messier, for sure, but still plenty of ""Avengers"" fun",7/10,8 May 2016,"The task of bringing together Earth's mightiest heroes took Joss Whedon into uncharted territory with 2012's ""The Avengers,"" and, despite the weight of the Marvel Cinematic Universe on his shoulders, the results were staggeringly entertaining. The task of making a sequel to that ground-breaking, monumental event film, however, and being expected to deliver on par or better results, is an entirely different beast.""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" was definitely built on the bullet point takeaways of ""The Avengers,"" which are: Make time and space for wit, banter and humor for the sake of humor to prevent the film from taking itself too seriously; give each character a story arch and independent moments; choreography clever action sequences with well-timed glory shots. These components are in full force in ""Ultron"" and make enjoying the blockbuster as easy as shoving a lollipop in your mouth.Yet ""Ultron"" is infinitely more complex than its predecessor. The number of heroes featured barely fits into a single action figure play case, meaning more subplots and back story, in addition to creating an arch of the creation and life of Ultron itself. With a plot that takes the Avengers from the eastern European country of ""Sokovia"" to New York to the African nation of ""Wakanda"" to Seoul, South Korea to Sokovia again, much of ""Age of Ultron"" is a non-stop blur.The film opens with the Avengers leading an assault on a secret HYDRA facility where they have located the staff that Loki used to lead the Chitauri invasion in ""The Avengers."" When they secure it and bring it back to New York, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) discover that its power source contains a blueprint for artificial intelligence, which would allow Stark to proceed with his Ultron project, an initiative to create peace-keeping robots that could defend the world in place of the Avengers should another alien invasion occur. When Ultron (voiced by James Spader) becomes conscious, however, he interprets his peace-keeping instructions as an imperative to wipe out humankind.Added to the mix are the Maximoff twins, Pietro (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Wanda (Elizabeth Olsen) â€“ also known as Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch â€“ who decide to serve Ultron, with the latter using her powers to give each of the Avengers dangerous visions that could tear them apart.The fight scenes and action sequences are in such abundance in ""Ultron"" that it's impossible to remember them all, and the ones that are most distinct, such as Iron Man chasing down and taming a rampant Hulk using his Hulkbuster armor, are ancillary to the narrative of finding what Ultron is up to and stopping it. In other words â€“ it's all for show. The creativity of the fight choreography also gets lost in the whirlwind of action. Captain America (Chris Evans) probably does 12 different awesome things with his shield, but they happen so fast you'll be hard pressed to recall any one of them in detail. Really clever sequences are only as fun as the build-up and payoff and those pieces are given no time to breathe.Whedon does allow for pauses in the chaos, such as the swanky Avengers Tower party featuring the film's best scene, when each Avenger tries his hand at lifting Thor's hammer, or a quiet retreat to an unexpected safe house in the countryside, but it's simply a trade- off: instead of busy action sequences, we get character relationship dynamics and back story.""Ultron"" is inundating, to be frank, but for the everything-but-the-sink mentality, it's carried by its sense of humor and a cast whose members have each proved themselves time and again to be magnetic both on their own and as part of this team. Some of the novelty has worn off, but seeing all these characters together remains a treat that even the most convoluted of stories cannot entirely dismantle. Marvel Studios truly proves with ""Ultron"" the credibility that it has built with fans, to the point that even when it gets a little ambitious and mettles a bit more (you can easily see Whedon at odds with them in this final cut), its reputation remains intact and the fans placated.As ""Phase III"" begins, adding even more characters to Marvel's cinematic universe (and even sliding Spider-Man into the mix) en route to the two-part ""Avengers: Infinity War"" slated for 2018 and 2019, it will be interesting to see if Marvel Studios barrels along into more unwieldy but delicious chaos, or reins it in a touch. Either way, should be fun.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more",Avengers: Age of Ultron,2395427
3,sammielimehouse,Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) Review - 8.3/10,8/10,12 December 2020,"This film isn't nearly as bad as some people make it out to be. While the story isn't as good as the first Avengers, the acting is still just as good, the action is even better, and Ultron isn't a bad villain, he's just an under-developed one. Honestly, the action makes up for most of the flaws of this movie and it also set up a lot of MCU films, or at least foreshadowed a lot. Movies like Black Panther, Avengers: Infinity War/Endgame, and Captain America: Civil War. Overall, this isn't a bad film, at all, but it is the weakest of The Avengers franchise.

4,xamtaro,The son of Megatron and Skynet meets Tony Stark and his Amazing Friends,6/10,14 December 2015,"In 2012, there came a day unlike any other day where the worlds greatest heroes were united against a common threat and THE AVENGERS blew away audiences of all ages with the first ever comic book movie crossover. In 2015, there came another day unlike any other day and this time the world is threatened by a Ultron, the cynical critical atypical child of Skynet and Megatron...... No actually he's just a wisecracking artificial intelligence with delusions of godhood and all round evil. Turning on his creators, he threatens all life on earth with his sidekicks ""illusion- woman"" and ""not-the-flash""....I mean, Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver, and it is up to the Avengers to take him out before he can usher in THE AGE OF ULTRON. Instead of the robot dominated dystopian future that we saw in the comics, what we do get is more ""the next few days of Ultron"". No matter, it is an exciting few days with director Joss Whedon balancing the intercharacter dynamics with awesome action pieces from claustrophobic close combat, to a freeway chase, to the much advertised no holds barred beat down between the Hulk and iron man's new ""hulk buster"" Armour. All this is supplemented with beautiful special effects from Industrial Lights and Magic ILM. Flawless work befitting the movie's massive Budget.In The villain, Ultron, the Writers have crafted a memorable though under utilised bad guy. Ultron could have been the vehicle to explore deeper themes, themes that were merely hinted at but never fleshed out. Instead, His cynical yet refined snarling courtesy of James Spader reminds me of the those magnificently passionate Super villains that were so common in Saturday morning cartoons of old.And that is exactly what this is. AGE OF ULTRON can be described as a true live action cartoon. The dialogue is light hearted, the story is straightforward, the tone is fun and the action is immense. And this is not exactly a good thing. Intense scenes are interrupted and spoilt with poorly placed humour and once again the story does not seem to take itself seriously. Fights are over-choreographed, more like some fancy ballet than an all out battle. The fact that it cuts to graceful slow motion once in a while only emphasises the dance like nature of the fights. And yet the movie felt like pieces of it were cut out. The narrative does not flow as smoothly as the first with inexplicable scenes like Thor suddenly going off on his hallucination trip. Much of the premise and the characters development up to this point very much depends on the viewer watching prior marvel movies. It is here that Marvel studio's continuity heavy Creative direction rears its ugly head. To know what is going on in this movie, one would have to watch the previous movies. Captain America the winter soldier, iron man 3, the first avengers movie. But perhaps that's the point? Force people to go buy the Blu rays or the video to rewatch and get up to speed. In the end, the real big winner is distributor Disney. Ka-Ching $$.I like a good comedy. In in a big action blockbuster, I like to believe that the stakes are real, that the dangers faced by our heroes are real, that they are really fighting for the fate of the world. Instead, we get this cartoony violence, with equally cartoony superficial story, where heroes joke around with quick lighthearted quips in the middle of a fight scene where people could die. This kills tension. And if it weren't for the magnificent effects, action and direction, AGE OF ULTRON would have scored a bit lower.",Avengers: Age of Ultron,2395427
5,andreascaloni,VERY GOOD SEQUEL,7/10,21 April 2021,"In Avengers Age of Ultron the Avengers fight Ultron, an artificial intelligence obsessed with causing human extinction. The movie is a mostly satisfying sequel. It's full of action and darker than the first one. Sometimes it has a great sense of humour, the main villain is well characterized and the final act is full of tension and emotional. However in the first half isn't always gripping and there are some ridicolous moments. It isn't as good as the first one but it's still a fun and entertaining ride to join.Rating: 7,4.

6,Top_Dawg_Critic,Not one of the top Avengers films,7/10,10 September 2018,"One user nailed it... underwhelming. What also really bothered me was Ultron's voice and character. Seemed too childish and immature for a villain. His humor was also cheesy.Still a decent film, but certainly not one of my favorite Avengers films.7/10 from me.

7,ivo-cobra8,"Avengers: Age of Ultron is a damn good Superhero flick, excellent sequel!",10/10,8 May 2016,"Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) is a MARVEL damn good superhero flick and an excellent sequel! Yes it is miles way better than Jurassic World and Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Terminator Genisys I have enjoyed this film much better than Jurassic World, Star Wars and Terminator the new movies. This film is fun, popcorn, Action and entertaining action sequel flick. I like the first one but I love this one much more. The first time I watch it, I did not like this film at all, it did not work for me, but the second time around this flick was awesome and it become one of my favorite MARVEL superhero movies. I love this film so much, more than the first Avengers. James Spader made the movie for me! So much better than Loki. 
James Spader and Robert Downey Jr. played together in a teen movie Tuff Turf in 1985 and 30 years later they teamed together to star in a MARVEL comic book super hero film. I like Tuff Turf but Avengers: Age of Ultron is far way better film to me. I love this film so much and I will never get the backlash. Joss Whedon gave me everything I wanted in a sequel. This and the first film are in my top 10 films of all time. I waited a long time for this universe and I am loving every minute of it. Superhero movies come out all time but something like this is what I love about movies. 
Plot: Tony Stark creates the Ultron Program to protect the world, but when the peace-keeping program becomes hostile, The Avengers go into action to try and defeat a virtually impossible enemy's to get. Earth's mightiest heroes must come together once again to protect the world from global extinction. I really enjoy this movie I don't get the backslash and a lot of people were disappointed with this sequel that it is not so good as the first film. Age of Ultron is in my top 3 favorite comic book films. Number 1 will always be Captain America: The Winter Soldier and number 2 will be Captain America: The First Avenger, I just love those two films: Captain America is my favorite superhero character in MARVEL comic books. Captain America in this movie is the most decent hero in this movie, he did not want the leave the island with people stuck on it, he refused too, I have seen a hero in him. People are keep getting upset over Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), ""oh look what they did with Black Widow."" I saw the film and I am seeing her kicking ass or calm down the Hulk, which is a pretty ballsy thing to do. Specially for someone who has no balls and she is kicking ass and driving motorcycle, driving around shooting for Cap, helping them to get vision android to beat Ultron and she is the only one with no powers, except Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), she has the to get the thing for them. I think it would be weird to kidnapped Thor, if you put Thor in the scene duh. I enjoy this movie much more than the first film, the first film I liked okay, I like the first Avengers film. This is a fun popcorn entertainment flick that I really love. 
I like the romance between Black Widow with Hulk it was really good fast paced entertainment. I love Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda Maximoff / Scarlet Witch I like the twist by the end of the film that she turn her side around when she found out that Ultron wants to destroy everything on this planet I love that. You have Aaron Taylor-Johnson in it from Kick-Ass film as Pietro Maximoff / Quicksilver sadly he dies on the end of the film, but he saves Hawkeye and a kid from Ultron firing bunch of bullets on them I thought that was pretty decent in the film. In my opinion Aaron Taylor-Johnson did a good job playing his character. I love that they return Samuel L. Jackson to the movie back as Nick Fury and that he help them out fighting Ultron. James Spader did a terrific excellent job playing Ultron.Avengers: Age of Ultron is a 2015 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics superhero team the Avengers, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. It is the sequel to 2012's The Avengers and the eleventh film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). You have a lot of action in it, I also love that Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, Thor, Bruce Banner (Hulk), Natasha Romanoff, and Clint Barton work together after Ultron failed to destroy them and they go in to safe house to Clinton's family, I like that. When Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) touches Black Widow, Iron Man and Thor I like that you see a background of Natasha Romanoff's childhood, I like that. I love the African shipyard you see them on a ship and I love the last stand. I love that the Vision helps Avengers to destroy and stop Ultron from extinction. Btw I love to death Black Widow / Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) she is so beautiful and charming I love her.
Overall: I am giving this flick 10 out of 10 for me Age of Ultron is my #3 favorite super hero movie. I can't wait for the next movie: Captain America: Civil War.",Avengers: Age of Ultron,2395427
8,sam_smithreview,"What a Shame, we live where Studio's take control",5/10,26 April 2016,"being a huge Marvel fan, and also Josh Whedon fan I was super excited for him to come back and do another Avengers movie. The first film was pretty brilliant. But with this film, Whedon wasn't given much air to breathe, with constant Studio interference and orders of certain shots to be re- done, or scrapped if not worse. Put in.So, you thinking why is this film so bad, if you are a fan, you should love it. Well the film changes pace, very quickly and abruptly, which is a poor sign of movie making. The Characters do not act like they would usually act in the same scenario, the progression of the story is all over the place, Scene's that just have no weight or meaning to the film, but in there because it looks cool or is setting up another independent super hero movie, the Villain that is so smart, but doesn't use the internet and his ability to control everything just to wipe out everybody, but rather has this ridiculously stupid plan. The Hero's that are suppose to be smart, intelligent and some what Spanish do not see all of the stupid plot hole that get infiltrated. The fighting was also a problem for me, it was the same. Once you saw it in the first Avengers, you see exact same thing in the second one too, and it doesn't even change a little.Overall, this film is bunched up due to the constant interference by Studio as Josh has stated so many times now.",Avengers: Age of Ultron,2395427
9,A_Different_Drummer,Assorted Trivia for AV2....,9/10,25 April 2015,"Can this film possibly ""not"" succeed? No. Even if it were a bomb (which it is most definitely not) tens of millions of fans would see it anyway. So it was a guaranteed hit. Nice work if you can get it.Best line? ""I support your avenging."" (Mrs. Hawkeye)Second Best line? ""You get hurt. Hurt em back. You get killed. Walk it off."" (CA)Third Best? ""Well I was born yesterday."" (you know who)Honorable mention? ""Beep beep"" (Natasha on her cycle, mimicking her horn, trying to warn pedestrians)Why did Spader get the Ultron gig? Because of his incredible work in Blacklist. (See it)What's the best part of this (somewhat long) movie? The back-and-forth between the characters, a Whedon trademark. And of course the action scenes. Possibly the best ever filmed.What's the worst part? The 40 minute ""dead zone"" after the Bond-style opening, where the Avengers try to make like it's Happy Hour at the local bar.Which actor consistently shines? Downey. He is the smartass each of secretly wants to hang out with.Which actor suffers the most in group play? Thor. The gravitas of being a God gets lost in team work.Name a massively over-exposed actor who finally got under-exposed? Sam Jackson.What could we have lived without? ""Explaining"" to the audience why characters like Pepper Potts were ""unavailable"" for the story (or possibly too expensive even for a quick cameo)What is Whedon's greatest enhancement to the Marvel backstory? The romance between Natasha and Hulk.What is Whedon's strangest tweak? Killing Pietro. The boys at the X-Men franchise will not be happy.Is this a better movie than AV1? No, but it is just as good. (It tries harder but has pacing issues).Who wins at the end? The studio. And Joss Whedon who BOTH wrote and directed what could be the biggest money-maker in history. Somewhere in Hollywood, JJ Abrams is actually getting nervous.-------------------------------------------------------------------UPDATED Jan 16 -- OK, so JJ deconstructed the original Star Wars script scene by scene (something no one else had ever bothered to do) and rebuilt it into the 2015 relaunch of Star Wars. And nailed it. The viewer experience, the pacing, is dead-on. And oh by the way produced the fastest film in history to hit 1.0 billion in ticket sales. So disregard the last line of the original review above. JJ is no longer nervous.",Avengers: Age of Ultron,2395427
10,siderite,"Action followed by action then, surprisingly, some character development. Then some more action.",8/10,21 August 2015,"So everybody must be asking now: ""Is it worth watching more than two hours of this just to get to the obligatory Thanos end credits scene?"" and the answer is... yes. Besides making fun of War Machine - again - and completely ignoring characters like Pepper Potts and Falcon, there was nothing that bothered me tremendously about this film. Keep in mind that it is a comic book film with superheros that dress funny, though.The villain is pretty menacing, the interaction between the Avengers goes well beyond killing enemies in each other's blind spot and the Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver addition was interesting, though kind of condescending. I mean, if they want to ban Tin-tin cartoons for racist depictions of African people, they should stop at one moment or another inventing countries with Slavic names and filling them with helpless women and children with names just as ridiculous and toy soldier police and army forces. I am just saying.What I thought was better than I was expecting from an Avengers movie were the underlying character stories. Thanks to Scarlet Witch we see bits of our heros' histories, we get to know Hawkeye a little better and understand his role in a team of superpowered individuals, he see the romantic side of Black Widow and the Hulk... yes, you read that right... and we get to see Captain America and Tony Stark having ideological arguments that divide the team. Of course, they carry them with vibranium shield throws and energy beams, like men do... don't they?I loved the character of The Vision, a freak hybrid between a servile AI and a full psycho AI, holding the power of an Infinity Stone and having a 3D printed body that is half alive, half vibranium. I share his view of humanity as queer pets that you have to enjoy during their short life.What I didn't like is that they upped the ante of what the Avengers can do, just because they could. In the end this diminished the level of empathy that one can feel for superhumans like that and removed from the quality of storytelling. Also, another film in which artificial intelligence builds bodies and kills people. Why would it? Ultron's motivation was completely unexplored and his philosophy and references to Pinocchio made no sense at all. OK, it was meant to be insane, but even insanity has purpose and sense. Overall, I think the biggest problem with the film was that it had too much of a budget.Bottom line: brainless fun, but fun nonetheless. Less humor than expected, with Ultron teasing an interesting character with his jokes, but then devolving to a classic villain in the sea of special effects that filled most of the movie. You get to know the Avengers more, as well, which was nice.",Avengers: Age of Ultron,2395427
11,Theo Robertson,Never As Profound As It Thinks It Is,5/10,28 April 2015,"I really should keep up on Superhero movies . But there's a reason I don't - I simply don't like them . They personify everything I dislike about modern Hollywood blockbusters , lots of explosions , lots of stunts and lots of CGI . It's less like watching a film and more like logging on to youtube and watching gameplay of the latest state of the art computer game AVENGERS AGE OF ULTRON gets off to the exact start I'm talking about . Most of the iconic Marvel Superheroes - and the audience are thrust in to an opening action sequence . It's very vague what this mission is , something about East European baddies in league with Hydra working on some artificial intelligence . Ignore the narrative because the opening involves lots of stunts , ramping and explosions with the occasional one liner thrown in . You want action you've got it . You want intelligent , stimulating storytelling ? Go and read a book . I can understand what the producers are pandering to but I found this pre-title sequence rather uninvolving and the rest of the film continues in the same way One thing the film does try and do is merge high concept action with character driven moments . On paper it does have a relatively good cast and it'd be a pity to waste it on overblown action but it's not really an actors type of film and while the production team deserves some credit for trying to concentrate on character but it's not developed enough to be entirely successful and comes across as rather shallow Despite this short review I'm big enough to stick up my hand and say this movie isn't produced for grumpy , middle aged men like myself , it's produced for younger people who can't get enough superhero movies and for this market the prospective audience will probably love it so much so that that'll be a contender for biggest grossing film of 2015 and we'll be getting more Marvel movies for the foreseeable future",Avengers: Age of Ultron,2395427
12,claudio_carvalho,Impressive Special Effects and Cast,8/10,6 September 2015,"The Avengers raid a Hydra base in Sokovia commanded by Strucker and they retrieve Loki's scepter. They also discover that Strucker had been conducting experiments with the orphan twins Pietro Maximoff (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), who has super speed, and Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen), who can control minds and project energy. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) discovers an Artificial Intelligence in the scepter and convinces Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) to secretly help him to transfer the A.I. to his Ultron defense system. However, the Ultron understands that is necessary to annihilate mankind to save the planet, attacks the Avengers and flees to Sokovia with the scepter. He builds an armature for self-protection and robots for his army and teams up with the twins. The Avengers go to Clinton Barton's house to recover, but out of the blue, Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) arrives and convinces them to fight against Ultron. Will they succeed? ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" is an entertaining adventure with impressive special effects and cast. The storyline might be better, since most of the characters do not show any chemistry. However, it is worthwhile watching this film since the amazing special effects are not possible to be described in words. Why Pietro has to die is also not possible to be explained. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Vingadores: Era de Ultron"" (""Avengers: Age of Ultron"")",Avengers: Age of Ultron,2395427
13,rannynm,Another Monumental Marvel Movie!,10/10,29 April 2015,"The Avengers assemble once again go up against a new corrupt, A.I. Ultron (James Spader). As the troupe pursue their mission, we're given a deeper understanding of our favorite super heroes. There are not enough words in the world to express how happy I am. As a Marvel fan, this film showcases some of my favorite comic book characters together in one plot line in a bigger and better way. When you are dealing with a sequel, as a filmmaker, you're pretty much trying to top yourself. Thankfully, the filmmakers have out done themselves here. We're given a superior conflict, more characters and action beyond epic proportions. I love this movie not only because it's a phenomenal Marvel film, but also an outstanding film in general. A movie is supposed to grab the audience and transport them to a universe with characters that not only we look up to but also identify with. Marvel has successfully created this reality. Every time I see a Marvel logo on a movie poster I'm excited to be sent back, once again, into their universe. Marvel is a genius entertainment company because they establish their characters in previous films. The Avengers are the protagonist. Every character is given their moment in the lime light but, they are not the main focus. They all share the screen and have their own personal conflict, yet they respond as team. That is not to say that there is no character development, there is. Former story lines help save time so that the writers can focus on perfecting the current story. This also leads to much stronger relationships between the characters. For people who have no history with Marvel films, I suggest that you see some of the previous films that feature the Avengers. The reason is that you may miss a connection with the characters that can be resolved by watching previous films. Although you will enjoy the action and story even without seeing the previous films, the inside jokes and interactions between characters become funnier when you understand the past. The action in this film is awesome! The word awesome is a very primitive word, but it explains everything. While I love to go to the movies and appreciate storytelling and 3 dimensional characters, there are times when I just want to see things go boom! Every Avenger, with his or her different abilities, works together and kicks butt. An example of this is when Thor hits Captain America's shield and causes a devastating explosion. You have to see it to believe it.My favorite character is, Vision (Paul Bettany) an android created by Ultron. Bettany is originally the voice of J.A.R.V.I.S., Tony Stark's (Robert Downey, Jr.) A.I. companion. Bettany uses his fantastic voice to create Vision. I was excited when I heard he was going to be a new addition to the Avengers team. Not only is the acting and personality spot on, but the costume design is beautiful. There are so many scenes that I adore, but my favorite is when the Avengers, ""get acquainted"" with Vision for the first time. This is the second A.I. the group has encountered and they're unsure if they can trust him. Vision is uncertain himself and gives a speech on why it doesn't matter because they all want to stop Ultron. At the end of his speech there is a comedic pay-off that shows which side Vision is truly on. The moral of the film is, ""The way to peace is not destruction."" Ultron is built for one reason - to create peace in our time. Ultron is confused on how to fulfill that mission and believes the only way to achieve his goal is to wipe out the human race and start over. However, Ultron underestimates the soul of man. I give this 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it to 11- to 18 year- olds. There is language and intense action that younger kids might not be able to handle. Check out this film in theaters May 1 and remember, a true Marvel fan stays to the end of the credits.Reviewed by Keefer B., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

14,drew_atreides,"Solid, if slightly flawed, entry in the Marvel Universe",8/10,4 May 2015,"...Phase 2 of the Marvel movies had been batting .500 for me. I did not enjoy Iron Man 3 or Thor: Dark World, but really dug Guardians of the Galaxy and Captain America: Winter Soldier (Cap 2 is probably the best film in the entire Marvel series!)Based on that, I don't think I am surprised that I came out of Age of Ultron with mixed feelings. Overall it is a solid entry, but it is by no means flawless. The good:Really liked the intro of Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver. I liked the horror-movie tropes tied to Scarlet Witch (she is a Witch afterall!) and Aaron Taylor-Johnson's Quicksilver had a lot of personality.The action, of course, was great. And Hawkeye actually had something to do in this film. The Vision: They did such an incredible job building mystique around this character.The Bad:Wasn't a fan of that extended scene at the Farm. That stopped the movie cold. I know some people say ""It was necessary for character development"", but the previous films had done such a poor job of giving Hawkeye any character that seeing him on the Farm did absolutely nothing for me.The romance: Ugh. Talk about forced. I like Ruffalo's Banner. I really do. I was surprised how much i did in the first Avengers, cause i'm usually not a Ruffalo fan. But I just did not see any chemistry between Ruffalo and Scar-Jo. And where was the build-up to this? Last time we saw these 2 together Hulk was trying to smash Black Widow. Marvel needs to work on their female-story lines.Ultron was kind of a lame villain. I don't think there was enough build-up for him. He just sorta showed up and was evil.Overall: Is it worth seeing in the theatre? Yes of course it is. But it is not without its flaws, and sure doesn't top Cap 2.",Avengers: Age of Ultron,2395427
15,miguelneto-74936,Disappointing,6/10,30 April 2016,"Disappointing, it summarizes Avengers: Age of Ultron, the film is not bad, it's cool just cool, it is frustrating because all the world expected to be better than the first Avengers Ultron which is one of the best villains of the Marvel Comics he is simply poorly executed in this movie, really the film beginning excited about the action scenes, the effects are excellent, the CGI movie is hardly exaggerated, Mercury and another character very badly used, as the scarlet witch for a future in this universe Marvel, the film is unnecessary scenes, the jokes are always in the wrong time it breaks the film's climax, and the end where the Hulk flees the ship hope to explain in the Civil War film, now the worst thing in the movie, Hawkeye it has more space than owed it gets to be ridiculous, he can tip the witch and the mercury that was really ridiculous, the final scene of the movie was good most not enough to thrill, Avengers: Age of Ultron is not even bad, far from it, more we expected so that was better than the first to disappoint.

16,ossie85,Strong sequel,8/10,9 April 2023,"Avengers: Age of Ultron is an underrated film that, while not quite living up to the original Avengers movie, still manages to deliver plenty of humor and superhero action. The movie brings back our favorite heroes, including Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Black Widow, Hawkeye, and the Hulk, as they face off against a new foe - the artificial intelligence program known as Ultron.One of the strongest aspects of this film is its continued focus on the relationships between the Avengers. We see a deeper exploration of the romantic relationship between Black Widow and the Hulk and get to see more of Hawkeye's personal life. These character moments add emotional weight to the action sequences and give the audience more reasons to care about what's happening on the screen.The humor in the movie is well-done, with plenty of witty one-liners and comedic setpieces. Joss Whedon, who wrote and directed the film, has a talent for balancing humor with more dramatic moments, which helps keep the tone of the movie consistent.However, the plot of the film is a bit convoluted, with lots of subplots and new characters introduced in a short amount of time. Additionally, Ultron, while an interesting and dynamic villain, doesn't quite measure up to Loki from the first Avengers movie in terms of character development and overall impact.Despite these criticisms, Avengers: Age of Ultron is still an entertaining and enjoyable superhero movie. It's a fun ride that delivers on action, humor, and heart, and continues to explore the relationships between our favorite heroes. While it may not quite reach the heights of the original Avengers, it's still a worthy addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",Avengers: Age of Ultron,2395427
17,OllieSuave-007,A lackluster superhero flick,4/10,25 July 2016,"This movie takes a long time to gain any steam, with a lot of all talk and no action in the first half of the movie. There is also little suspense and intrigue - just the superheroes pondering and conjuring their next mission, with Tony Stark and Bruce Banner creating a project called Ultron to act as a peacekeeping program serving as the movie's backdrop.The Ultron project goes horribly wrong and the machine takes a mind of its own, threatening to rid the world of humans in attempts to ""save the world"" - something we've heard before.We get to see action slowly trickle in during the second half of the movie slowly - lots of crazy CGI action during the rumbling climax. This film's plot sets the story for the next film, Captain America: Civil War, in motion. However, I thought this film overall lacked the entertainment value due to its extremely slow plot and lackluster story.Grade D",Avengers: Age of Ultron,2395427
18,matt_hew,Same as the first movie (but with robots),3/10,10 May 2016,"It's quite an achievement to make a boring Superhero Movie so well done to all involved.Remember the first average at best Avengers Movie? A baddie in control of the Tesseract uses it and an alien army to try and take over the planet. Whilst this is happening the Avengers are brought together where there are a few internal issues involving having their minds controlled &/or beating each other up, before joining forces to beat the alien threat.Well.... This movie is about a baddie who was in control of the Tesseract which then becomes the catalyst for a new robot baddie and it's robot army trying to destroy the planet. This again creates a few internal issues involving the Avengers having their minds controlled &/or beating each other up, before joining forces to beat the robot threat. It's just the same movie repackaged (again) which tries to be intelligent but comes across as dull. Some of the Avengers presence have little or no no point in being in the movie (Hawkeye just being there for example to offer the others a weekend retreat to go to).But as with the first movie and the upcoming Captain America: Civil War it seems as long as the movie is crammed full of as many Superheroes as possible and they all kick off at some point during the movie, then this is enough to keep an audience happy.Stick with the X-Men at least they make an effort!",Avengers: Age of Ultron,2395427
19,morrison-dylan-fan,The Avengers:Issue 2.,8/10,25 December 2020,"During the break I had from watching the MCU between The Avengers and Captain America: Civil War, (2012 & 2016-both also reviewed) this was the main entry I read that people had problems with. Catching up on the issues I missed in those years on Disney+,I got set to witness the age of Ultron.View on the film:Printing his final Marvel issue, writer/director Joss Whedon is joined by Guardians of the Galaxy (2014-also reviewed) cinematographer Ben Davis,and displays a winning eye for taking the action set-pieces in a increasingly ambitious direction, spread across the screen from the thrilling opening being staged as if it is one-shot.Fighting with the studio for ""The Farm"" sequence to be included, Whedon blends the flawless glossy CGI Action of CBM with stylish whip-pans bouncing on The Avengers disagreements over how to take on Ultron.Expanding the panels from the original The Avengers, the screenplay by Whedon makes the arrival of Ultron, Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver (played by the excellent trio James Spader, Elizabeth Olsen & Aaron Taylor-Johnson, all of whom bring a pulpy menace to the baddies role) feel like a natural fit to the MCU, thanks to the powers of the evil trio, making The Avengers have to question the reality of what they see and hear.Continuing on from some of the themes touched upon in Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014-also reviewed), Whedon wraps his zany quips with a explosive threat from Ultron, who reveals to The Avengers that the days when they could take down one big End Of Level Boss are long gone,thanks to Ultron spreading his tentacles deep into the system, even into the very foundation of The Avengers.",Avengers: Age of Ultron,2395427
20,ThomasDrufke,The Beginning to the End,9/10,30 April 2015,"This is why I love going to the movies. For two hours, I can forget everything that sucks about the real world and enjoy watching earth's mightiest, (and gosh darn it funniest) heroes (you're welcome Cap for not using the other word). I've always been more of a DC guy, but Marvel movies are just pure entertainment. Joss Whedon may have given us the funniest Marvel movie yet. Whether it was the Thor hammer gag about getting 'it up' or not, Captain America's bad language issues, or Hawkeye poking fun at himself, Age of Ultron was incredibly fun. To top all that, and the first film, Ultron is loaded with action that feels like it's straight out of the comic books.We open with the Avengers mid mission taking down Baron Von Strucker and the experimented on Maximoff twins. As the camera seamlessly weaves through the entire team we get Brian Tyler's brilliantly mixed score, which I was thrilled to hear they salvaged some of Silvestri's theme, that goes with each character. It was like the assemble moment from the first film was happening again within the first 5 minutes, you just don't get much better than that. We quickly get introduced to Scarlet Witch's nightmarish powers with Tony seeing his future of the Avengers dying at his own hands. I do feel like that's a quick nod to Civil War and the possibility of the team going separate ways. Iron Man started it all, so it does seem like the beginning to the end. Throughout the film we get to see different nightmare sequences that give us glimpses of Heimdall played by Idris Elba and the Ragnarok storyline. With Cap we briefly saw Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter and a little bit of the dance we never got to see. Finally with Black Widow and her harsh upbringings as an assassin. On a side note it was cool seeing Julie Delpy in the flashbacks.Onto the possibly the most fun segment of the film, the party scene. Not only did we get several laugh out loud jokes, we had jokes that I missed because everyone was still laughing from before. I'm not even sure Guardians was able to do that. The scene with Thor's hammer was especially entertaining. The look on Thor's face when Cap is able to slightly move it was priceless. Ultron's entrance is terrifying but also sort of funny? I wasn't expecting the humor to Ultron, and I'm not sure I needed it. Don't get me wrong James Spader was fantastic as the voice, but I think at times it didn't fit. The film does indeed go from one action scene too another, and if this isn't your type of movie, I don't blame you if it feels tiresome. But it never bored me as I don't think there will be a more fun movie this year. It's not like action is all we got, we were introduced to a new romance with Hulk and Widow. It's no Gwen and Peter or Pepper and Tony, but I liked the dynamic. Whedon definitely made us care more about each character this time around, as even Hawkeye became a bada**.As a safe house, we were taken to Hawkeye's real home. It was a nice break from the action to spend time with real people without any powers. Hawkeye was just overall a much better character here. After Vision awakens with the mind gem, we head to the final battle. I was glad that this time they were able to find a way to get people to safety, with help from Nick Fury, what an entrance by the way. With so many characters using everyone else's weapons in the battle, it made for one huge geek fest. But it goes to show you how much credit Whedon deserves for balancing all the screen time. Infinity War will be an even bigger challenge, good luck Russo bros. Speaking of that, Thanos' brief but menacing mid credits scene was cool and is a huge tease. I can't wait to see how everything unfolds now that we also have a New Avengers team, led by Cap. Sure Quiksilver wont be around but Vision was really cool and Scarlet Witch was electric so I'm really looking forward to it. Plus who doesn't love a little more Anthony Mackie as well? So there are definitely flaws to be talked about. Thor's detour midway through felt off, Ultron's humor is also out of place at times, and I can see where the action can be exhausting to some, and the amount of characters and cameos make it feel a little messy, but I just had so much fun at the movies. There are also times where things happen that feel like they should have a scene before, explaining it. I hope Joss Whedon puts out his extended 3hr long cut on the bluray. The film also feels at times that it sacrifices brains for action. But there's so much geek material here I don't think I can get too mad. I mean come on, who doesn't love that Hulkbuster fight!? I don't know how long superhero films will be around, so let's enjoy them while we can. What's next? Civil War is next, and I think you can already sense the tension between Cap and Tony. Sure, they end on good terms here, but they never really see eye to eye. Knowing how many are coming back (and possibly Spidey) gets me even more excited. It definitely seems like Avengers 2.5. Nevertheless, go experience this film in theaters.+Hawkeye is cool again +The main theme is back! +New characters turned out great +Hilarious gags +Ultron can be terrifying +New Avengers+Insane action -Some detours feel off -Ultron's humor was too out of place at times Critic score 9.5/10.

21,coreyjdenford,Avengers re-assemble.,8/10,24 April 2015,"Avengers:Age of Ultron my just be the best film of 2015 it started off great with a lot of action. Why I think this is the best superhero sequel ever.Okay first thing this film is action packed there is a lot more action than the first one so basically the story is still there but the action literally takes over.Second thing is the Hulkbuster now you may be thinking is it as awesome as it looks on the trailer the answer is yes...it is a lot more awesome than on the trailer and plus that action sequence goes on for quite some time. Third thing Ultron now Ultron may have been toned down to how he was in the comics but in this film he is still as malevolent and vicious as ever but with limits obviously with it being PG-13. Ultron in this film is played by James Spader and he doesn't lack at all you can still tell that Ultron is one of the most dangerous villain The Avengers have ever faced. Fourth thing the plot the film this time doesn't rely too much on it's story it's more the action that builds the film obviously there is still a story and it's a very good one there are some bits where the film slows down for it but that is really what a superhero film is about especially generation, when we rely on origin stories in superhero films. Fifth and final thing does it feel like too much Disney? the answer for that question is no it doesn't see the first film really felt like it was too much Disney but in this film it's a lot darker than the first film because you see some of The Avengers literally feel pain. Plus the first film was more of a full on introduction to The Avengers and what they do. This film is far from Disney now and well in that case that's better I did love the first film too. If you are a superhero fan and loved Ultron in the comics then you are going to love him even more in the film. This film was worth every penny and I think that well mainly superhero fans should go see this movie don't wait for it to come out on DVD just go see because it is amazing and is far better than the first. 8/10 must see superhero film.",Avengers: Age of Ultron,2395427
22,kaden_lewis,Avengers: Age of Ultron,9/10,21 June 2021,"Why all the hate? I know this is isn't on the level of ""The Avengers"" but it was still really good. I enjoyed the plot and story of this movie, I liked how we were introduced to new actors, and I also liked that we sort of got s glimpse into the franchises future. I thought the plot of needing to stop a ultra peace keeping robot from trying to make the human race extinct for peace was really good, and I think James Spader did a great job playing the role. I also liked the story of the movie to go along with it. Another thing I liked was that we were introduced to Wanda and Pietro Maximoff (Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver). I also though the acting from Elisabeth Olsen and Aaron Taylor-Johnson was great. It sucks we had to lose Pietro, he didn't even need to die, I feel the writers were just looking for a reason to write home out. I also liked how we got a little look into the future of the franchise with the Avengers trip to Wakanda. The last thing I liked about this movie was when Wanda gave most of the Avengers their dream sequences, sure, they were a little weird, but I thought they were pretty cool.All in all, this was a great sequel, and I have no clue why Marvel fans were so hard on it, I definitely watching it, if you have seen the first one.",Avengers: Age of Ultron,2395427
23,namashi_1,A Major Disappointment!,5/10,24 April 2015,"If disappointment had lost a literal definition, it would be 'Avengers: Age of Ultron'. A lazy, soulless sequel, that shames its prequel & also the prolific superheroes. Despite the best of graphics & stars in hand, this summer bigger suffers from a stilted narrative.'Avengers: Age of Ultron' Synopsis: When Tony Stark tries to jump-start a dormant peacekeeping program, things go awry and it is up to the Avengers to stop the villainous Ultron from enacting his terrible plans.'Avengers: Age of Ultron' has only one saving grace & that's its graphics. The visuals are marvelous & the action-sequences are expertly choreographed. But, the narrative is stilted & soulless. Also, the pace is dreadfully slow in the first-hour. I was throughly bored in this hour, almost in disbelief if this one is actually a marvel movie.Joss Whedon's Screenplay is a downer. He made a terrific film previously, but this time around, he has faltered. The Writing Material surrenders to graphics & makes very less use of its own strength. Whedon's Direction, on the other-hand, is fair. Cinematography is alright. Editing is loose, the film runs for a long 142-minutes! The Avengers, however, do well. Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man, donning the part for the fifth time, hasn't lost his charm. Chris Hemsworth as Thor, is excellent here, while Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/Hulk, looks tired. Chris Evans as Steve Rogers / Captain America, has his moments. Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow, is passable. Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton / Hawkeye, is a pleasant surprise here. He actually gets scope to perform this time & he does. Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Quicksilver & Elizabeth Olsen as Scarlet Witch, add freshness in the proceedings. James Spader as Ultron, is the biggest letdown. He gives the villain a hammy turn, which by no means, works. On the whole, 'Avengers: Age of Ultron' is very high on hype, but low on substance.",Avengers: Age of Ultron,2395427
24,moviexclusive,"In character and theme much darker and more complex a sequel than its predecessor, Joss Whedon creates yet another immensely satisfying Avengers chapter",7/10,22 April 2015,"If the first 'Avengers' movie was about building the team, then this one is about tearing them apart.If you've read the books, you'll know that Ultron's foremost purpose is to put the Avengers in the ground â€“ which in writer-director Joss Whedon's interpretation, becomes a symbol of grand irony. After all, Ultron was Tony's idea of creating an artificial intelligence which could protect mankind and so make the Avengers obsolete, a project which he happened to be working in secret with Bruce and his personal A.I. assistant Jarvis (voiced by Paul Bettany). Unfortunately for him, Ultron has taken the obsoletion of the Avengers quite literally, and determined for himself that the only way for mankind to survive is for it to be annihilated and thereby given a chance to evolve.That the Avengers will face Ultron and his army of replicas is a given, but what truly surprises is the twisty character-driven narrative which Whedon weaves to get to that jaw-dropping finale. You would already have heard of the high-profile additions Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), a pair of tightly-knit Eastern European siblings whose powers of speed and mind control respectively lend their reference here as ""enhancements"" â€“ and besides Ultron, the brother-and-sister pair become the most formidable threat to the Avengers, in particular the latter's psychic powers which she uses on Captain America, Black Widow and Thor to trigger memories of their past and face their personal demons. While their visions leave them distracted and unsettled, the rest of the team are also forced to confront their own fears. Tony's hubris, once the driving force of his pioneering spirit, could very well be the end of the Avengers and the destruction of everything he's tried to build. Bruce loathes his alter-ego, but recognises that his powers are still a valuable addition to the team, especially in protecting Black Widow, with whom he shares a deepening romantic interest hinted at in the last movie. And freed from the shackles of Loki's spell, Hawkeye is reminded of his mortality as one with no special powers or metal suit other than being an excellent archer, beautifully portrayed in a sojourn at the halfway mark that he makes to his 'safe house' to visit his wife and kids along with the rest of his teammates to recuperate and re-group.It is no small feat juggling so many characters in the same movie, and yet again, Whedon has pulled it off stunningly. Even though each is part of a larger team, no one fades into it; instead, Whedon lets us get to know each and every one of the Avengers intimately, so much so that you won't feel that you know them any less than you would if they each had their own standalone movie. And out of that character emphasis comes some lovely human moments that make this more soulful and poignant than its predecessor â€“ how Black Widow coaxes the Hulk back into human form, that Hawkeye is an All- American family man when not on superhero duty, why Ultron is really Tony's darkest side in the flesh (or metal) gone amok, and fundamentally the burdens that each one of our superheroes carry as a consequence of their powers.Besides Ultron, Whedon refuses to define any of the characters as ""good"" or ""bad""; rather, he identifies and illustrates their drives and impulses â€“ whether is it Tony's phobia or Captain America's old- fashioned sense of duty or even Ultron's Oedipal grudge â€“ and uses that to propel the story forward. This is ultimately how the team falls apart, going from the joviality of Thor's favourite party trick (otherwise known as ""who is fit to lift the hammer"") at the start to the infighting later on over Tony's plan to create yet another superior A.I. to defeat Ultron â€“ which ends up in the birth of the red-faced android named Vision (Bettany in the flesh). It is also how Whedon plots the reconciliation of the Avengers with their apparent arch-nemeses Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch, no doubt laying the foundation for the next phase of the Avengers programme â€“ and the next two-parter instalment due three years later.Only when it comes to matching the sheer jaw-dropping spectacle of its predecessor does this sequel become a victim of its own success. Despite hopscotching across the globe from Europe to Africa to Asia and back (culminating in the fictional East European country of Sokovia where it started), Whedon never quite achieves the same feeling of 'wow' that we had watching Loki take out S.H.I.E.L.D's airborne headquarters or unleash hell from the sky onto New York City. Whedon manage to replicate that feeling of astoundment in the much- anticipated Hulk-versus-Hulkbuster sequence, but the next to follow set in and around downtown Seoul is a major disappointment for blurry CGI and bad continuity. And though he tries to replicate the exhilaration watching the whole Avengers fighting together as an entire team, Whedon doesn't quite get our hearts leaping during the final standoff against hordes of replica Ultrons. If the finale lacks the emotional payoff of the first movie, that's also because Whedon had set himself up with a near impossible task in the first place. That probably explains why the 'Age of Ultron' is at its core a very different movie from the first 'Avengers', not just because of how our superheroes evolve in the face of imminent destruction precipitated by one of their own but also because of the complex psychological themes that Whedon explores here. His ambition is certainly admirable, but it is inevitable that those looking for the same straightforward thrills as its predecessor will be at least slightly disappointed. That said, this is still an outstanding feat by any measure, a riveting blend of intimate character moments and grand action spectacle that remains quite simply, Marvel-lous.",Avengers: Age of Ultron,2395427
25,FlashCallahan,"He's fast, she's weird.....",4/10,25 April 2015,"We find the team dealing with a threat of their own making..... a sentient robot called Ultron, who was originally designed as a peacekeeping program. Since Loki was captured, the team have been working to take down various cells of a secret society of villains known as HYDRA. Their aim to make the world a better, safer place inspires Tony Stark to create Ultron, in order to respond to additional threats that the Avengers aren't able to handle. Ultron, unfortunately, takes this directive way too seriously and believes that world peace can only be achieved by exterminating humanity, and he'll stop at nothing to accomplish this goal. The battle between the Avengers and Ultron is further complicated by the appearance of superpowered twin Quicksilver, and Scarlet Witch, who ally themselves with the homicidal android........It was always going to be a tough call to match the first Avengers movie, which, in all fairness, was a monumental cinematic experience, but here, it appears that Whedon knew he couldn't match it, realise the film would make bucketloads anyway, and just hasn't bothered with many of the characters.Oh yes, they have all the same screen time, but it appears that the heroes with their own separate franchises, have been sidelined in order for the humanistic side of the film to work, and in turn, it achieves it somewhat, but there is too much exposition that bloats the movie, and makes it, at times, an almost unbearable ordeal, which takes some doing, considering the wealth of characters in the film.But the real problem with the film is its lack of urgency, and here Whedon isn't to blame, it's Disney/Marvel being greedy and boasting about the next phase of Marvel movies,so we know who is safe, so Ultrons mission seems a little too futile.Where the humour in the first film was refreshing and went with the characters psyche, here it suffers the same as Thor: The Dark World Did, just too forced and unbelievable. Gone is Starks Sarcasm, Cap's future fear, and the general banter.But it's still spectacular in places, the Hulkbuster Vs. Hulk battle is the highlight, bonkers and very funny, Spader channels Downey Jr. As Ultron, Frankensteins Monster to Starks Victor, and he is a perfect choice.But the highlight of the film is Remmer, he really outshines the rest of the cast, the. It's human character in the film, and it's genuinely touching when he's with his family,showing a very vulnerable side to the Avengers.Olsen is the best out of the newcomers, Johnson is okay, but his 'I bet you didn't see that coming' grates toward the end.So all in all, it's a crushing disappointment for such an impressive franchise, major characters are sidelined, Jackson shows up like Schwarzennegar in the avengers, and friends pop up for no good reason from other Marvel movies.It feels like one long build up for Civil War, which does sound impressive.But then again this sounded wonderful.Meh-vengers, if you would.....",Avengers: Age of Ultron,2395427
26,charzhino,Grossly underwhelming (spoiler free),6/10,25 April 2015,"Spoiler free review. Let me first start of by saying that I am not a Marvel ''fanboy'' or a DC nerd. The comic book genre of films have made it to my personal top 3 favourite genres in the last decade and the MCU has been a strong contributor to that rise. I hold the first Ironman, first Avengers and Captain America 1+2 in high regard. I did not like the direction they took with Iron Man 3 (more on this below) or Guardians of the Galaxy but Winter Soldier was a gem in terms of balancing solid action, drama and levity.That being said, my initial thoughts on Age of Ultron (AoU) are quite negative. To me, its essentially a carbon copy of IM3. There are problems which strike you repeatedly as you progress throughout the film. The 2 biggest complaints I have with AoU is 1) the tone (comedy) 2) the script/writing.So starting with the tone. I like to laugh as I'm sure most people do, but there is a time and place to exhibit your comedy writing skills in an action film. In AoU, its a constant, recurring and predictable theme. It's not limited to one character either, everyone is popping one liner jokes as if its the Expendables and yes, most are not funny. The timing of these moments of levity are horrible too, desensitising the viewer to any impending fear of death in battle. If the characters seem so relaxed in not worrying about possibly dying, then what suspense is needed to be held by the audience? This plagued IM3 in a bad way and its arguably worse here. The comic book films which achieved great success in this regard were XMen DOFP, The Avengers 1, Cap 2 even Dark Knight Rises! Can you imagine at the climax of Xmen DOFP if old Magneto and Storm and Bishop start pulling one liner jokes as the army of sentinels came charging at them? It would kill any tension! 2) The script. I won't say too much since this is a spoiler free review, but it really feels rushed and unorganised. I watched Fast 7 around 2 weeks before AoU and I got similar vibes. Again, its not the fact that the film is 2.5 hours long or has too many characters, that isn't am excuse since The Dark Knight and Xmen DOFP shows how to navigate these theatrical obstacles. There are a few completely unnecessary subplots in AoU and useless characters which do not impact the story overall. The villain himself, Ultron is another massive let-down in Marvels already growing catalogue of mishandled villains.So as a summary, if you want mindless action and cool CGI, which this film does offer in the form of some spectacular visual fight scenes then you will like AoU. If you are after a darker, grounded and more moving story like the trailers promised, you will be severely disappointed. Final score 6/10 and I am being kind since Cap is my fav Avenger and they finally gave him some good screen time.",Avengers: Age of Ultron,2395427
27,prospectus_capricornium,"Explosive and Visually Extravagant, Yet Also Profound",9/10,22 April 2015,"Given how teeming with multiple awkwardly-diverse characters the AVENGERS franchise is, you can imagine how difficult and mentally-exhausting it is to gather all these uniquely vivid plot lines, with all their interspersing expositories and asides, and still be able to form one coherent and fluidly-constructed narrative. The first Avengers movie proved itself able to carry the weight of such challenge, and came out successful in delivering one the most poignant superheroic tales ever told. This year, AGE of ULTRON blasts into cinemas carrying the load of mammoth anticipation. While it is expected to perform betterâ€”if not as well as the previous releaseâ€”it will not be totally surprising, and will still be forgivable, if it falls just a feet beneath the staggering anticipation. Well, you can thank Joss Whedon for helming this projec. This movie soars past expectations.In AGE OF ULTRON, as the characters further expand, new names join the team, proving how much more difficult it must be for the screenwriters to still cling to their material's soundness, and make that further engaging and compelling. Nevertheless, Whedon and his prolific team of scriptwriters, come out triumphant over these apparent hurdles, managing again to weave all the heroes' divergent story lines and confine them together into one solid plot. Whedon effectively mines the capacities of these individuals and turns them into the very foundation of his epic superhero saga.Robert Downey's Iron Man/Tony Stark remains as a formidable figurehead in spite of his ever cynical and highly confident posture, while Chris Evans provides a dependable alternative with Captain America's leadership. There's an implicit undertone playing beneath the trajectory of these two leaders' relationship, and that might serve as an indirect catalyst to what is set to unfold in Captain America: Civil War. Chris Hemsworth's guileless 'Thor' is ever militant, yet innocent. This movie also draws more of the previous installment's less-utilized characters, into the scopes of its spotlight. Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye, enjoys his expanded character whose interaction with other avengers, has immensely improved, and he also has some of the best jaw-dropping action sequences here. Mark Ruffalo as Hulk still smashes, he's as diffident as he is dangerous, and yet still charmingly funny. Scarlett Johanson's character, Black Widow, has been treated with bigger attention, and her presence is never less if not as strong as her male counterparts. To forget the newcomers, Taylor Johnson's Quicksilver and Elizabeth Olsen's Scarlet Witch, is totally unfair too, as these two cemented their fiery presence right at the very first battle sequence of the movie. Same can be said with Paul Bettany's Vision, whose mysterious power might be the very weapon that could propel the Avengers to winning their battle against their biggest enemy: ULTRON. James Spader's voice strikes as the perfect embodiment of the indomitable android ULTRON who is hellbent to rendering the planet to extinction. Spader has the utmost command of the character and has fueled it with utter rage and bitterness, and calm and ease when needed. You're not going to forget Sam Jackson's Nick Fury too, and the rest of his team, including Falcon. He's as effectively leading his team here when he is needed to be as he was, the first time Avengers were called to assemble. It features Andy Serkis' entry to the franchise too, and while it's brief, he manages to established a commanding presence in the movie. The film grants everybody the right amount of exposure to shine, letting both their inner fragilities and physical prowess speak volumes for who they are. Their imperfections claim pivotal share in their greatest undertakingâ€”winning their very own internal battles so they could emerge able to save the world from the wrecking weights of annihilation.Straightaway at the beginning, Age of Ultron throws our heroes into roaring action, drawing us immediately into a surfeit of explosive and visually-omnipotent action extravaganzas that allow every smashing, pounding, flash of beams, flight, and basically everything, assume near-impossible forms of eye-squashing spectacles. It is when all these heroes engage together in combat against their enemies, that the movie subjugates all those hungry eyes, and grasps total domination over the audience's attention, letting the awestruck reception hum along the visual drama as it extends its reach beyond imagination. It is also when all the death-defying sequences and breathtakingly choreographed action set-pieces, spin out to full throttle, that the underlying cause why this band of superheroes fight with their lives, becomes blindingly evidentâ€”humanity. This is what had put them into this circle, in the first place, and it's what they are now aiming to preserve even when they have to wrestle with death. Whedon has never deprived these characters of humanity, making each of them similar, albeit their much readily-perceived differences. This summons affection for these characters, which right away the film gathers, whenever it puts the narrative's soul into the spotlight.AVENGERS: Age of Ultron is without fault, but too few and little that they're not even worth-noting. To be able to gather all these radical personas and bring their different worlds into one concrete universe, is already a colossal feat. Whedon proves to be capable of pushing the limits of the movie's accomplishments past that milestone, and the result is never less than monumental. The whole experience imparts an overwhelming sense of satisfaction, yet it also makes the audience hunger for more. Well, the movie lays ground-works and unleashes potential backdoors for the franchise's next chapters, and that makes everything that follows something to look forward to.AVENGERS: AGE of ULTRON is visually enthralling as it is emotionally profound, a cinematic achievement soaring above the previously reached heights in the ever expanding universe of superhero movies. 9/10",Avengers: Age of Ultron,2395427
28,preppy-3,Age of Ultron? More like Age of BOREDOM!,5/10,13 May 2015,"Bad sequel to the fantastic 2012 ""The Avengers"". Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) and Bruce Banner/Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) attempt to jumpstart a system to keep peace all over the Earth. Things go wrong and they create a being called Ultron (voiced by James Spader) who sets out to destroy all humans. It's up to the Avengers to stop them but he's helped by the Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olson) and Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson).This sequel is just terrible. The script is kind of vague in specifics about why Ultron hates humans and the Avengers so much. Also the dialogue here is TERRIBLE! No actor could put over the lines these people are given. So, understandably, almost all the acting is bad. Only Scarlett Johansson (as Black Widow), Mark Ruffalo and Jeremy Renner (as Hawkeye) give good performances. Worst of all the three new superheroes--Scarlet Witch, Quicksilver and The Vision--are very badly introduced and poorly used. Also the movie is far too long at almost 150 minutes and is more boring than exciting. Yes the special effects are flawless and there are a few very exciting and long action sequences but they can't save the movie. At the end the movie takes a disastrous turn and turns in a Transformers like movie! Boring and pointless with bad acting and dialogue. I give it a 5 for the effects and action.",Avengers: Age of Ultron,2395427
29,Ramascreen,The road to hell is paved with good intentions,10/10,22 April 2015,"AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON is simply amazingWhen it comes to superhero movies such as this, I always try to look beyond whether or not the adaptation is faithful to the material, because the audiences who'll be watching this movie aren't just comic book nerds, but also some of us who may have been a late bloomer or may have been only fans of just the movies, or still would have to wikipedia things to catch up. And I'm glad that writer/director Joss Whedon has that ability to make his ""Avengers"" movies engaging and inclusive, like an open door inviting everyone to come in instead of saying 'Well, if you don't know what's up, then tough luck.' If you've seen 2012's blockbuster, ""The Avengers"" which showed the rough start of how these individuals tried to work together as a team, well, you'll be glad to know that in the opening sequence of ""Avengers: Age Of Ultron"" we see them working in harmony as a team, they have a clear plan, everybody's got their job and everybody knows what they're supposed to be doing, Cap is leading, they all have each other's back, the whole sequence is like a well-oiled machine. But because of that, Whedon knows that he has to throw a curve ball, these ""Avengers"" movies are about teamwork, and so as a coach, Whedon has to throw in some kind of challenge that would make or break this team, to see if they could grow through obstacles and at first those obstacles come in the form of the twins: Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) who had a rough background, a rough upbringing, they're motivated by spite and distrust towards others, which is why when Ultron comes along, they share something in common or so they think.In the comics, Ultron, as I understand it, was created by Hank Pym, but in Marvel Cinematic Universe, in this movie, Ultron is created by Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) Do you remember the old saying ""The road to hell is paved with good intentions,"" that's the theme that Whedon is going with for this sequel. In the name of peace, Stark and Banner create an artificial intelligence that they hope would help them protect earth from any impending threat. But this A.I. blames humanity for everything, for not being able to reach such targeted peace. Refusing to be Stark's puppet, Ultron manufactures himself, regenerates himself, in other words clones himself into an army of killer robots. In ""Avengers: Age Of Ultron,"" you'll also get to see tension rising between Cap and Stark, at one point it got so bad, you're like ""Whoah, Whedon, save some for the Russos and their 'Civil War' movie, will ya"" but it all boils down to that teamwork again. Taking it upon yourself because you think it's for the greater good VS. talking it out as a team and respecting the collective decision.The movie is way bigger than the first one, not just in terms of scope or locations, because it's more than just one major city in the United States, it has gone global now, and you can just feel it that the battlegrounds would only go even more colossal from this point on, it expands from one place to a few different places and it's eventually going to be about the whole planet and even outer space, I just can't wait for how much more epic it's going to be in ""Avengers: Infinity War"" movies. But ""Avengers: Age Of Ultron"" is also bigger in terms of the cast. Whedon had a daunting task of making sure that each of the characters has their moment in the sun. The film's runtime is no longer than 2012's ""The Avengers"" but I think fans will be divided on how they would receive some of the ways Whedon explored the characters in this sequel. The romance between Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Cap vs. Stark, Ultron Vs. Stark, The Vision (Paul Bettany) trying to prove himself worthy of being part of the good guys, the twins and their dilemma, some fans might try to analyze which of those subplots seems forced or balanced and some fans may favor one over the other. But I think fans will be happy to see that Clint Barton/Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) gets more story this time around. And I think fans can agree that James Spader as Ultron could not be a more perfect choice. Obviously, this is not the first movie in the history of cinema to introduce a killer robot, but Spader infuses his charisma, his commanding voice, he's so articulate, he can persuade, influence, and convince you, this Ultron makes such a strong case, a strong argument, you can't help but somewhat agree with him to a certain level and I don't think anybody other than Spader could've better delivered that.Is ""Avengers: Age Of Ultron"" as equally spectacular as 2012's ""The Avengers?"" Not quite, but it's still an amazing feat nonetheless. It's got outstanding VFX, really cool cinematic set pieces and awesome cinematography that make this team look and move seamlessly like a work of art. It's a great blend of visual and story. It's action-packed and it's fun. The tone is way darker than the first movie but it's still got tons of that Whedon's sense of humor. If you're invested in the comic books, or if you're invested in only the previous Marvel movies leading up to this, you will all get catered to. ""Avengers: Age Of Ultron"" is one of this summer's most anticipated movies and it lives up to it.Please read more at Ramascreen.Com",Avengers: Age of Ultron,2395427
30,griffolyon12,"Movie Review: ""Avengers: Age of Ultron""",9/10,30 April 2015,"Lightning rarely strikes twice and that is the first thing you've got to understand about Avengers: Age of Ultron. The Avengers was one of those one of a kind movie-going experiences, and while I don't think Age of Ultron ever tops its predecessor, it is a really awesome movie in its own right. Filled with wall-to-wall action and more probing character exploration, Age of Ultron is what Serenity was to Firefly (pardon the Joss Whedon comparisons, but the guy did write and direct all of the aforementioned films and TV series). Age of Ultron is darker and more serious-minded than The Avengers, and yet there are enough one-liners and awesome comic book panel-worthy moments of mayhem that keep the film entertaining and a fitting kick-off to the Summer of 2015.In Age of Ultron, Tony Stark creates an artificial intelligence known as Ultron in hopes of being able to establish a peacekeeper for Earth that would make the Avengers obsolete. Of course, as with just about everything Tony Stark seems to touch, things go awry and Ultron takes possession of a series of robotic bodies and believes that the only way to true peace is through evolution, which means the demise of all human life on Earth, especially those pesky Avengers. What follows is this ragtag team that we saw come together in the first film falls apart and then has to rebuild themselves all while duking it out with Ultron and a pair of superpowered twins from Eastern Europe, Quiksilver and Scarlet Witch, who have allied themselves with Ultron.The greatest thing about Age of Ultron is it further cements the idea that these Marvel movies have really become like one really big TV series that you just have to wait every six months or so for each new episode. These things have very much become a machine with each entry being as impressively put together as the last, and when you couple that with the comfort of seeing characters you know and love reunited and bickering with one another, there is no way on Earth that you cannot enjoy the film.Seriously, if you are reading this, you're not really wanting a full lowdown because you are already going to see the movie regardless, so what do you really need to know? All you need to know is that Avengers: Age of Ultron is worthy of the Marvel brand. It is entertainment of the highest order with a story that manages to further challenge our heroes and force them to really decide where their priorities lie. While majority of the Marvel heroes did not want to become heroes, they did rise to the challenge when called because of a sense of responsibility, and the way Age of Ultron ends effectively answers the internal question that each of our heroes face. So what are you waiting for, get to the theater and see this movie as many times as you know you're going to see it.",Avengers: Age of Ultron,2395427
31,pinkled5,No one was more disappointed than me,5/10,1 May 2015,"It hurts to rate this so poorly, but it certainly deserves the low marks. There were so many things that ruined this movie for me.1) The Storytelling - Or lack thereof. There was not a compelling story to be told here. Ultron wants to blow up the world, the Avengers try to stop him. That's all the audience ever really knows about this story and it felt flat and unfulfilling.2) Plot? - The movie opens with our heroes in the middle of a battle for reasons that are largely unimportant. That pretty much sums up this whole film3) The Love Interest - Totally underdeveloped. We're basically told by the script writer that these two people are in love, but never are we SHOWN that they're falling in love. It rang completely hollow.4) The Humor - There were WAY too many jokes in this movie, and that wouldn't have been all that bad if so many of them weren't eye rollers. Many of them left me groaning.5) Ultron - This guy appears out of nowhere and is woefully underdeveloped. Plus, he's supposed to be some kind of AI but he's constantly cracking off stupid one-liners and making facial expressions that I thought were inconsistent with what and who he was supposed to be.6) Character Overload - There were WAY too many characters to do any of them any justice. I would have liked the film to focus on a smaller group of characters and their relationships with one another, instead, we got a who's who of the entire Marvel universe leaving a lot to be desired.I could go on, but my heart is still aching and I don't want to talk about it anymore. I see that a lot of people liked it and I'm happy that they did. I only wish it hadn't been such a colossal disappointment for me.",Avengers: Age of Ultron,2395427
32,Joejoesan,Even with high expectations it doesn't even disappoint!,8/10,20 April 2015,"Tony Stark wants to invent something that benefits mankind but instead turns out to be the one responsible for the creation of this dangerous self thinking robot, Ultron. The Avengers must assemble once again to fight this menace that wants to kill all the humans on this planet. But Ultron is powerful and the way he is presented makes you wonder how our heroes can defeat him. Just you wait and see...What I liked best about Age of Ultron was the fact that all our favorite heroes get equal screen time to show of what they can do. Although the action scenes are great (Iron Man in the Hulkbuster versus Hulk!) the thing that really makes this movie work is the interaction between all the people involved. Stark and Banner, Banner and Black Widow, Hawkeye and Black Widow, Thor and Captain America... like in real life you can see with whom each of them get along best. It's also nice to see that Hawkeye gets a lot of screen time. He even gets the most interesting background story of the bunch. Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch make a great addition to the team (sort of) and there are a lot more cameos in the movie (although I don't think anybody spotted Lou Ferrigno!).The movie runs about two and a half hours and that's pretty long. It could have been a little bit shorter, but overall I didn't mind. With great action scenes (pay attention to the opening action sequence in which he introduces the Avengers in one mighty shot!), nice humor, a lot of cameos and a satisfying finale writer/director Joss Whedon has everything under control and that pays of.This year (2015) The Avengers Age of Ultron will shatter all box office records and that will be a fitting reward for giving most Marvel fans and 'normal' moviegoers this big treat. Even Pixar slipped (with Cars 2 and Brave) so everybody's waiting for Marvel to produce a real stinker. Although that day may come, The Avengers part 2 is not the movie that will be responsible for that!8,5 / 10",Avengers: Age of Ultron,2395427
33,cultfilmfreaksdotcom,Age of Dulltron,1/10,1 May 2015,"In the first AVENGERS, the villain was Thor's personal albatross, and now Tony Stark's invention is out to save the world by destroying it, or something like thatÂ… And while it took over half the original movie for the eclectic group to warm up to each other, now we begin with so much bantering camaraderie it's like hanging out with the popular kids after promÂ… And there are about five jokes per minute, as if Robert Downey Jr's quick-witted sarcasm was infected onto everyone else â€“ even Ultron, Tony's dominating Artificial Intelligence Robot, who's full of wry wisdom: His nefarious motivation to do very bad things but unlike Loki, with an entire THOR film to catapult his dastardly menace, the titular heavy's purpose is completely forced and thoroughly confusing. Making the few good action sequencesÂ… like Hulk and Iron Man squaring offÂ… impressive eye candy that lacks any rhyme or reason.With such an immense fan base, it's pretty dangerous to not like THE AVENGERS. They are perfectly cast, and proved themselves a beyond-worthy franchise. The problem with AGE OF ULTRON is that the plot's as dull as the lame newcomersÂ… including a mind-reading witch girl giving everyone trippy hallucinations; a blond-haired Russian boy who runs really fast; and a red-faced crusader as strong as Thor, deleting the big guy's main asset. And with so much excruciating downtime this time around, you would think the gang was saving up their energyÂ… but for what, exactly? With all the jesting, where's the danger?

34,RevRonster,Another great chapter in the MCU!,10/10,2 May 2015,"I've been a loyal Marvel fan since I was a kid and the shared universe film series that began with ""Iron Man"" has pretty much become my drug of choice. I was very excited for ""Age of Ultron"" and the film did not disappoint me in any way.Joss Whedon does a tremendous job on this last Marvel film he created. He balances the large cast exceptionally well, develops all the characters perfectly, introduces new characters seamlessly, showcases a story that is bigger in scope and darker in tone but was still able to bring in great humor and tops it all off with great special effects and killer action.The only things I didn't dig was, occasionally, the action was muddled and hard to watch and Ultron takes a long time to really show off that he is a huge threat. However, these complaints did absolutely NOTHING to kill the fun I had watching it because the movie develops the universe so well and takes great strides in setting up set pieces that will come into play in the next phase of films.",Avengers: Age of Ultron,2395427
35,palavitsinis,This is why you pay the ticket!,10/10,7 May 2015,"Well, I watched it last night and I am still amazed and thinking about it! Truly one of the greatest marvel movies. I read some of the negative reviews from other users and I have to say that I don't understand them. Sometimes it feels like they paid a ticket to see a marvel movie, and then they expected some kind of Oscar winning performance and some deep and meaningful life-inspiring story. No. That's not it. If you expect that, look for another movie. For me, this kind of movies is like having single-flavor smoothies, like lemon or orange or strawberry, and then, one day a guy comes and says, ""do you want them all in one?"". That's actually it. Iron man, Thor, Hulk and Captain America, some very successful characters, all-in-one! What more can you ask for? I really liked the depiction of the different characters and how they all blended and interact with one another. It's really nice how each character keeps its own uniqueness and how they also blend together, creating some amazing moments. I really appreciated the humor of the movie which was really useful to break the tension in many points during the story. The Ultron was AMAZING as a villain as well as the Vision. The movie was packed with action and had an amazing flow that made you think you were already 1h30m into the movie, when it was actually only 45 minutes. Scenes that were too much even for such a movie were significantly less than the first movie. I really liked the way some parallel stories evolve and I was really happy to see in the end how the movie leaves room for another one.",Avengers: Age of Ultron,2395427

At the risk of over-hyping it any more, I can say it's probably the best Marvel movie to date. It manages to be action-packed, dramatic and even very funny in all the right places.After the Avengers lead a successful raid against a Hydra outpost, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) revives his secret peacekeeping program Ultron (voiced by James Spader) to help safeguard the planet from evil. However, Ultron interprets the idea of keeping Earth safe as a need to eradicate humankind from existence. Ultron shortly escapes from Stark's laboratory to act out its mission and it's up to the Avengers, along with their new allies, the twins Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) to stop Ultron from carrying out this genocidal act.Even though it is darker than the first film, Avengers: The Age of Ultron is still able to capture the charm and humour from its main characters that we have grown to love over the years. Tony Stark is still as witty as ever, delivering his trademark hilarious one-liners and Hawkeye's (Jeremy Renner) scenes have some of the most poignant moments in any Marvel film. But perhaps the biggest surprise were the twins Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch, who played a much more important role than I thought they would.

37,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Interesting Social Commentary Vailed in a Bigger Popcorn Movie than the First,7/10,4 March 2022,"This is a movie that I saw once in prep to go see another of the Avengers movies in the theater. Jaime and I watched this on our way to seeing Infinity War and Endgame as part of the Internet Movie Database poster we are working through.Where I want to start is that I didn't remember a lot about this movie. What works here is the villain of Ultron. In the beginning, our crew gets the staff that belonged to Loki. It is the one that Thanos gave to him. Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) gets the idea that they can use it to create an Artificial Intelligence named Ultron. He is helped by Bruce Banner/Hulk (Mark Ruffalo). The plan is to not need the Avengers by creating this. What happens is creating a being that wants to wipe out humanity after being on the internet.I'm shocked that I didn't remember more. This one is setting the stage for a lot of movies by referencing Wakanda, introducing Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and Vision (Paul Bettany). We are also getting interesting questions and answers that have been developed previously in Captain America movies. I've realized that when they're looking at more social issues, you have me on board.This is another fun one. It has some moments where it is too CGI heavy. There's not a lot you can do though. You have to continuously raise the stakes like we get here. Despite the huge cast, I think they balance it well. The movie is two and half hours so there is that. It does move at a good clip though for sure.My Rating: 7.5 out of 10.",Avengers: Age of Ultron,2395427
38,quincytheodore,"With myriad of stars and visual spectacle, Avengers: Age of Ultron is a pinnacle of excellence",9/10,22 April 2015,"Pick a single name from the cast list, and chances are that name is worthy of leading a movie on their own. Having so many talented actors reprising their roles and few a new additions to the assemble, the movie has no shortage of star power. Action is exhilarating, all forms of heroes and foes blasting colorful beams, throwing acrobatic punches and aerial acrobat. This film is as big as one would hope, and more.After a series of burdening battles, Tony Stark would try to use the power Avengers find to do some good, but his good intention doesn't produce equally good result. The premise is accessible, it doesn't try to overcomplicated thing, though what the film does best is how every character seems fitting in grand scheme of things. These strong individuals all have their own flaws and doubts, John Sheldon as director displays their struggles very aptly.Regardless of the superhuman attributes they possess, their problems and fears are identifiable to audiences. Script is well written, just as the dramatic plot moves smoothly, the humor is spot-on too. They all exchange banters and quips in expense of each other, even the bad puns manage to pry some smiles. Balancing between the gradually bleak premise and the rich characters' ordeals are done gracefully. There is no weak spot here, as everyone performs amazingly and everyone in audience would likely find something, someone they can relate with.Action is a hybrid between CG and choreography. Visual is astoundingly impressive. Fast and relentless, the mayhem is still delicately constrained for audience's viewing pleasure, so you'd know who is involved at the mauling on a particular scene. There are even a few snappy continuous shots for good measures. It is as grand as advertised, and better yet the dashing action sequences are shared harmoniously between the fancy characters.Avengers: Age of Ultron is an explosion made from collision of stars and spectacular graphic, and with such a blast it is poised to be the biggest explosion of the year.",Avengers: Age of Ultron,2395427
39,stephendaxter,"A fun, comedic and action packed film that lived up to all expectations",9/10,22 April 2015,"Avengers Age of Ultron was one of the biggest and most anticipated movies of the year and it did not disappoint. This movie was everything you want an avengers movie to be, a near perfect blend between Action, Comedy, and character development. I felt that they handled the large cast fairly well with each of the avengers getting a good amount of screen time. But it isn't just the individual characters that makes it so entertaining, it is the chemistry between the characters that works so well. All of the subplots and jokes that they carry throughout the film stay interesting and really elevate the film. The comedy is exactly what you expect from an avengers film, the back and forth jokes work to really lighten the mood and give it that Marvel film feel, even Ultron sneaks a few jokes in a couple of times.Now let's talk about the action, this film had plenty of action sequences from start to finish and they are just so fun and exciting and you are on the edge of your seat at all times. The way the film finds ways to capture all these characters fighting at the same time in a way so that you can see everything that happens is amazing. Ultron was definitely an awesome villain and maybe the strongest and best villain the Marvel universe has seen so far. He is so evil that when he is on screen you feel his presence and how intimidating he is. He really adds a lot to the plot and makes the film so much more entertaining in both the action scenes and plot driven scenes. Speaking of the plot, the subplots I thought all worked really well and the main plot for the most part was really interesting. I just thought that the first half of the film felt a little messy as it tried to setup Ultron and some other characters while trying to still include the characters we have known so far. The jumping between locations and all that could have been refined a little better, but they did what they had to do within the runtime. But that is the only issue I had with the film and a minor one at that. Everything else gelled together so well and created one of the best (and my favourite) movies of the year so far. If you love Marvel films and action films in general I believe you will love this fun, action packed film. - 9.5",Avengers: Age of Ultron,2395427
40,Anurag-Shetty,Exceeded my expectations in every way. The best superhero movie of all time!,10/10,24 April 2015,"Avengers: Age of Ultron continues with the story of the Avengers, who are Earth's mightiest heroes. The team consists of Tony Stark/Iron Man(Robert Downey Jr.), Thor(Chris Hemsworth), Bruce Banner/The Hulk(Mark Ruffalo), Steve Rogers/Captain America(Chris Evans), Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow(Scarlett Johansson) & Clint Barton/Hawkeye(Jeremy Renner). After the events of The Avengers(2012), Iron Man 3(2013), Thor: The Dark World(2013) & Captain America: The Winter Soldier(2014), the Avengers are hot on the trail of Loki's scepter which is in the hands of HYDRA. Due to all the attacks on Earth in recent times, Tony Stark believes that the world needs additional protection, other than the Avengers. He convinces Dr. Bruce Banner to help him build Ultron(James Spader), a sentient robot that can protect the Earth & help the Avengers to stop any global threat. However, things don't quite go as planned. Ultron has a warped perception of the world & the Avengers. He wants all the Avengers extinct & has diabolical plans for the Earth. Now, it is up to the Avengers to stop Ultron before it's too late. However, it won't be easy as Ultron has the help of twins with incredible powers. They are Pietro Maximoff/Quicksilver(Aaron Taylor-Johnson) who has the power of super speed & Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch(Elizabeth Olsen) who has the power of telekinesis & mind control. Avengers: Age of Ultron is an incredibly epic film! It surpasses its predecessor in every way possible! My expectations for this movie were through the roof. I kept thinking to myself, there's no way that it can surpass the highest grossing superhero movie of all time. I was wrong. Joss Whedon has outdone himself. He has truly made a bigger & better film. Sure, the formula is the same as the first movie but, everything is ten times better. Besides, only the basic idea remains the same. The climax of the movie is significantly different. The camaraderie among the Avengers has increased. There are plenty of memorable scenes with all of them together. Though this film is darker, the humor that all the Marvel movies are known for, is intact. There are plenty of witty one-liners that will make you guffaw from time to time. Plus, if you enjoyed the squabbling among the various Avengers in the first film, don't fret. There's plenty of that, this time around too. I loved the fact that our heroes travel the globe & are not just stuck in New York where almost all superhero movies take place. The special effects are otherworldly. Each action set-piece is more fantastic & thrilling than the last. Two of my most favorite sequences are the Hulk vs. the Hulkbuster showdown & the climax of the movie. The 3D is eye-popping & has been put to good use throughout the film. This movie wouldn't be half as incredible without the superb performances from the stellar cast. Robert Downey Jr. is spectacular as Tony Stark/Iron Man. After so many portrayals of this character, Downey Jr.'s performance seems effortless. Chris Hemsworth is awesome as Thor. Hemsworth balances the God of Thunder's wit & seriousness with ease. Mark Ruffalo is brilliant as Bruce Banner/The Hulk. Ruffalo's killing it as both the mild mannered scientist & the 'other guy'. The motion capture for the Hulk is extremely realistic. Chris Evans is outstanding as Steve Rogers/Captain America. Evans keeps getting better & better with each portrayal of America's first superhero. Scarlett Johansson is amazing as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow. Johansson portrays a more vulnerable Nat, this time around. Jeremy Renner is great as Clint Barton/Hawkeye. I loved that Renner's character is given more importance in this sequel. Aaron Taylor-Johnson & Elizabeth Olsen are super as Pietro Maximoff/Quicksilver & Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch. The Maximoff twins are a welcome addition to the Avengers universe. Paul Bettany is excellent & unrecognizable as Jarvis/Vision. James Spader is the perfect combination of intimidating, powerful, terrifying & funny as Ultron. All the ingredients that make the ideal villain. Spader's deep baritone & trademark drawl are perfect for the voice of Ultron. Cobie Smulders is impressive as Maria Hill. Samuel L. Jackson is perfect as Nick Fury. Many key players in the Marvel Cinematic Universe have cameos. They are good too. Joss Whedon & the entire cast & crew of Avengers: Age of Ultron, take a bow. Avengers: Age of Ultron is a masterpiece. Go for it now!",Avengers: Age of Ultron,2395427

42,TheLittleSongbird,"Not as good as the first film, still a solid sequel",7/10,6 June 2016,"No matter how much 'Avengers'/Marvel detractors go out of their way to suggest that those who legitimately like the 'Avengers' films and Marvel's output are wrong and invent ridiculous conspiracy theories without proof, this reviewer loved 'Avengers Assemble' while acknowledging that it wasn't perfect.'Avengers: Age of Ultron' is a solid sequel, though not as good as 'Assemble' and not without its flaws. There are a few longueurs in the pacing, as a result of a few overlong scenes that don't go very far (as admirable as it was to do more with Hawkeye's character, the farm scene did grind the film to a halt somewhat), parts that were not as developed as one would have liked or didn't add much to the film and some of the many characters are more interesting than others.While one does admire that more was attempted to be done with Hawkeye, he still felt underwritten and not always necessary. Ultron, despite a cool appearance and chilling voice work from James Spader, is an underdeveloped, not very interesting and one-dimensional villain and doesn't pose enough of a threat. And while most of the comedy is funny and witty, there are moments that jar too much when the scene is serious or intense and it spoils the mood.However, 'Avengers: Age of Ultron' looks fantastic, very slickly shot and edited with sumptuous and atmospheric set and costume design and quite spectacular special effects. The music avoids being overbearing or over-bombastic, as well as avoiding being too quirky or one-note. Joss Whedon ensures that the fun and tension rarely slips and that a good deal of the characterisation is interesting, visually and stylistically there is nothing to fault here.Furthermore, the film is wittily, cleverly and intelligently scripted with a good deal of the tonal shifts handled well with only some jarring humour disappointing. While not perfect in execution, the story is absorbing, there are plenty of fun moments, thrillingly choreographed and executed action scenes (especially the earth-shattering climax) and while it could have been developed a little more and could have been less forced when introduced Hulk and Black Widow's relationship is given admirably sensitive treatment here.The film's characters are mostly interesting and engaging, not complex but that wasn't expected. The acting is impeccable, Robert Downey Jnr, Chris Hemsworth and Chris Evans really excel in roles tailor made for them, while Scarlett Johansson gives a fearless intensity to Black Widow and Mark Ruffalo is by far the best and most layered live-action Hulk. As said, James Spader is chilling as the voice of Ultron, and one does wish that more was done with the character, Paul Bettany and Samuel L. Jackson are great value and Aaron Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen play the newcomer roles with plenty of fire. Jeremy Renner does what he can.Overall, a solid sequel if not as good as 'Avengers Assemble'. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Avengers: Age of Ultron,2395427

44,kaianmattmckay,Somewhat disappointed,5/10,13 February 2017,"I'm a big fan of Marvel and have seen the other Avengers titles, and so I went into this one with certain expectations. They weren't met.As opposed to earlier installments, barely a few minutes seem to pass in AoU without one of the characters making what is supposed to be an amusing, throwaway remark/one-liner. There's nothing wrong with injecting a little levity into the proceedings, but in this case, I found it excessive, and detrimental both to the flow of action and to the characters and how you engage. Wisecracking is usually one character's responsibility, specifically to provide comic relief. When all the characters are doing it, it gets tired very quickly.I found the plot to be a bit messy, perhaps because I'm a comics purist, and the introduction and treatment of several new characters here is only tangentially related, if even that, to their actual origin stories as per the comics. With apologies to James Spader, I found the portrayal of Ultron in particular to be bordering on the ridiculous, and inappropriately ""human"", as in my imaginings, Ultron was always more of a Terminator-style killing machine with tyrannical tendencies, whereas we're presented here with more of a lovable but psychotic rogue with as much dangerous charm as he has nuts and bolts. The whole effort seems to be held together by an abundance of action, new characters, and cameos from previous characters (Samuel L. Jackson, or Idris Elba) to distract from the general lack of substance.All in all, it was 2+ hours that I don't totally regret spending, but would not see it again, or recommend it - unless it's just for the voyeuristic pleasure of seeing your favourite eye-candy protagonists in biker leathers and latex.",Avengers: Age of Ultron,2395427
45,ironhorse_iv,This uncanny movie directed by Joss Whedon is still pretty marvelous.,8/10,29 April 2015,"When the Walt Disney Company purchase Marvel Studios in 2009; there was lots of doubts that story of the Avengers comics book, could ever be put on screen, and make sense to non-comic book readers. Marvel Studios, somehow pull it off, with the Phase One film campaign. From 2008 to 2012, the first set of movies introduces the core main characters of the Avengers superhero group, such as Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), and Captain America (Chris Evans), one by one. All this work in creating a Marvel Cinematic Universe, leaded to 2012's megahit, The Avengers, which compare all these characters into one film. Once again, Marvel Studios is trying to recapture the magic, by launching Phrase 2, which focuses on even more new characters, while exploiting the establish characters in solo missions type films. Most of those films, kinda work, as they help push the Infinity Stones storyline even more, while showing the breakdown of establish agency groups, such as S.H.I.E.L.D. When Marvel Studios once again, wanted to bring back Avengers, back together, it brought all types of sub-plot storyline back into one film. Sadly, in my opinion, Avengers 2: Age of Ultron doesn't really connect that well, with the other previous solo films. The film left a lot of the previous films plot-holes, unexplained and continue to make it, wider, with even more confusing, rush subplots. It kinda felt, like the movie was repeating itself, more than often. While, the movie does bring new light into the main characters dark gritty back stories, the main plot is pretty generic. Instead, of aliens trying to destroy the world, it is robots leaded by Ultron (Voiced by James Spader). The whole idea of the Avengers bringing Vision (Paul Bettany) to life, to protect the world, comes out of nowhere and seem kinda forced. Also, I didn't like how the Vision look. He look kinda stupid due to the costume changes. He looks a robot made out of Starbursts. Other than that, visually, this movie directed by Joss Weldon is amazing to watch. It had tons of great action pack scenes, but the writing would need, some work. The ""story telling"" in this movie is practically non-existent. The movie is nothing more than a giant action sequence sprinkled with what passes as dialogue in between. The humor was alright for the most part. The acting, throughout the film is pretty good. It was a bit weird, seeing Tony Stark in the Iron Man suit, because he destroy most of his technology in the end of 2013's Iron Man 3. Robert Downey Jr is indeed Iron Man. It would be, hard to replace him. I really hope, they will be able to keep, Downey aboard, until 2019's Avengers Infinity Wars are over. Chris Evans is everybody favorite Boy Scout, and he continues to make Captain America, seemed new. I love, how, the movie is settling up, the events between him and Stark, leading to 2016's Captain America: Civil War. It looks great. Chris Hemsworth as Thor, honed this part. I just didn't like his little sub mission. It didn't bring anything new to the table. I like, that Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) is given, more depth. The whole romantic subplot, of Bruce Banner AKA Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) & Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) seem odd. It was a mixed bag for me. I like, the whole Red Room exposition scene, but I really didn't buy, into Natasha having a thing for Banner, after having flings with both Captain America & Hawkeye in the previous films. Still, both of their acting is pretty well-done. The villains are pretty good. James Spader is amazing as Ultron. He has the right amount of wit and smarts, to play a convincing robotic megalomaniac. I really didn't like the changes, they did to the character origins, but I was willing to go with it. New characters like Elizabeth Olsen as the Scarlet Witch was really needed. She pretty own it. I really didn't mind, Aaron- Taylor-Johnson as Quicksilver, but it was kinda a disappointment. Evan Peters did a better job in 20th Century Fox's version of Quicksilver in 2014's X-Men: Day of Future Past. I really thought, that having Quicksilver in this Marvel Studios film, was very pointless, and I was somewhat right. I really had, no strong emotion ties with Aaron's version of character. Both Baron Strucker (Thomas Kretschmann) & Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) seem like a waste. I hate to see them as half-baked, side villains. Still, it's nice to see Andy Serkis, not in a motion-capture type role. Also, look forward to the Stan Lee's cameo. The ending action scene to the film was kinda disappointing due to how outlandish, it was. It was simply impossible for the sequel to recapture the magic of seeing Earth's Mightiest Heroes assembled on screen for the first time, especially when they've popped up in each others' movies in the ensuing years and the overuse of trailers spoiling way too much of the film. Still, as far as second installments go- it was alright. It was good popcorn fun. It's a solid and entertaining follow-up. The post-credits scene wasn't anything, worthy to wait for. The music was kinda underwhelming. Wish, the music had the same tone of the first film. Overall: The film was OK. It easily fulfilled and the exceeded most of my expectations. It's time to assemble again and go see this movie. You wouldn't regret it! I do recommended, seeing this sequel.",Avengers: Age of Ultron,2395427
46,BoilerYor,Even Worse Than The First One,2/10,4 September 2021,"All sorts of trash gets rated above 7 on here.Two and a half hours of characters quipping, undermining any sense of tension or threat. Then again, when the main villain is also a wisecracker, it kind of fits.Joss Whedon is a visually illiterate director and the most overrated screenwriter working in Hollywood. The endless and relentless quips do not a good dialogue make. He should've practiced directing between 2012 and 2014. Maybe he could have delivered, at least a competently made movie.Whedon should stick to TV. It's clearly where he belongs.

47,jay-techie2007,A spectacle to watch!!,10/10,26 April 2015,"With a mountain of expectations this movie went to the floors and pulled off something very few movies are able to. In fact, IMHO, none of the movies so far, has done it as brilliantly as Avengers AOU.One thing which I liked the most about the movie was that it involved a bit of story to every single thing happening and was narrated in beautiful as well as very convincing manner. Nothing was defying logic or didn't make sense. Although Hollywood writers have a very good hand at developing a convincing plot to their story, Avengers AOU took it to another level. Visually the movie scores more than 10 on 10. Some really great graphics work has been accomplished at Marvel Studios last year and early this year. You can see this in the 141 minute entertainer. The Scarlett Johansson bike scene distinctly reminds you of Carrie-Anne Moss Ducati chase of Matrix Reloaded. The acting has been beyond expectations and none of the actors disappoint, irrespective of the screen time they get. Like the earlier version, the movie is able to give justice to each and every super hero, be it in terms of importance given in the story or the screen time. As some of the leaked reports would have already told, the epic battle between Iron Man and Hulk is worth waiting for and is spectacular. At the end, ,just like Fast and Furious 6 left everyone waiting for FF7, Avengers - AOU keeps you waiting for Avengers 3. Just hope it doesn't disappoint like FF7 did, because the standards set by AOU is very very high.",Avengers: Age of Ultron,2395427

More (or less) of the same in the gang's all back to take on another life-force hellbent on destroying mankind - this time Marvel's Universe unleashes the titular artificial intelligence Frankenstein (silkily oozingly voiced by a smug Spader with spare of charm) ala Tony Stark's attempt for a global safeguard with malevolence aplenty in the long run. While the team assembled fires on all cylinders - Downey's snark, Hemsworth's powerhouse Thor, Evans' square to be hip Cap'n America - check check check - the film falters in its being quagmired in sentiment between Bruce Banner and Natasha Romanoff and Clint Barton's familial wares totally wears down the come-on-already-we-get-now-get-to-the-collective-ass-kicking-already! Filmmaker Joss Whedon returns - reportedly for the final time - and while his smart screenplay runs as best as anticipated for rock 'em-sock'em and slash/burn comedy it runs on its last act with just enough oomph for a possible re-entry for the franchise.

49,dvo_on,Felt so bland,3/10,23 April 2015,"Everything seems so bland. The constant jibe of who gets the last word in seems forced, predictable and acts like an edit for the next scene. Coming out of the screening, there is not one scene or moment that i feel that i can walk away with in awe.The romantic angle that was introduced lack chemistry. From out of nowhere, the characters involved suddenly had an interest for one another? Without any build up of it in past movies nor in this one, it just felt empty.Camera angles that were purposefully shot for the intentional thrill of 3D is like any other angles used in any other 3D-movie-going-experience. I wonder when will this gimmick/trend go away.All in all...it is still watchable. It just left a disdain taste of yet another repetition of the Marvel formula.

50,bkoganbing,That spirit of fun,6/10,29 June 2015,"If there were not an audience for Marvel comic heroes than clearly these films would not be made, to answer one other reviewer although I sympathize with him somewhat. The world is indeed an infinitely more complex place than the world of Marvel comics with clearly identifiable heroes and villains. But I get the feeling that from Robert Downey, Jr. on down the organizer and prime mover as Iron Man behind the Avengers these players do love doing these roles because it's a lot of fun. If they didn't show that spirit of fun to the audience than these films would never be made.So in that spirit of fun Avengers: Age Of Ultron comes before us and everyone looks like they're having a good time saving the world. A computer program got loose and took form in this dimension named Ultron and James Spader who is completely unrecognizable is running amuck in the earth. No doubt Star Trek fans took notice that this guy's mission is to cleanse the earth much like that old earth probe NOMAD which got its programming mixed up in that classic Star Trek prime story. Wouldst Captain James T. Kirk of the Enterprise had a crew like Downey has at his command.My favorite is always Chris Evans because of the whole cast he best gets into the spirit of being a superhero. Of all of them, he's already played two superheroes, Captain America and Johnny Storm the Human Torch. I'll be before he's done Evans will play a couple of more as long as the money's good and he enjoys it.Pretend you're a kid again and enjoy, don't take it so seriously.",Avengers: Age of Ultron,2395427
51,Ziya90,The director couldn't catch the achievement of the first,1/10,20 March 2016,"The Avengers Age of Ultron starts out with a soulless and pointless action sequence and the rest of the movie is not much different than this part. Since we don't know our heroes fight for who and why, we don't get excited for the adventure that our heroes have. Then, somehow, the cinematography is lifeless, the technical craftsmanship accomplishment is boring. Everything is too mechanic here. The villain of the movie is an artificial intelligence, again ""mechanic"". Everything about this villain is so clichÃ© from his words to his evil plans to destroy the world, humanity, whatever. In the first movie, almost everything was perfect. This second installment is lack of heart and soul and an exciting adventure. The movie was like an empty roller coaster ride. The action and the fight scenes are uninspiring, lifeless. Everything happens just so quickly and it is overblown. Another thing the movie was lack of is the tension or clash between the allies. What makes the first movie spectacular was the sweet conflicts among the heroes. Returning to Ultron, it was not intimidating, not hilarious like Loki, honestly, it is just a machine! (Terminator fans, please don't be offended, this is a different case) In contrast with the promises by the director, this is not a darker movie. This is a boring action film. For example, adding romance into a movie doesn't make it deeper or sophisticated. Action is soulless and completely forgettable here except for two scenes. The first and the best is Hulk vs. Hulbuster scene which was fairly done. I have seen it dozens of times. The second one is the highway chase with Captain America and Black Widow, but it was like a copy of The Matrix Reloaded and nothing new. From the beginning, I don't like the appearance or the manners of this new Hulk (the first is favorite), but Hulk is OK here. The second half of the movie focuses on destruction like Man of Steel in a bad way. Do you want to hear Iron Man's witty comments? Thor's majesty? Captain America's work discipline? Hulk's anger? None of them is here. Loki? I miss him. Unfortunately, Quicksilver loses the game from the first minute, because we had seen a brilliant Quicksilver before. Scarlett Witch bewitched me, but I just couldn't get warm to her. I hope I will start to love her in future installments. Vision was completely unnecessary. Hulk is not like a gorilla or a fun mascot here which is good, but he is used like a pawn in this movie. Finally, Age of Ultron is sometimes dreadful, sometimes cheesy, sometimes dull, sometimes pretentious and mostly soulless sequel. I am very happy that the next adventures are going to be directed by Russo Brothers who gave us terrific ""The Winter Soldier"".",Avengers: Age of Ultron,2395427
52,anselmdaniel,A stepping stone,7/10,29 January 2023,"This review contains spoilers.Avengers: Age of Ultron is an ensemble superhero action movie directed by Joss Whedon. The movie introduces a new villain in Ultron and introduces new characters such as Wanta Maximoff and Pietro Maximoff.Avengers: Age of Ultron is an acceptable superhero action movie. The movie has many points it is trying to convey in the short running time of 141 minutes that it can feel rushed in some aspects and too brief in others. The movie starts with a battle at a Hydra base where Tony Stark retrieves Loki's scepter. This action scene is meant for exposition in the later parts of the movie. Avengers: Age of Ultron has two far reaching arcs that the movie juggles. The movie wants to set up Ultron and Vision whilst also setting up Wanda Maximoff. The movie wants to relate this to the infinity war saga overall. The movie handles all of these arcs to varying degrees of success.Ultron is not an intimidating or memorable villain. Ultron is a villain that should be a large part of the infinity war saga or the Marvel Cinematic Universe. However Ultron serves as a stepping stone in this movie. Ultron should have been a much more intimidating villain but as it stands, he is a villain that had big plans and large concepts but the writers did not give the villain a long enough runway for the ideas to coalesce. An Avengers movie features all of the heroes coming together, but this felt like a lighter solo movie.Avengers: Age of Ultron is the introduction of Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver as characters. The movie juggles this story and has to make these two characters not irredeemable. The movie is put into this corner with regards to both of these characters that the movie feels it has nothing to say about both of them. The movie straddles this line of having the pair thwart the Avengers but also having them restrained.The movie has a loose connection to the overall infinity war saga. The movie does not have a strong connection to the overall plot besides having usage of the infinity stones and introducing new characters.I would recommend ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" directed by Joss Whedon.Grade: C.",Avengers: Age of Ultron,2395427
53,TonightTurnYourWeaponsToSnow,Remember the amazing teaser trailer? Expect the opposite.,1/10,30 April 2015,"There's no one word that can some up this movie. I won't use 'eh' because that's a bit too vague, and I think it's a bit better than that. But things like 'good' or 'amazing' are too crazy to use. Welcome to my review.Age of Ultron opens to a fine start -in fact, an amazing start- with a fresh, intense, action-packed sequence. The Avengers are introduced for the sequel, and so are two new characters: Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver. These ended up being my favourite (Yes, I'm spelling it right. I'm not American, y'know) characters in this movie. Unfortunately, they get tossed a side a bit. Considering they're new characters, and considering one is in an upcoming movie and the other dies, they should have gotten more development. I adored Scarlet Witch and her powers, at least in the parts that she's ACTUALLY IN.After the opening, everything goes downhill, at least SLIGHTLY. Ultron's introduction is quite terrible. Can anyone explain to me how this invisible force can suddenly SPEAK inside a whole load of technological material? I don't know... It just felt pretty dumb to me. If this was how it was in the comics, then I suppose I can't really complain much. But I guess I could say that it doesn't translate to screen very well. After that, the movie becomes kind of dull. I kept twitching in my seat various different times. If I can say one thing, it's that the action sequences were fantastic, and they're the only things that hold this movie up. Ultron was nothing like he was in the teaser trailer that got me hyped, nor was the movie. I wanted a dark, gritty, intense, heart-breaking, half-horror movie! The advertising for this movie is false, almost to the point where I could sue. Remember Scarlet's gut-wrenching scream, or maybe Ultron saying ""There's no strings on me"" in the teaser trailer? Well guess what? Nowhere to be found. But there's one last thing that makes me feel at least a bit satisfied with the movie, and that was the last act. When Ultron's plans were finally revealed, everything turned amazing. The CGI effects were absolutely incredible, and there are shots in the trailers that would reveal his plan if they were extended by a few seconds, so keep an eye out...By the end of this review, I can finally figure out one word to sum this up. 'Overrated.'You can mark this review as unhelpful, but I don't care. It's my opinion. This movie is definitely NOT a must see, but I guess it is for any fans of the comics.Just be prepared for a completely different film to the film marketed in the trailers.. Thank you for reading, and I know that at least somebody will agree with me.EDIT:So I was sippy sipping on my mug of tea and I almost spat it out all over my screen. This movie is rated 7.9. I have now changed my 6/10 rating to 1/10 simply to try and lower the rating to what it deserves. Before you Marvel nerds attack me, I am doing this because this movie is average at most. You are crazy if you rate it higher than 6.Goodbye.",Avengers: Age of Ultron,2395427

Age Of Ultron is about when Tony Stark tries to make a robot called Ultron. It's meant to save the world but things go wrong and now they have to get every avenger and more people to stop Ultron. First off, Age Of Ultron was amazing and blew the first avengers out of the water. Everything was more fun, and raised the stakes to a whole another level. Now, there are some parts of the movie that felt not needed for this movie but you know that it will become a bigger piece in the MCU. What makes age of Ultron great as the first one is seeing all the avengers together. The old cast is great as before and with the addition of the new characters, it's just better. Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch were great additions to the MCU. The one person who stole the whole movie was Hawkeye. He had a lot more screen time and much more character development. Overall Avengers: Age Of Ultron was an amazing movie, much smarter and fun than any other marvel movie yet. A must watch In the theaters. Great start to the summer movies of 2015.

How is that even possible??",7/10,2 May 2015,"For those of us who were disappointed with this movie, and judging by most of the reviewers here (who are not fake), a lot of us were disappointed I was semi entertained but to me being marginally entertained is NOT good enough for a movie of this caliber that costs 1/4 of a billion dollars to make!I guess I expected more from this movie. The trailer made it seem like it was going to be a home run but this barely got to first base. This was more like the last transformers movie, mindless, stupid action that catered to 15 year olds. The script was bad, WAY TOO MANY one liners(most were not funny at all), way too many characters and not enough explanation, and that's just the start of it, I could go on and on. This was just an overall disappointment that certainly should not be a 8.0, not even close. Even most of the reviewers here that gave it a 8, 9, or 10 complained in their review about a lot of things. And they still gave it a very high score? Doesn't make sense, so I am doing the only thing I can which to to tell all my friends how horrible this movie was and never purchase the DVD.Sorry Marvel and Disney but you better start doing a whole lot better or you will not be getting any more money from me! The people have spoken, we expect better next time!!",Avengers: Age of Ultron,2395427

58,Spondonman,Not weird at all: It easily holds its own,8/10,20 December 2015,"Against the excellent previous Avengers film I mean. Seen this four times now over the last few months so it seems to be a film I enjoy for one reason or another. It definitely helps that when I was a kid I briefly got into superhero comic book adventures, then left it for other things but think I still understand the genreÂ…and even a few of the plots. Marvel will worry about alienating people who can't keep up, as they first started to in the '70's; but ultimately no one can keep up, including their scriptwriters. However, they're by far the best ones to do their stories.More or less superhuman Goodies vs Baddies led by a violent peacekeeper Ultron in a breathless bone crunching nail biting 2 hours, mixing mayhem and wise-cracking comedy effortlessly. It's pointless describing anything in more detail even if I understood it: the plot's deliberately barmy but engrossing, with cgi cartoonery used as it was always meant to be used - with many variations we've seen it all before and with many more variations being presently dreamed up expect to again and again. As with the first film there are many iconic comic booky scenes for posterising. Ultron cynically sings I've Got No Strings from Pinocchio occasionally, but the original Thunderbirds were just as realistic to me. Worthy of note is the almost Shakespearean scene on the train between baddie Ultron and Scarlet Witch after her brother's surprising demise.Highly enjoyable and recommended non-essential viewing by this non-expert non-purist, the running time whizzes by every time I see it. At this rate I may understand it all in about a year's time too. Do Marvel include Howard The Duck in their Cinematic Universe?",Avengers: Age of Ultron,2395427
59,chandean-69762,Avengers: Age of Ultron 2015 Review,8/10,16 February 2021,"This movie deserves more credit then it's given.
Coming off of the first Avengers film, sure this is a step down, but Age of Ultron is still full of solid action, good humor, and amazing superhero synergy.
Even with the new additions, Paul Bettanys Vision, Elizabeth Olsen's Wanda Maximoff, and James Spaders Ultron, this movie does an amazing job of meshing all these new characters in with the old.
Ultron in this movie felt like another Mandarin (Iron Man 3). But in my opinion, the change of character and James Spaders voice acting works amazingly for this character and makes him extremely memorable.My only complaint would be Aaron Taylor Johnson's Quicksilver, he's definitely nothing to write home about. His character is extremely lackluster and only used to serve a minor part of the plot at the end (not talking about the implications that come from WandaVision), and when compared to Evan Peters Quicksilver from the Fox X-Men movies: it's a major step down.

60,tavm,Avengers: Age of Ultron was another awesome epic from Marvel Studios!,9/10,5 May 2015,"Joss Whedon and Marvel Studios have done it again! That is, they made an awesome Avengers movie full of great action, good humor, and nice dramatics concerning characterization. Whedon, previously creator of such classic TV shows like Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, and Firefly, is such an expert of mixing genres that it's easy to take him for granted now but he still has some surprises in how he still puts it all together. Like the fate of one of the superhero characters, for instance. It's so awesome seeing Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Hawkeye, The Hulk, and the Black Widow fighting side-by-side once again saving the world! Oh, and yes, Stan Lee does another of his awesome cameos saying something he's famous for this time! So on that note, I definitely recommend Avengers: Age of Ultron!

61,Aaron1375,"I enjoyed it, but it felt underwhelming this time around",8/10,4 May 2015,"I enjoyed watching this film, but I have to say the first one was better. That is to be expected I guess, as it was the first time something of that scope had been attempted and all the lead up to the film with the other films. This one, just kind of felt almost episodic rather than being an epic film. Basically, as if it was a television series rather than a full length feature film I paid money to see with some very overpriced snacks from the concession stand. Even the film quality looked sub par at times as it looked kind of drained of color. I knew I was probably not going to enjoy this one as much as the first due to the main villain being Ultron as he is not a favorite of mine. I just do not see him as being that big a threat seeing as how I have a comic where Spider-man takes him down. However, that is not the only reason I feel this film underwhelms, it is just a bit hard to explain. Overall, I did enjoy the film as there was a bit more action than the previous film and there was some cool stuff going on, but like I said, something about it was off.The story has the Avengers raiding a castle which is a Hydra base right off the bat in the hopes of retrieving the scepter Loki used in the previous Avengers film. At one point a pair of siblings enhanced with strange powers attack and this leads to Iron Man having a bit of an epiphany. This leads him and Dr. Banner trying to create an artificial intelligence to protect the world from threats from space which they plan to dub Ultron. Unfortunately, things do not go as planned and soon Ultron is declaring war on the Avengers and has an extreme way of protecting the world! I will say my favorite Avenger is the Hulk and in the first film they showed how powerful he is. This film, not so much. Probably one of the things I disliked about it. Not only does he not get to really flex his muscles much, the one time he does he is taken down by Iron Man in a really big suit of armor. Anyone who reads the comics knows that the Hulk gets stronger the madder he gets so this whole fight seemed idiotic to me. No way Iron Man takes down Hulk by himself even with 'Hulk Buster' armor. You simply cannot beat Hulk down like they showed in this film, he would have continued to get more angry and torn Tony Starks' Hulk Busting armor completely apart. I have read comics where the Hulk pretty much dominates the entire Avengers team, Iron Man included by himself! So yeah, they completely undersold the Hulk this time.The film did have lots of action which was nice and it did have some good humor here and there, but it just was not up to par with the previous Avengers film. There was a strange relationship that seemed to come out of nowhere, the in fighting kept coming and going and one of the new characters is dispatched in their first film! I also think the part of the film that got my blood going the most was the scene after part of the credits as this scene sets up the villain I wanted this time. Still, it was nice to see them bring in War Machine and the battle at the end was pretty cool too, though it needed more Hulk for my taste. Ultron was done pretty good, as they found a way to make him more of a threat than he usually is in the comics, it just would have been nice if he had more lead up in the previous Marvel films as he came out of left field. I know I seem like I am complaining too much as I did like the film, just did not love it like the first one. Worth a look, but hold your expectations down a little is probably the best way to view it and if the Hulk is not your favorite you should be fine too.",Avengers: Age of Ultron,2395427
62,Hellmant,"It's definitely a mixed bag, but mostly entertaining and satisfying.",9/10,6 May 2015,"'AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Sequel to the 2012 blockbuster superhero flick 'THE AVENGERS'; and the 11th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Joss Whedon returned to write and direct this installment (as he did the first) and most of the cast reprises their roles; including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Samuel L. Jackson, Paul Bettany and Cobie Smulders. Don Cheadle, Anthony Mackie, Idris Elba, Hayley Atwell and others also reprise their parts from other Marvel films; while James Spader, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Elizabeth Olsen and Linda Cardellini join the cast. This time around the mighty superhero team must battle an artificial intelligence unit, created by Tony Stark and Bruce Banner, that's bent on revenge; against all of humanity. I found the film to be entertaining, and it's sure to satisfy most comic book fans, but it's definitely a mixed bag. The story revolves around an A.I. named Ultron (Spader), who comes to life as part of Tony Stark's (Downey Jr.) defense program. Ultron is bent on destroying humanity, instead of protecting it, and enlists the help of two genetically altered twins (Taylor-Johnson and Olsen). He also builds an army of deadly robots, to serve as his army. It's up to the Avengers to stop Ultron and once again save the world.The movie is all over the place; there's a lot of characters and most of them are pretty underdeveloped. We do get to learn more about Hawkeye (Renner) and Black Widow (Johansson), the two Avengers who haven't had their own movies yet, but the rest of the principal players don't have engaging story lines. Thor (Hemsworth) serves as great comic relief; but Stark's one-liners are getting very tired and poorly written. There's also some pretty badly done melodrama (throughout the movie) and an oddly placed romance between Hulk (Ruffalo) and Black Widow (What happened to Betty Ross?!). It's also never explained why Tony Stark came out of retirement and has several suits of armor again (after destroying them all in 'IRON MAN 3'). The action scenes go on for way too long (and are pretty reminiscent of 'MAN OF STEEL', or a Michael Bay 'TRANSFORMERS' film). It does have plenty of good moments too, though, and most die-hard fans will still love it; for all the geeky comic crap it does stay true to. It's just not the most well developed, or balanced, movie (as a result). The first film and some other installments, in the Marvel Universe, are better; but this film is definitely still an entertaining and mostly satisfying addition!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/kdQGbNrUAnk",Avengers: Age of Ultron,2395427

64,drawlife,"Whedon had an impossible task, but he pulls through and exceeds expectations.",7/10,22 April 2015,"Soon after the first Avengers film was released, I could not wait for a sequel, and finally it's here, and it's all I could have hoped for. They're back with a few new additions, and finally a worthy(my favorite villain in the comics) foe, Ultron an AI bent on destroying humanity, at the same time putting the team in despair. I'll start with some of the nitpicks. This is very rare, but I think Age of Ultron could have used an extra 10-15 minutes. Whedon in an interview stated he cut out some back story for the twins, which I think was a mistake, I wasn't particularly fond of them in the beginning, but as the film progressed they grew on me a lot. This time around Whedon brings a butt-load of action, and better action I might add, but while in the first film there were moments that lasted too long to take a breather from the action, in Age of Ultron he doesn't allow us a moment to catch our breath too often, very sporadically. But, he finds away to keep things interesting. Barely shorter than the first film, it's still a long film regardless and it does not feel like it. This time around Whedon allows The Avengers to be The Avengers. They're together a lot more and their dynamic and relationship is a joy to watch. The original six, Downey Jr., Evans, Hemsworth, Ruffalo, Johansson, and Renner are all fantastic. Johansson's Black Widow and Renner's Hawkeye in particular have quite an impressive arc in this film and an argument can be made that Hawkeye is the main character, there's also a brilliant, fun tongue in cheek moment he has with Scarlet Witch. Also he got the best lines in the film aside from James Spader who by the way is an excellent villain. Ultron in this film has a personality. He is a scene stealer and commands the screen every time he's in it. He's got some humor, but I would have liked more menace within him. There are two moments where he became very threatening, and the film could have used a bit more. Although his plan for destruction is quite impactful and quite intimidating, he sorta feels lost, as do some of the characters because the film is so saturated and overstuffed to a degree. I'd also like to mention that Samuel L. Jackson and Cobie Smulders serve their roles well, but in a populated film like this they're roles are obviously reduced a bit, and to my surprise Don Cheadle's War Machine finally gets some action, despite it being small. The new additions Elizabeth Olsen, Aaron Johnson, and Paul Bettany are solid and only bring extra flare into the film's ingredients. Scarlet Witch is quite well realized, a little more than Quicksilver I might I add, and she is fun to watch and causes some inner damage to the team. Speaking of Quicksilver, Whedon wisely tries not to match or outdo the X-Men Quicksilver, and in doing so he's more grounded and a little more developed than Singer's, who just used him for an impressive sequence. Paul Bettany's Vision is also another scene stealer. He was incredible in the film, and as a last minute surprise he does not disappoint. Vision is arguably one of my favorite characters growing up and Whedon works him into the film the way I'd hope it be. Kudos to Whedon. I mentioned the action before in my nitpicks, but the action here is top notch and Whedon finds a way to keep you focused. A lot of teamwork is involved in almost every action set piece and you feel what's at stake as the team also takes cue to actually save civilians. It's just a fireworks of action displayed on screen and the scale of it is so very impressive. Hulkbuster vs Hulk in particular is a standout sequence, as does everything that has to do with Vision. But aside from the action, Whedon manages to juggle every single character and somehow make them as relevant as they can be, some obviously more than others, but it's just amazing to see it all unfold. He understands these characters as the heavy moments work well and he never forgets the heroes' humanity. There are also hints to films in the future, but they don't saturate the main plot, but enough to keep you aware. Joss Whedon had an incredible challenge to make a sequel to the first film. I think one can argue that the novelty wore off a bit because in the first film, it was something that was never been seen before and as it was released it was, and I use the term ""done already,"" and going into this sequel, it won't be able to recapture that magic of the first because ""it's been done already."" I know I sound like I'm fanboying, and that's because I am(no apologizes), but if you overlook all that, the film is as good as it gets. It's almost impossible to make a movie like this and not have it feel repetitive. Not to mention, it's impossible to have so many characters and have a completely satisfying characterization for all of them, and I think in the hands of another filmmaker who not only writes, but also directs would more or less likely fail. Joss got the job done, but one can notice corporate meddling was taken place, as it is a big crowd drawing film for everyone. I think the Russo's and the writing team of Markus and McFeely are the prefect candidates to take over the glorious Avenger films. I believe they nail the darker tone a lot better than anyone else. The film has no end-credits stinger, but stick around for the mid-credit scene. It's so good. 7.5/10",Avengers: Age of Ultron,2395427
65,mistoppi,Don't expect too much and you won't be disappointed,3/10,22 April 2015,"Joss Whedon's writing is decent, but if something bothers me, it's the cheap jokes. They are used constantly, and they just are so cheesy and almost forced. Most of the audience loved them though, so maybe that works to some kind of audience.The structure of the plot was very similar to the first Avengers, though that isn't a surprise. I don't think anyone is expecting a complicated, mind-blowing plot. The story is simple, it's decent. The fight scenes seemed much clearer this time, it was a lot easier to see what was happening and where, and who was involved. I don't know if it was just due to cinematography or effects, or the fact that I was watching a 2D version.I was kind of hoping more from Ultron. I wanted a character who was actually scary, a villain you couldn't defend. Well, you probably can't really defend Ultron, except for the obvious â€“ him being a robot. But he still seemed too likable. He was kind of too humane, almost funny. James Spader was wonderful though, and his voice alone was enough to make Ultron scary when needed.The movie had its funny moments, exciting moments, pseudo-deep moments, and the weirdly surprising moments. But why did they need to add romance? It seemed sort of forced.In short, Avengers Age of Ultron is decent, so don't get your expectations high. But it is worth seeing, otherwise it's hard to keep up with the world in these movies.",Avengers: Age of Ultron,2395427
66,kieranbattams,there are no strings to hold this movie down.,10/10,24 April 2015,"Once in a while a film comes around which raises your expectations so high and excites so much that it seems they cannot be exceeded so simply. Yet we are talking about a Marvel Cinematic Universe movie here, full of the fun, humour and characters that have never failed to disappoint before. I can safely say that my reasoning for Avengers Age of Ultron being my most anticipated film for 3 years is totally justified and it did not disappoint in any way. The emotions it left me feeling were some of the best i have felt for a long time and throughout i was smiling and felt like i was a member of the team Marvel have spent so long building up, and they are very much a team here taking us on a journey much bigger than the first and in many ways better.The film opens with an incredible action sequence and stays that way until the very end of the post-credits scene which has become a staple at the very core of Marvel. Here Tony Stark has been working on a dormant peace keeping programme that is set to save the world so that the Avengers aren't needed anymore and can take a well deserved break. Enter Ultron, played as perfectly as a fan could wish for with the chilling voice of James Spader who gives real depth to a character who had to be done right to be brought to the screen. The Avengers assemble once again to counter Ultron who sees them as the only threat to the world he is sworn to protect and on the way encounter twins Scarlett Witch and Quicksilver who are insanely awesome characters. A lot of fans worried that Aaron-Taylor Johnson would be a disappointment compared to the perfect portrayal in last years Xmen film but i can say safely that they are two very different takes on Quicksilver and that they both did absolutely brilliant jobs. Elisabeth Olsen as Scarlett Witch again also provides us with a huge deal of depth and really makes the character her own. I must say though whilst everybody in the film, and i mean everybody, did a phenomenal job the standout is definitely Paul Bettany as the Vision. Without spoilers i can say without a doubt that he is the best character for me and is brought to the screen as perfectly as anyone could have imagined to counter the bad-ass Ultron. Joss Whedon gives it his all and that is definitely no understatement.Each Avenger has their own demons to battle and we get to know them so much better than we already did. In particular what i loved was firstly the relationship between not only Bruce Banner and Black Widow but also the relationship she had with the Hulk. They played off each other so well. Black Widow really got to shine here. We knew the back stories of the Avengers because we got to see them in standalone films but hers is finally told to us and Scarlett Johansson brings a real feel of emotion to her character that we haven't previously gotten to know. We also get Thor who has demons to battle and we see more of an insight as to what is going on in his head and Captain America who is coming to grips with the life he has been given in modern times which was explored subtlety but very well. Also i know you are all wondering, yes the Iron man Hulkbuster vs Hulk fight was incredible and nothing short of spectacular. I loved Hulk in this film as he was more than the muscle of the team and the fight with Stark was given context instead of being thrown in for the fun of it (but that doesn't mean it isn't fun). Plus i was very happy to see Hawkeye was given a huge deal of screen time, he was bad-ass and shone a new light on him as a character which was awesome.A couple minor flaws, but they are minor are that Ultron did have less screen time than i hoped. He was awesome but you almost want to see more by the conclusion. Also the post-credits scene was pretty cool but so short and i just wish i could have seen a little more in terms of set-up. Other than that you will not find a better time at the cinema and i doubt that will change for the rest of the year.Avengers Age of Ultron is without a doubt my number one MCU film and featured all the action, humour and characters that we are promised and more. War Machine even shows up for the fun as well as Falcon even if only for a small time. Plus Nick Fury was as great as ever. All balanced with a slight dose of dark elements and we are given the perfect summer movie to enjoy again and again. Will be seeing it again on Sunday for sure. I am in love with everything about this film at the minute including the incredible soundtrack. ""Didn't see that coming?"" Neither did i. ""There are no strings on me"".",Avengers: Age of Ultron,2395427

68,Brownsbros3,This is why I like I movies,10/10,5 May 2015,"If you don't like this movie, there is something wrong with you! The advertisement says, ""The most fun you'll have at the theaters this summer."" They are right on the money. I had a blast! I don't go to movies to over-analyze and critique every little detail. I go to the movies to have fun. I love how they set this up on Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., and then the movie picks up right where the episode leaves off. I like that they had Robert Downey Jr. go back to being the charismatic, wisecracking Tony Stark that made the first Iron Man film so cool. The running gag with Captain America objecting to the rest of the crew using bad language was hilarious. The visual effects were amazing in 3-D. My favorite was the return of the S.H.I.E.L.D. Heli-carrier. Hawkeye having a wife and kids was a nice surprise. As far as the whining goes about Black Widow taking a back seat to the rest of the guys, I really didn't see it that way. The Avengers are a team. They fight together. I didn't really see any one Avenger in the movie outshining the rest of the group. While all the focus was on Widow, they completely forget about Wanda a.k.a. the Scarlet Witch. After Hawkeye's pep talk, she comes out blasting everything in sight, and earns herself a spot on the team. The swerve of Quicksilver sacrificing himself to save Hawkeye and the little boy was really well done. All movie long it kept looking like Hawkeye was the one that was going to die. James Spader was a great villain as the voice of Ultron. I would have toned down the comedy a little bit though. Some of his lines seemed out of place for an evil robot wanting to kill all mankind. I also liked that they started setting up the pieces for the next series of movies; Captain America:Civil War, Black Panther, Thor:Ragnarok, and Avengers:Infinity War.",Avengers: Age of Ultron,2395427
69,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Somewhat over-whelming, but still a pretty spectacular ride",7/10,12 May 2015,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Opening in the action, the Avengers have been sent to rescue some people from a mad doctor in the Alps, who wants to experiment on them. Among them are a brother and sister pair, who possess special powers of their own, but who hold a grudge against Tony Stark, as they remember seeing a weapon made by his company lying in the rubble, after their parents were killed in the war torn country they are from. But after the mission's success, Stark becomes the spanner in the works again, when he talks fellow scientist Bruce Banner in to meddling with nature and opening the peacekeeping program Ultron to secure harmony in the world. Big mistake, as Ultron forms a life of it's own, and decides to try and wipe out the human race and replace it with his own kind.Having unthinkably missed the original Avengers spectacle on the big screen three years ago, no way was I going to miss Joss Whedon's inevitable sequel, which promised to be bigger, badder and balsier than the last one, as they always do. This may be the case, but it hardly makes it better, as such. And, as grand and outside the box as it may be, that is the case. The follow up, like it's main antagonist Stark, is a victim of it's own blind ambition, a relentless, none stop roller coaster ride that bombards you with flash all the way to the end, and just leaves you over-whelmed. With Stark being the main character, and Robert Downey Jr. being the biggest star, it falls to reason that most of the attention falls on them, with even the publicity before the film's release (notably Jr's unfortunate walk-out interview with Tristram Guru Murphy or whatever his name is) maybe tying in with the hype.At nearly three hours, the film is just too over-loaded and over ambitious, getting carried away with itself and just leaving the viewer feeling deflated by the end as a result. It would be one thing if there were some exciting bits throughout, but there's too many long stretches where nothing exciting happens that make it even more too much. Going on this long, it stands to reason that too much must be going on with the plot, which just gets a little over-complicated and at times none coherent.Like the predecessor, however, it wisely keeps it's tongue in it's cheek, and the gang (especially, as ever, Stark) are always at their wise cracking best, it's still a dazzlingly colourful spectacle with, at times, jaw dropping action and visual effects and, again, it works better with them all as one than as separate entities on their own. The original, however, wisely kept it all at an endurable running time, so you could appreciate these qualities more, while this follow up goes overboard and, for all it's strengths, is just a little too much as a result. ***",Avengers: Age of Ultron,2395427
70,chrishayes737,Better then I could have imagined .,10/10,22 April 2015,"I saw Age of Ultron last night here in New Zealand yes that's right U.S.A I saw it on the 22nd of April ! and OMG this goes up a level on the last Avengers , if I could rate it higher than 10 then I would...it's blew me away especially when the Avengers had to get recruit 3 more Avengers just to beat Ultron & Ultron is the coolest villain you have ever seen & superbly voiced by Spader . All the gang is at their best & the humor is excellent & just the right amount , the action is amazing & the cgi looks fantastic...Hawke eye's role is expanded & we learn a lot more about him & we also learn more about Black Widow & I love the romance between her & Hulk . Age of Ultron also sets up Civil War & Infinity war so buckle in those should be just as awesome .",Avengers: Age of Ultron,2395427
71,glennmeerten06,Worthy of Thor's hammer!,8/10,4 May 2015,"Even up to this day, I regret not seeing The Avengers in theaters when it came out! I'm in love with the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Iron Man, Captain America and the Guardians of the Galaxy... Just writing down the titles gets me excited. The Avengers would be the culmination of all these epic superheroes! And by god it was! It was clever, it was fast, it was epic, it was funny, it was awesome! The Avengers set the bar at such a level, the curse of bad sequels was bound to pop up its nasty head. Well, with great pleasure, I can say it hasn't. Avengers: Age of Ultron (without ""The"" for some reason) is so much fun it's crazy. The action is quick, epic and on point. The teamwork is so awesome: just think about combining Cap's shield and Thor's hammer and let your imagination run wild. That's what the creators of AOU did with the action scenes: just let their creativity flow and use these amazing super abilities and just mix and mash them together to create some epic visuals. The story is quite interesting: Tony Stark wants to create a robotic army of peacekeepers to take over from the Avengers and make them no longer needed. This backfires when his creation Ultron activates and his A.I. concludes that humanity's extinction is the only way to ensure peace on earth. It's interesting to see the cracks develop within the team. The twin who were teased at the end of The Winter Soldier come to the scene and start stirring up trouble. I was so happy to see Hawk Eye shine in the flick. In part one he was just a stool for the freaking awesome Loki for most of the film but now he gets so much more to do and he's just such a lovable character! Visually, Age of Ultron is up to par with previous Marvel movies. It looks great, especially the climax of the movie is just a joy to watch. I had some gripes with the film though. For starters I found it quite odd to see Iron Man just doing his thing when it wasn't explained how he came back from his retirement after Iron Man 3. I'm glad he's back but some info would be nice. Secondly there's a romance which feels out of place because it wasn't earned in previous movies. It kind of feels forced and out of the blue. The music is epic and grand. The Avengers theme is back and it's awesome! Summary: Fun and epic sequel with minor gripes.",Avengers: Age of Ultron,2395427

73,ferguson-6,No Strings on Me,7/10,17 May 2015,"Greetings again from the darkness. Joss Whedon returns as writer/director for the sequel to his 2012 blockbuster The Avengers, and this time he juggles an exceptionally large and talented group of characters and actors who are not only involved in good versus evil, but also in the battle for screen time.There is no shortage of write-ups from film critics and fanboys who have analyzed every aspect of the movie from every possible angle, and while I admit to taking that same approach to most movies, there is something about the Marvel movies that cause me to flip off the film critic part of my brain and just sit back and enjoy. And enjoy I do. The characters are fun and interesting and the action is at time breath-taking.Since there are, by my count, at least 23 actors who deserve mention, it makes little sense for me to list them here. It is worth noting that the key actors all reprise their roles as Avengers, and many of those in supporting roles are back as well. This time there are also many significant newcomers, and those include ""The Twins"" â€“ Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Quicksilver and Elizabeth Olsen as Scarlet Witch. Other newbies include Linda Cardellini (""Mad Men"","" Bloodline"") as Hawkeye's wife, Claudia Kim as Dr Helen Cho, Thomas Kretschmann as Strucker, and Andy Serkis as Ulysses Klaue. Though each is a nice addition, it's the stellar voice work of James Spader as Ultron that really makes this movie click. Somehow Mr. Spader manages to convey a powerful presence despite maintaining a (mostly) even keel throughout. It's masterful voice acting.Missing this time out are Pepper Potts and Loki, though we hardly notice thanks to the first look at Vision (Paul Bettany) and Thanos (Josh Brolin) Â… plus the unveiling of Iron Man's Hulkbuster armor. If you thought the first Avengers movie made it difficult to keep up with the characters, this one will have your head spinning. It's probably the only quibble I have with it Â… character overload at the expense of character development. The Hawkeye family farm represents a meager attempt to have this group of superheroes set in a ""normal"" environment, but it just doesn't quite work. The Avengers are at their best while snipping at each other or saving the planet Â… fortunately the movie offers plenty of the latter.",Avengers: Age of Ultron,2395427
74,ThunderKing6,Better than Avengers 1,9/10,19 October 2020,"I feel AAOU was a better movie than its first. Visually and story wise it out beats A1 by 69%.The movie is about a killer robot created by the ""good"" guy who is having traumatic episodes since A1. He builds an AI who wants to be the saviour of this ugly earth by giving it a gift of destruction.Cap: Was good. Shown he is a leader. OP is some places.Iron man: an immature jerk he caused ultron and didn't get punished.Hulk and widow: sissy Black widow subplotThor: had good fight scenes but was a side character at best.Ultron: is nothing like the comics. He is more like a evil clown robot without make up.Hawkeye: they could utilize this character but they wasted him instead.Quicksilver and the witch: I thought QS was the coolest and best of the two. Sad he didn't see it coming. The Witch is alright.Overall its a fun superhero flick. Like many mcu movies before it has plot holes and unanswered question such as Vision lifting up Thor's hammer. They never purely explained it.from start to creating ultron felt rushed. Its basically the movie starts, Stark creates ultron and ultron arrives. I didn't like it. There was no build up.Verdict: its just an mcu movie, but it was a fun movie nevertheless.",Avengers: Age of Ultron,2395427
75,neil-476,"Just short of the first one, but still pretty stellar",9/10,24 April 2015,"Tony Stark has only a couple of days access to Loki's staff, newly recovered by the Avengers in a sweep of Hydra lairs, before Thor returns it to Asgard. He is keen to incorporate the advanced technology in the staff's power source into his global protection system, Ultron. But something goes very wrong as it turns out that Ultron is both self-aware and malevolent, and assisted by a pair of twins with unusual talents. It's time for the team to regroup.As Marvel adds each new film, it becomes increasingly apparent that, just like the comics on which they are based, one long, ongoing story is being told. In Avengers 2, we see payoffs and further developments from things which were seeded in earlier films (by which I mean the entire Marvel cinematic universe), and which look to payoff in the future.This film doesn't quite have the cocky swagger which its predecessor had, but that is perhaps because we are now very familiar with every member of the team, and how well they function as a team. The film is great fun, nevertheless. It is maybe missing moments like Hulk's rag doll Loki incident, but there are still a number of moments which had me drooling deliriously with delight, and I nearly wet myself during the first 5 minutes.The new characters are great â€“ Ultron is particularly well realised â€“ and there are more returning characters than a Harry Potter film (well, not quite, but you know what I mean). I'm glad I managed to avoid the rumour mill, although I did catch the suggestion that a certain character might die. What can I say? Wars have casualties.This is another very successful movie in the Marvel series â€“ roll on Ant-Man!",Avengers: Age of Ultron,2395427
76,rjsf96,Whedon Unleashes Our Inner Nerd,7/10,23 April 2015,"We all knew Joss Whedon faced an impossible task with 'Avengers: Age of Ultron'. To not only craft a sequel that was as great as 'The Avengers', but one which beats the competition without question. Needless to say, Whedon succeeds marvellously. You know you are in for a film of magnificence, when the opening prologue bests its predecessor in every conceivable way.The Avengers are a powerful team. Yet they will inevitably meet their doom, one day or another. Tony Stark knows this better than anyone. He confides in Bruce Banner (AKA the Hulk), that the Avengers need an end game, a way out from their super heroic deeds. Together they create the thing that they dread ""UltronÂ…in the flesh"". Ultron is an artificial intelligence system, who is created with the sole intention of making the world safe; this is because the Avengers cannot protect the world forever. Once Ultron questions his creator and rebels against him, he believes that a better world is one which The Avengers do not inhabit. Ultron teams up with brother and sister duo; Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch to destroy the team, once and for all.The cast for 'Avengers: Age of Ultron' is impeccable, with old friends and new foes alike. The heroes are Iron Man (a witty Robert Downey Jr.), the Hulk (the subtle Mark Ruffalo), Thor (a god-like Chris Hemsworth) and Captain America (a righteous Chris Evans.) Joining them are assassins Hawkeye (a keen Jeremy Renner) and Black Widow (an emotional Scarlett Johansson.) On the opposing side are Scarlet Witch (an illuminating Elizabeth Olsen) and Quicksilver (a supersonic Aaron Taylor-Johnson.) The big baddie with global domination on his mind every waking minute is Ultron. He is voiced by James Spader, who oozes determination, power and intimidation. The key thing of note about Ultron is that he is intelligent and resourceful, not a lumbering henchman with dumb schemes. Ultron has a plan, one which he does not entirely divulge to The Avengers. It's so good to not be bombarded by exposition, which is far too present in the X-Men franchise. Avengers could teach it a thing or two.The action set pieces have been thoroughly thought out; this gave me the impression that the production and animation team left nothing up to chance. The first fifteen minutes feature enough excitement on their own to put Bond out of business for good. We are introduced in this sequence to all the major players and briefly glimpse Ultron's final form. Furthermore, the fight that sees Iron Man don the Hulk Buster Armour in an attempt to stop an out of control Hulk from causing higher levels of chaos is breath taking. I literally lost my mind and I am certain that any other audience member will as well.Joss Whedon excels not just at action, but with the dialogue and characters. Each and every person on screen feels fully formed and defined. This time there is no weak link glaringly present. Hawkeye was underutilised in 'The Avengers', however in 'Age of Ultron' we care more about him. This is because we discover many secrets to his and other character's pasts. The most intriguing of which is the character of Natasha Romanoff (Black Widow) whom sees a glimpse of how she became an assassin and her vulnerability; this gives her feeling, thus in the process making her seem less two dimensional than she arguably was before. The lines are witty and still retain emotion. 'Age of Ultron' has a heart that the majority of comic book films can only aspire to. Tony Stark is extremely funny, able to provide laughs amid the ongoing destruction. Bruce Banner is thoughtful, wondering if the Hulk is the darker side of his personality. Thor says the wrong thing frequently that provokes the enemy and Captain America is the soul of the film, bringing the heroes to fight together against Ultron in the climactic, unbelievable battle, which left me lost for words. I have rarely experienced such a feeling and 'Age of Ultron' had me regularly gasping, cheering and crying. Bless Joss Whedon who brings heart, humour and soul to The Avengers. I am left utterly speechless and cannot imagine regaining this feeling until 'Avengers: Infinity War Part I' which will be released in 2018.As cinematographer Ben Davis can do no wrong. Having previously photographed 'Guardians of the Galaxy', it is clear that with 'Age of Ultron' he is relaxed and in his element. No praise I could give him would be sufficient. The score composed by Danny Elfman and Brian Tyler is what fan boys like me; hear in their heads, when imagining their favourite heroes being brought to life. I'm still humming the theme tune and will be buying the soundtrack upon its release. What pleased me the most about the score was the inclusion of Alan Silvestri's Avengers theme, what a tremendous homage indeed.Mightier than Thor's hammer, funnier than Stark's trademark wit and smarter than Banner's brain; 'Avengers: Age of Ultron' is a comic book film that rules above all others.",Avengers: Age of Ultron,2395427
77,welhof1,Good but missing something 7.5,7/10,22 November 2021,"I loved the first one, 10/10. This one was just missing something. It had all the ingredients. I think it was the main villain. I'm not a fan of James Spader's smug voice so maybe that's why I didn't enjoy it. There was way too much CGI. It was very well done, just too much of it. Also I didn't get a lot of reason why Ultron did what he wanted to do. He just did it with little explanation.Also where were the laughs? There are usually some well placed lines in these films but I didn't see many.Solid sequel though.

This is one well crafted, superhero and super fun..As for the characters and cast , All the returning cast are as good as they have been in previous installments.Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Pietro Maximoff/Quicksilver his acting is as expected personally I find him to be a good actor.Then we have Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda Maximoff/Scarlett Witch, another extremely talented actress in my opinion, she was brilliant in this too..The runtime does seem long however, there is enough going on at every turn that you kind of forget how long you have been watching and that is a good thing.All in all its a best Marvels movie, and if you're a fan of Marvel, Superheros or action films in general, you have to see this. :)",Avengers: Age of Ultron,2395427
79,Vishal_s_kumar,Avengers Assemble...Again!!!,10/10,30 April 2015,"After a three year break to tend to the specifics of these costumed men and women, the A-Team has reunited for ""Avengers: Age of Ultron,"" a darker, more internalized follow-up that still retains all the expected bang and boom. Writer/director Joss Whedon has pulled off an impressive feat here, sustaining the intensity of a ripping adventure yarn while digging into a few of the characters a little more deeply, finding fresh ground to cover in a more satisfying epic.After taking care of Loki and the Chitauri invasion, the Avengers, including Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Dr. Bruce Banner/Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Clint Barton/Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), and Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans), are off to shut down human experimentation efforts from Hydra leader Baron Wolfgang von Strucker (Thomas Kretschmann), who's found two particularly gifted subjects in Wanda/Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and Pietro Maximoff/Quicksilver (Aaron-Taylor Johnson) -- powerful twins out to punish Stark for his war profiteering. Claiming success, the Avengers enjoy a rare moment of peace, only to find their confidence shattered by Ultron (voiced by James Spader), a monstrous robot powered by Stark's unwieldy research into artificial intelligence, where he hoped to retire Iron Man by assembling a robot strike force to protect the innocent. As Ultron grows in power, he recruits Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver, with plans to slaughter the Avengers and destroy humankind as a way to create the perfect world order.In keeping with Marvel momentum, ""Age Of Ultron"" opens in mid-battle, returning to the individual powers and technologies of the heroes as they steamroll into the Eastern European town of Sokovia, where the last traces of Hydra remain. It's a thunderous sequence, energetically following the team into enemy territory, with fluid CGI and soaring camera-work creating a roll call for the protagonists, watching Thor beat soldiers with his fist and hammer, and Iron Man control the skies with his arsenal and quips. Whedon is terrific with introductions, reviving the feeling of teamwork and power that made the original feature irresistible at times, stepping back to watch this collection of personalities and power crush evil. The story also kicks in immediately, sharing the details of Hydra's secretive mission and renewed interest in the Infinity Gems, while introducing a unique threat in the Scarlet Witch (a master of telekinesis and hypnosis) and Quicksilver (super-speed). It takes Ultron a good 30 minutes to get up and running, yet the sequel is already stuffed with enough information to keep the narrative humming along, waiting patiently for the towering villain.Born from an A.I. program similar to Stark's J.A.R.V.I.S. system, Ultron takes form as colossal robot, retaining his childlike observance of the world, demanding a fresh start for the mechanical age. Backed by legion of drones, Ultron is a formidable foe, with developing smarts and a curious case of impatience guiding his initial domination. However, while his strength is significant, he needs Scarlet Witch to truly take down the Avengers, with her powers of mental manipulation digging into the fear and confusion the superheroes have kept hidden. This psychological warfare is a major plot point in ""Age of Ultron,"" pinpointing Avenger vulnerabilities in a way they're unprepared for and, for a brute like Hulk, mind manipulation results in destructive puppetry, forcing Iron Man into caretaker mode, with a mid-movie sequence detailing an uncharacteristic fight between the two, with Stark prepared for such a day, suiting up in Hulkbuster armor. Captain America is hit with visions from his past, Thor is handed a strange, apocalyptic puzzle of guilt, and Black Widow is confronted with her traumatic past, trained at a young age to become a killer. The addition of emotional wounds and the way Scarlet Witch accesses them is a welcome opening into the ongoing inspection of Avenger insecurities, adding some substance to the confection, while strengthening the team dynamic as they grow tighter as a security unit.Warmth is also new to the franchise. In ""Age of Ultron,"" Banner becomes a romantic fixation for Romanoff, with their beauty and the beast pairing giving the heroes something more profound to explore than the simplicity of a haunted past. Instead of indulging the Iron Man Show, Whedon spreads attention around the group, finding a few sweet, mournful beats to play as Banner retreats from his love interest, fearful of the monster he is, while his heart aches for companionship. The miracle of ""Age of Ultron"" is Hawkeye, watching the oft-maligned character stand upright for change, showing boldness during skirmishes, awareness of his oddity, and domesticity with his secret family. Humanizing this strange addition to the Avengers is Whedon's greatest achievement, giving the character purpose and depth that makes his subplot perhaps to most fulfilling of the bunch. In a picture filled with gargantuan action sequences and world-crushing enemies, the highlight of the sequel is the chance to see Hawkeye hug his wife and children. Whedon is a real superhero for pulling off that trick.Humor isn't completely scrubbed from ""Age of Ultron,"" which keeps up a rhythm of wisecracks and banter -- even the titular robot overlord is allowed some sarcasm. The scope of the movie is massive, running around the globe to thwart evil, figure out why Ultron is after a shipment of vibranium, and reunite with old friends. Seeds are planted for future chapters in Marvel Cinematic Universe, finding Rogers and Stark developing heated ideological differences as the lure of technology and the demands of safety collide. Whedon doesn't sacrifice the core unit to feed corporate demands, with enough time devoted to heroics and interplay to keep the picture satisfying, giving fans the Avengers dosage they demand. ""Age of Ultron"" manages to improve on its predecessor in numerous ways, smartly building on its foundation of trial and error.",Avengers: Age of Ultron,2395427
80,moviewizguy,"In Whedon, without the Studio Controlling Him, We Trust",6/10,2 May 2015,"Watching AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON can be summed up with the following words: entertaining, exhausting, and overstuffed. It's also one of the few summer action blockbusters that feels like it could have been better without all those incomprehensible, *forced* action scenes, in which the quiet character scenes between them are so much more memorable and interesting. With the numerous characters, even more so than the first, it's a miracle, then, that director Joss Whedon somehow manages to make the sequel coherent, balanced, and well paced. In the hands of a lesser director, the film could have been a disaster in more ways than one. Still, you can't help but feel Whedon going off a check list to satisfy fans of these superheroes, preventing the film to reach its potential (see: the cliffhanger ending setting up the inevitable sequel). Whedon takes some risks with this one, but overall, he plays it safe.

81,apstylianou,The best film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe so far (spoiler free),7/10,30 April 2015,"Avengers: Age of Ultron is exactly what I wanted it to be, a fine sequel with solid pacing, directing, acting, eye gouging special effects and awesome action sequences. Before going to see this film, I looked back to the greatest movie sequels ever to make a comparison, Terminator 2, The Empire Strikes Back, The Dark Knight, (I haven't seen The Godfather Part II yet), and Avengers: Age of Ultron is definitely on the same level as all of those films. My favourite film in the MCU was undeniably Guardians of the Galaxy, but I gotta say that AOU is the best Marvel movie ever since GOTG.The cast did a fantastic job, and I literally mean each and every one of them. Robert Downey, Jr. threw it down, Chris Evans is there shining in his well-acted portrayal as Captain America, Chris Hemsworth is at his very best, Scarlett Johanson is also at her very badass best (and quite flirtatious as well I might add), Mark Ruffalo was amazing as Bruce Banner/Hulk, but Jeremy Renner stood out to me on top of all of the team. He's not my favourite Avenger, but Hawkeye was at first to me the least important guy on the team, and I thought that because he had a lack of character development in the first Avengers, but now they've done a terrific improvement on his character and they have developed him much better this time with quite an emotional core and some very good one-liners.The newcomers, I can say, without hesitation, the same for as well. Elizabeth Olsen and Aaron-Taylor Johnson did a brilliant job as the two mutant twins. I do think that Evan Peters was a better version of Quicksilver when he played him in X-Men: Days of Future Past. Paul Bettany as the Vision was a show-stealer as well and he offered us his best in a well directed superhero movie. However, the newcomers all pale in comparison to James Spader's Ultron. I can see now why the cast and crew applauded him for his performance. Ultron was the real show stealer of the film and probably the best villain in the MCU and he is definitely up there with the greatest movie villains of all time, even reaching the same level as The Joker and Darth Vader. Whenever he's on screen, the movie sets the dark mood.So all in all, this is one of my favourite superhero movies ever and better than the first Avengers film in my opinion. It has a well placed focus on the title characters, the Avengers and Ultron, and after that, it has an awesome set up to Phase 3.My one problem with it is that the film wasn't as dark as the trailers suggested it would be. I just think that there should've been a little more to set the mood. It definitely does set the mood as dark as it was in Captain America: The Winter Soldier, I will say that.Still, I strongly recommend you see this one. Do not miss it.",Avengers: Age of Ultron,2395427
82,eddie_baggins,"Not a home run like the first, this is still blockbuster filmmaking done right",8/10,22 April 2015,"I don't believe many would argue against us being a spoilt generation, a generation that expects a great deal and expects it better and faster each time. It's a mindset that encompasses most of our everyday life, whether we are waiting for our next coffee, our next parcel of goods ordered over the internet, there are countless aspects of our everyday life that we now merely take for granted, a state of being that has stemmed to most facets of our life including our movie watching tastes and expectations. In the ever increasing world domination of the Marvel universe, comic book lovers and superhero loving cinema patrons have been treated to a plethora of big screen spectacles over the recent years, particularly within the last decade. In that time we've been witness to arguably the greatest ever molding of characters and material with the incredibly popular and rightfully well-loved The Avengers. The Avengers was everything you could want from a movie featuring men in tights, angry green beasts and an archer with a never-ending supply of arrows, and us being the generation we are wanted more, we wanted it faster, better and more blowing so how does Age of Ultron satisfy the needs of its fervent watchers? It was always going to be an extremely tough task for Marvel and director Joss Whedon to top the first Avengers and many will ask as a first point of call if Age of Ultron is as good or better than the first and to answer that straight up you'd have to say no. A no answer is anything but bad news however as Age of Ultron still possesses the quick-fire wit, the stunning imagery and fantastic camaraderie between the films many stars that made the first such a memorable adventure. Suffice to say much of the film's original novelty value of seeing the crew of heroes assemble for the first time is now largely gone but there growing relationships and angst that comes from time spent with one another is an interesting and well developed aspect of this new tale. There's potential love, pent up anger and some great double teaming of bad guys within the crack team and with Whedon's assured direction and scripting, Age of Ultron continues to be a step above other comic book movies in virtually all aspects. With seemingly all great aspects of the first Avengers intact here again what makes Ultron a lesser affair is sadly in it titular bad guy. Loki became the perfect foe for our first outing in the Avengers movie, with Tom Hiddleston's great performance and some great lore behind his anger, he made for a thoroughly dastardly villain and one you couldn't take your eyes whenever he was on screen. In James Spader's Ultron we have a ""big bad"" that initially looks to steal the show only to become a character that is less the sum of his parts due to murky motivation and some seriously questionable quick production times on his evil plans. Spader does a great job of both his motion capture and voice work and is what I'd imagine a fantastic incarnation of the comic book favourite but there is something severely lacking in his progression in the film that holds this 2 hour plus story back. In other minor quibbles it feels as though both Scarlett Witch and Quicksilver are underused in what feels like an arc that would've benefited from these new additions more whilst being the spoilt cinema goers we are it does feel as though our grand finale is a little lacking especially when compared to the city leveling joys of the first outings showpiece or even this films incredibly fun Hulk rampage, who by the way is an ardent of Beats by Dr. Dre, who would've thought?. With expectations high and with pre-hype at all new boisterous levels, Age of Ultron has some mighty goals to meet and while it doesn't feel like the home run of the first it most certainly is a hugely enjoyable big budget blockbuster that's wittier than countless so called comedies and more original than many of marvels recent diminishing adventures. We all know what the cast here can deliver and there all sufficiently on song and it's with great pleasure I can say Iron Man doesn't dominate every scene as his been known to do in the past so the load of quips and funnies is shared mostly evenly between our rag tag group.Regardless of what one was to say about Age of Ultron its going to make Marvel and its parent companies a huge stash of money and as long as Marvel keeps producing Avenger films to this quality no one will begrudge them their success even though chinks in the previously untouchable armor are starting to show. So with that, we farewell Whedon you good sir, it's over to you Russo Brothers, we'll see you in a few years! 4 suspect zucchini references out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check into - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",Avengers: Age of Ultron,2395427
83,michaelhirakida,"Honest Review: Good Film, But Inferior Sequel",7/10,1 May 2015,"After Tony Stark unleashes a robotic madman he and the team of Avengers will Have to destroy him and all his counterparts as Ultron plans to destroy all of humankind in this newest Avengers Film.I must say, in the past few days I was extremely hyped up about the film. After the last superhero film Guardians of The Galaxy, I hoped the Avengers brought something better. It did, but it is an inferior sequel.I will try to keep this review Spoiler Free also since I don't want to ruin any of the hype to people who haven't seen it.The Villain Ultron (James Spader) is a dang great villain. He is more of a gentleman of a villain than Loki was, but dang, Ultron looks cool, sounds cool, acts cool, it's a good villain.Other characters appear as well as Vision, Quicksilver, Scarlet Witch and some others return like The Falcon (But only for two appearances) which is great to see. The Stan Lee Cameo was also funny as always.The Main Characters were great also. Bruce and Natasha get more development and we find out something great about Hawkeye Also. The performances by Evans, Downey, Hemsworth, Ruffalo, Spader, Taylor Johnson are all good and it's nice to see a bit more variety in characters.The visuals are what you expect. Standard level CGI big effects that sometimes can look outstanding but most of the time are nothing new. The climax is pretty good with the visuals but overall the visuals ain't nothing to howl for.The Story, Meh. It could have used a bit more originality. We have seen the whole villain motivation before but the film does a good job with how it's done.If you are expecting another post credits scene, don't expect it here, there is a mid credits scene which I will not reveal but prepare to be disappointed when there is nothing after the credits.Sorry If the review was not useful but I feel like I don't need to explain much of what has already been said. The audience I was with gasped at this one particular part of the film, but you will have to see what it is. Avengers Age Of Ultron is a inferior sequel in the fact that it's a cookie cutter been there done that formula. But hopefully for Infinity War, there will be something fresh and new.76/100 B",Avengers: Age of Ultron,2395427
84,erkucz00,Great Movie. Why the Hate?,10/10,4 May 2015,"Like an idiot, I took what I read on the internet about this movie to be true. I went to the theater with rather low expectations, only to have my mind blown by the cinematic masterpiece that was Avengers: Age of Ultron.For starters, the acting was great. The Avengers were great as usual, and Jeremy Renner showed a different side of Clint Barton. And then there's Ultron, played by James Spader. I knew he'd be good, but my word! Someone give that man an Oscar! Even with the CGI motion capture, Ultron's character was at the same time incredibly robotic, and amazingly human. As a side note, Andy Serkis also did very well as klaw, despite the fact he only had a few scenes. There's also the thing that most people went to the theater to see. The action scenes. All of the avengers powers were well showcased. Especially Quicksilver's in the slo-mo parts. The battles were filled with numerous ""Holy Crap!"" moments. If you stumble upon the message board post calling the fighting predictable, ignore it.Ultimately, this was a fun movie. Don't get me wrong, I love a good Nolan film, and the daredevil show is one of my faveorites, but thismovie was just fun to watch. It's 2.5 hour run time wasn't exhausting, and the playful humor never got old. If you are looking for a gritty, pulpy film full of mystery and political intruigue, this isn't for you. However, if you want a well made film that captures the spirit of the avengers comics, and leaves you feeling satisfied, this is for you.",Avengers: Age of Ultron,2395427
85,Giacomo_De_Bello,8.5/10,7/10,22 April 2015,"So many things to get out there, but before starting let me just give a disclaimer. I do not remember a time in my life where I wasn't reading Marvel Comics, that is totally true. I am a Marvel Comics geek and The Avengers have been, alongside the Cosmic comics, my favorite series to read and have brought some of the best stories I have ever had the pleasure to enjoy. So when judging a Marvel film there are always two sides of me that are adding up to the final judgment: one side is the film nerd that just wants to get a great movie, the other is the comic nerd that wants his favorite characters to have the best portrayal on screen. That whole introduction might have gone on for two pages, but it was to say I might go into some nerdy territory that general film goers don't care about, but I just can't help it.As you guessed from my score I liked the movie and upon second viewing I will go as far as actually loving it. One thing that I want to get out first is that for the first time, since 2008's ""Iron Man"", I finally saw the MCU coming into it's own. Every movie before was always trying to find it's place in with the other movies, but finally I saw the MCU as I had dreamed of it. It was just like in the comics and I truly loved that, it takes all the mythology and gives it for granted and throws you right into it. There is no need to set-up things, it nailed the feeling of a comic book even more than the first one.""Age of Ultron"" excels on so many levels it is very difficult to start with one because you are immediately thrown into talking about another. I'll start with what I thought was the best part: the characters. Joss Wheodn proves again he understands these characters more than anybody else and makes the very best out of them. There are many, many character moments that are gold and the best are the intimate ones. My favorite parts really were watching the characters interact and argue, the writing value of some scenes was really remarkable. Moreover it is great to see them having grown and knowing each other, it offered a new dynamic that made things all the more enjoyable and again so close to the comic books. Obviously the action sequences are absolutely stunning. My favorite being the very opening one: the film opens with a long shot that had my mouth dropped to the floor and fortunately these breathtaking shots continue throughout the film. Scene after scene I was glued to my seat because of the relentlessness of the visually fantastic action that was always in service of story. It was so brilliantly put together: the vision of the director is so clearly brought to the screen; the complexity of the scenes is so deep, I truly admire the talent of the filmmakers in bringing them to life. The comedy moments obviously work and are juxtaposed to some even better dramatic moments. Plus, as a comic nerd, I lost count of moments where I just geeked out in joy. Overall, this was simply a fabulous ride that never left me time to catch my breath and actually improved on second viewing.All of the negatives are minor things, there isn't one gaping flaw, but when added up they simply don't match the flawlessness of the first one, which is one of my favourite movies of all time. Firstly, Ultron was underwhelming. It pains my fingers to type it, but it is true. Ultron is one of the best villains in history probably, forget Skynet, Ultron is the incarnation of AI gone wrong and is one of the most compelling villains to read about especially the relation with his creator (which by the way I am really bummed isn't Hank Pym because of what it means to that character), but these aspects were never explored and his motivations were really underdeveloped. He wasn't simply given the portrayal he deserves. He was a kind of cool villain, but he wasn't Ultron to me. The storytelling overall wasn't as flawless as in its predecessor, it was very good, but it left bits and pieces behind. The CGI some very rare times popped out. The action was sometimes sloppy and too fast cutting, for the majority it really stands tall, but there were moments here and there were it wasn't as good as it could have been. Moreover, the film just doesn't take risks, there are no major surprises and so it simply doesn't up the stake as much as I wanted to. Now this is really bragging but here are two pet peeves of mine: firstly, I just missed the Seamus McGarvey cinematography, Ben Davis was great don't get me wrong just look above to find my praises of the visuals in this film, but I just missed the what McGarvey is able to do, that being making every single frame immaculate, with Davis there was that shot once in a while that just fell flat. The second pet peeve is something that really bothered me, they tease and tease the Avengers theme throughout, but it never plays! And even worst it plays during the credits! That was really something that missed for me, it gave a great push at the very end, but it was simply too late.Enough nitpicking, I really, really recommend this film to anybody, nerd or not, I genuinely had a riveting experience for the whole duration and that isn't something that many movies do to me. Yes there are many negatives that can be pointed out, but there is just so much to be enjoyed and loved that as much as you can think back to the negatives the better parts will stick out much more.",Avengers: Age of Ultron,2395427
86,davidjr2008,Amazing movie ! (No spoilers),10/10,5 May 2015,"I was reading some of the post and seemed very surprised at the few low ratings , I know you can't please everyone. All of the fighting scenes were spectacular I never got bored , even through the slower parts I enjoyed the whole movie. I think that the humor in it was great , and realistic . You get that much testosterone in a group everyone will try to one up everyone else, In real life as well. I saw it in iMax(the huge screens) 3D , so that definitely added to the excitement , I don't go see movies any more in regular screen ever since imax 3D. I strongly recommend going to see it like that ! It is an unforgettable experience. Also on a side note guys that get disappointed I don't feel bad for because just like with everything in life if you expect something a certain way and it doesn't meet your expectations you are going to get let down ! But if you have none or at the very least lower your expectations you will see how much of a difference it is . Go in with an open mind , don't be so closed minded people. Just saying !

87,vistheindian,Everything you wanted it to be,9/10,22 April 2015,"Quickie Review:The Avengers are now a fully functioning team stopping other groups who have nefarious agendas. On one of their missions, Tony (Robert Downey Jr.) comes across a dormant peacekeeping program. When activated the program named Ultron (James Spader) sees only one solution to achieve peace, human extinction. One of the most highly anticipated movies of the year, Avengers: Age of Ultron has a lot to live up to, and it achieves it in spades. This is not a shallow action film, it is a direct sequel to the first Avengers continuing the story of the team and their relationships. Ultron posed a formidable threat to our heroes, and he did it with confidence and attitude. Avengers AOU is an action-packed, funny, geek out inducing, and most importantly an all-out fun movie that you will want to see multiple times.Full Review:I've been looking forward to this movie not for days, weeks, or months. No, I've been waiting for years. So much so that I went for the midnight premiere on a working day. My expectations were sky- high and wow I left the cinema ecstatic and with a giant smile on my face.Right from the start we kick off with an amazing action scene showing the whole Avengers team taking on the bad guys. I was covered in nerd goosebumps. It shouldn't be a surprise that all the action sequences were top notch. In fact, they are better than the first Avengers because you get to see more of their teamwork. It is exciting to see how they communicate and improvise off of each other's tools and skills. As amazing as these scenes were, the strange thing is they weren't even the best parts of the movie. What I enjoyed the most was the banter between all the characters. The witty dialog had me laughing countless times. I think I can safely say, this was the funniest Marvel movie so far. Yes Avengers AOU is also the darkest film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe but director Joss Whedon always found a way to not let that compromise the fun. A large part of that had to do with the way the characters were handled.These are not the same heroes we knew from Avengers, they have changed, there are new relationships and priorities. All of that brought a new dynamic within the team we hadn't seen before. Everyone, including the new additions such as Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) get their fair share of screen time to shine. Even, Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) was finally shown as a badass. He was integral to keeping the team together when things were at their worst. Now let's talk about the guy who was making Avengers' day worse, Ultron. In the trailers he is shown as a menacing villain with an imposing presence, and that is true physically but his personality was more than that. In many ways he had more base human traits than you might expect: fear, jealousy, anger, and most surprisingly a great sense of humor. He had a great cocky attitude about everything he did, which was a dimension to the character that I didn't anticipate but fit really into the tone of the movie.There is so much more I want to talk about but I want you to experience it all yourself. The vastly overwhelming positives drown out any ""complaints"" I have. Seriously there were moments I couldn't contain myself from cheering and I was not alone in that. So many times the cinema burst into joyous laughter and thunderous applause. Avengers AOU is everything I wanted it to be, more fun, more action, more epicness that make even the most casual viewer's inner nerd come out of the cinema drooling for more.P.S. There is only one mid-credits scene. Once you see that scene you can leave the cinema knowing you are not missing anything.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",Avengers: Age of Ultron,2395427
88,Kodymovietalk,Better then the first!,8/10,14 April 2015,"Avengers age of Ultron is by far the best Marvel movie to date. It has all the elements of the first movie, but steps it up in the action, character and dialog. I went into this movie with very unrealistically high expectations. So when I saw this movie, I was very worried but excited. All the cast from the previous Avengers movie all reprise their roles. Robert Downey Juinor was amazing as Ironman. Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth were both great as Captain America and the mighty Thor. Scarlett Johanson was brilliant as Black Widow and was even more bad-ass in this movie, than any of her other films. Her role was substantially bigger this time around. This can also be said about Hawkeye, who's role was way bigger in this movie. In fact, Hawkeye even has some of the best lines and the best action sequences. Mark ruffilo was once again amazing as Hulk and Bruce Banner. The one character that stole the show, would be James Spader. He embodies an evil AI robot perfectly. He can be really calm and yet menacing and sometimes he can be full of rage and anger. Aron Taylor Johnson and Elisibeth Olsin are also a great new edition to the marvel universe. The scarlet Witch character has a big part in the film also.The action has been dialed up and the set pieces are bigger and better. The cgi can seem a little off at times, but other than that, it looks fantastic.The movie also spends time on the relationships and past of some characters, which leads to some great character moments. This is much more emotional, than the first movie. I would defiantly say that this movie is better than the first Avengers Movie!",Avengers: Age of Ultron,2395427
89,StevePulaski,Fizzles when it should pop,6/10,2 May 2015,"The ""Avengers"" films, and the films of Marvel in general, play less like films and more like large-scale business investments that need to churn an unfathomable amount of money (think north of $1.5 billion) to even be considered a success. When film becomes that expensive and driven by finances, to me, it's no longer an act of entertainment but an act of business and a potentially crippling investment. The Marvel brand, in general, while showing no signs of letting up at the box office, has made me weary over the last two years, as I've been straining to find a great deal of satisfaction in most of the two to three superhero films released every year. To call this genre much of a muchness is still shortchanging in how its repetition hurts the individual impact of each of these films for me.Joss Whedon's ""Avengers: Age of Ultron,"" I thought, would be the exception; after disillusionment with ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier,"" ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2,"" and ""Iron Man 3,"" I was hoping I'd emerge from the sequel gleaming with joy as I did with the first film. However, ""Age of Ultron"" doesn't escape the same kind of issues the former films had; familiarity continues to breed contempt, repetitive quips and attempt at humor distract from core character relations, and candy-colored action that undermines the talent at hand.The film concerns the same Avengers team as last time: Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) all assemble once more to make up the beloved superhero team. However, this time, the team needs to find a way to assemble and be strong enough to take down Ultron (James Spader), an artificially intelligent villain who is created through technology to try and erase human extinction. Even with six of them, however, the Avengers find themselves still underpowered in the face of Ultron's immense technological presence. The film concerns their efforts to take down the villain, whilst coming to realize just what their lives and existence means for the face of humanity.The original ""Avengers"" packed in some terrific character relations; it was fascinating to see how all these superheros would interact with one another, constantly trying to one up their peers and stand tall in the face of everything. ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" worked to expand this feature in a sillier way, but still worked on the level of helping us relate to these larger than life figures. One scene in this film, I recall, has these characters interacting at leisure, and it takes place in a lavish penthouse after a party with all of the Avengers attempting to lift Thor's hammer. Whedon goes for the kill with this film, infusing a great deal of action sequences rather than focusing on the graceful character presence that made the first ""Avengers"" so fun. In both that film and ""Guardians,"" we felt like we were hanging out with these heroes; now, we're back to passively observing them at work.With that, it's amazing to see Whedon, who kept the humor in the first ""Avengers"" to a minimum, only pulling it out on certain occasions, usually to great effect, rely so heavily on quips here. It seems nearly every scene has to end with some kind of forced jab or one-liner, especially a desperately unfunny recurring joke made by Captain America in the opening scene about the use of bad language. These kinds of things only distract from what Whedon does well, particularly here, where those things are masked by other, lesser features.For one, Whedon continues to prove, from both a screen writing and directorial standpoint, that he can juggle chaos. Whedon can habdle about five or six things going on in terms of tying them together when the time comes and capturing such chaos as it's unfolding before us. Sometimes, one needs to just sit back in pure awe at the camaraderie occurring before us and marvel at its visual coherency thanks to Whedon's careful hand. In addition, ""The Avengers"" addresses the weaknesses of the team, despite having six superheros working together. The invincibility element of Marvel superheros has continuously been a distracting element for me, with each passing Marvel film, in that I rarely feel a sense of danger for these characters because it seems as if nothing can stop them.In ""Age of Ultron,"" we actually see the Avengers struggle to adequately assemble to take down Ultron, even going as far as to vacationing to a resort in order to further strengthen and develop. This element of questioning just how strong these six heroes are is something that this extended universe needed.""Avengers: Age of Ultron,"" especially for possibly setting forth new standards for blockbusters in terms of budget, gross, and scope, is still an underwhelming experience. For a film so grand in its vision and limitless with its roster, it feels so grounded in routine, Marvel formula, so much so that the end battle treads dangerously close to not only being boring but riddled with the same kind of ""Transformers""-esque excess that, again, could set a dangerous precedent. Whedon must be admired here, mainly for his craft at handling a great deal of things going on in unison along with his efforts to question the Avengers' invincibility, but considering this is time when the series should take off in the way of ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" the fact that it wobbles and fizzles in impact is a tad frightening.",Avengers: Age of Ultron,2395427
90,dakotadickenson-83457,The most average of all the Avenger films,8/10,26 April 2023,"Avengers: Age of Ultron was a huge deal when it came out, because it was the next step for what the future of the MCU holds. After the fall of S. H. I. E. L. D. And classified documents are released to the world, the Avengers reunite once more to take down a Hydra base and retrieve Loki's scepter. When Tony Stark and Bruce Banner decide to use the scepters energy to launch the Ultron program that would become a peacemaker for the world that would put a end to anymore outside threats, it's discovered that Ultron has a mind of his own that's set on human extinction and it's up to the Avengers to put a end to Ultron's terror while battling demons of their own. What I love the most about this Avengers film, is that we get that actual Avengers vibe and moments throughout the film of them just being together bonding instead of them just battling against Ultron. Robert Downey Jr is fantastic as always as Tony Stark/Iron Man. Chris Hemsworth is magnificent as Thor. Chris Evans is great as Steve Rogers/Captain America. Mark Ruffalo brings his A game as Bruce Banner/Hulk in this film. Scarlett Johansson is stunning as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow. Jeremy Renner is brilliant as always as Clint Barton/Hawkeye. The newcomers Aaron-Taylor Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen as Pietro and Wanda Maximoff were my favorite of the new cast members of the whole film and helped make the film as great as it is. James Spader as Ultron himself I thought was a great casting choice to portray the character. My only problem I really have is not with him or his portrayal, but in all the promotions for this film made him out to be more menacing than he actually ended up being, but other than that, he was a good villain. The character I was most glad to see come to the MCU in this film is Paul Bettany's J. A. R. V. I. S./Vision. After being in the MCU as the voice J. A. R. V. I. S. since Iron Man (2008), it was really great to see him actually come to the big screen and into the MCU. Other cast member such as Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury, Anthony Mackie's Falcon, Don Cheadle's Rhodey/War Machine, and Cobie Smulders Maria Hill were also great additions to the film although I felt each character was definitely underused a bit. I loved the chemistry between Bruce Banner/Hulk and Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow throughout the film and I really wished we would of gotten more of them together. I was also glad to get to know a little more about Clint Barton/Hawkeye too. The sibling relationship between Pietro and Wanda Maximoff was great, but I felt they didn't show as much as they could of. Overall, Avengers: Age of Ultron is thrilling, fun, visually stunning, and action packed from beginning to end while also looking forward for what's to come to the MCU. Rating 8/10.",Avengers: Age of Ultron,2395427
91,natygance,Age of Ultron: AWESOME,10/10,23 April 2015,"So..Let me start off by saying that,being a huge fan of Avengers and its first movie, I was nervous. Nervous because I wasn't sure about the Twins, whether I would like them or not, and because the first movie was so great that it was hard to picture a better one. Well..I was wrong!!so wrong. This movie is one of those you need to see more than once. The characters are,as usual,amazing, but they've evolved since Avengers and are much,much better. In Avengers it felt that some members of the team were more important than others, in this movie they're all equally awesome in their own ways. The action..THE ACTION, from beginning to end is non-stop, the movie begins and ends with action scenes,one better than the previous one. And lastly, the comic reliefs, I remember laughing plenty in Avengers but in this movie it's one joke after the other and they're all awesome! There were some people who complained about all the sneak peaks,saying that it showed too much, let me tell you,you will encounter a lot of things in the movie that you probably weren't expecting, in a good way. One piece of advice: What Whedon said is true, there is no after- credit scene(I stayed till the end just to be sure)but there is one AMAZING mid- credit scene. So,grab your popcorn and enjoy what will most likely be the best movie of the year!I plan to rewatch it many times.",Avengers: Age of Ultron,2395427
92,ArchonCinemaReviews,Weakest Marvel film of the series,6/10,2 May 2015,"There was bound to be a time when the masters at Marvel would make a misstep and Avengers: Age of Ultron is that disappointing moment.We at Archon Reviews like to keep our reviews as ""clean"" as possible. Avengers: Age of Ultron leads us to be forced to utilize a term that breaks that rule. Joss Whedon's Age of Ultron is a clusterf#$k of massive proportions.It was inevitable, and Age of Ultron is proof that even the minds at Marvel Entertainment are not perfect. And Joss Whedon most of all, bites off significantly more than he can handle.As a story, Age of Ultron feels light years ahead of where the previous Marvel films left off, like a horror movie on its eighth installment. Age of Ultron's plot is convoluted and the entire film lacks the structure of a story with intent that propels itself into being made into a film.We propel forward to a time when Tony Stark has jump started a peacekeeping programming using androids and state of the art computer programming. Then we jump forward again as the group known as the Avengers realize an entity in the form of Stark's unintentionally created Artificial Intelligence seeks to malevolently target Earth. Of course, our superheros will fight with everything they have to save the world.Everything about Age of Ultron is forced. From the unnecessarily complicated, multi-layered story, the side characters and the newly manufactured characters that nonchalantly get introduced. Age of Ultron feels dull and lifeless, a blockbuster to cash in on the Marvel name. This fate is completely unlike the caliber of material we Marvel fans are accustomed to and typically resigned to Michael Bay concoctions. Marvel: you are better than this.Age of Ultron is tired and even the actors appear to have difficulty uttering the dialogue. Those familiar faces from the previous films still do an adequate job but newcomers like Elizabeth Olsen and Aaron Taylor-Johnson are laughably inferior. Both the acting, diction and casting director should be fired from the next Avengers film, if there even is one. There are comedic moments in the film, but unlike the initial Avengers film, feel gimmicky and are painfully overused.I understand that at this point in the Marvel franchise, the filmmakers had a huge task in front of them. Unfortunately, they fail and the film produced for Marvel lovers is a disappointment. And this is not coming from the vapid whining of a superfan.Please check out our website for full reviews of all the recent releases.",Avengers: Age of Ultron,2395427
93,richenstony,Ultron was a stand up comic,7/10,23 April 2015,"Got back from a midnight release this morning , and i didn't want to review the film straight away as i wanted it to sink in to brain. Having said that my opinion hasn't really changed as much as i would of liked it to.Joss whedon , in a lot of ways has pretty much lied to the audience about his own film , its not overall shocking someone trying to promote the film by setting up a few custom truths , but i think the fans deserved better from him , so lets start with a few bullet points.1: Ultron in the terms of evil robots go , is up there with a more heavily depressed WALL-E , hes way way to slapstick for a super villain in this , this was supposed to be dark and tonight i saw the Disney side to things.2: Romanov is a nice character but who ever agreed with Wheadon to make her a main character or the center of attention for this blockbuster was out of their depth , giving romanov a more visual back story is fine , but the romantic element with banner and herself was again Disney's BEAUTY AND THE BEAST. Romanov would never let feelings get in the way of THE JOB.3: Hulk little to no screen time , really frustrating this having just brought my hand hulk cup ready to cheer the green bastard on to smash! I think i timed it at 20 minutes probably less! Banner spends to much time moaning about hulks destruction and not about going bananas and helping , you would think now he has some control over being the hulk and being Bruce banner he would be happy to get angry! He knew scarlet witch was messing with his brain and i know bruce is a gentle soul , but hes also smart enough o know when it wasn't his fault!4: This film wasn't set up for civil war , Thor grabbed Tony by the throat , END OF WAR... that was the only act of punishment Tony got for making , LOLtron. And he didn't have a darker side in this film , he was just a lot more impatient to get the ball rolling with protecting the earth. So that was just a big big big let down! In fact the screen time in the first movie with loki's scepter manipulating them all on the boat was more intense than this entire films disagreement with stark and loltron.5: Just another Thanos scene :/ 3 movies , 3 hints. Still no lengthily scene with Thanos in it. I was hoping for a end credit sequence with Phil or spiderman , was that was a bit of let down to.But to sum up , the film does have its good side. It wasn't a complete let down it had parts where i was laughing out loud and also had parts where the action sequences where pretty epic , it deserves no less than a 7 because a lot of work has gone into the movie to make it work and it does work , but it could of worked a lot better :/.",Avengers: Age of Ultron,2395427
