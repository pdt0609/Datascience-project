0,DarkVulcan29,Claflin and Clarke where to perfect,10/10,10 June 2016,"This film is getting mixed reviews, but I really enjoyed it. A very bittersweet film that will leave you feeling happy and sad at the same time. I never read the book that which this film is based on. But sometimes movies are never has detailed has the books they are based on.A beautifully well made story, it about Louisa(Emilia Clarke) a 26 year old who finds a job taking care of Will(Sam Claflin) a young billionaire who is permanently confined to wheel chair after an accident two years earlier, the use of his arms and legs are gone. At first Will does not want Louisia there, and she does her best to put up with him. But soon the form quite a friendship, she teaches him to enjoy life again, and he shows her to be adventurous in life. But the question is will this last? I like the chemistry between Claflin and Clarke, at no point it feels forced. I really bought the affection they feel for one another. At times Clarkes performance feels overly cartoonish, but still good in most of it. Claflin is believable, and the question is how would you feel if you where in his shoes. I don't care what the critics say, this was a perfectly well made bittersweet film.",Me Before You,2674426
1,pattypiazza,A Most Beautiful Love Story,10/10,9 September 2016,"At times I feel that humanity has forgotten, or never really knew, what it is to really love someone. Jojo Moyes obviously isn't one of those people. Love isn't the lust we feel at the beginning of a relationship. It's not the thoughtful vision we compile of what the future could be like or how compatible we are. It's not about how financially successful a prospective partner is. It's certainly not all about sex, although it would be hard to come to this conclusion when the media generally plays strongly to that idea. It's the undeniable, overwhelming pull from our hearts that grows only when we really let ourselves care about someone unselfishly.Thank you Jojo for playing this out so beautifully. Thank you Emelia and Sam for either knowing this experience or fabulously, convincingly portraying it on screen. This movie is a treat to watch and a glimpse of what it feels like to be a person who lives their life with a moral conscience, an open mind, a respect for beliefs that are different than yours and a desire to see the best in the world.I feel absolutely cleansed of negativity after watching this and my hope for the world is renewed. A glorious experience!",Me Before You,2674426
2,whitbyscallyred,Clarke is adorable and the critics get it wrong,9/10,3 June 2016,"How can so many people get this this movie wrong, especially the critics? The high point of the film is the performance by Emelia Clarke. She is hair-brained, and scatty, completely adorable and wonderful.The camera-work is gorgeous and the soundtrack is second to none.Lou (Emilia Clarke) gets a job as a carer to a man (William) who is paralyzed more or less from the neck down. A budding friendship/romance develops; and this is 90% a feel good movie.The criticism of the movie that it depicts a life with profound disability as almost worthless is completely mistaken. The movie depicts William's life as worthwhile and precious. It is William's own judgment that his life cannot go on as it is, and that he would prefer to die.With regard to this, the movie does tend to downplay the pain and suffering that William experiences. Instead it focuses on the good times and precious moments he spends will Lou. And as already stated, the character of Lou is completely adorable. I am in love.",Me Before You,2674426
3,ThomasDrufke,Live Boldly,7/10,4 June 2016,"I wouldn't consider myself the target audience for these romantic dramas. In fact, I'm usually turned off by the overabundance of forced clichés and unnecessary plot devices. While Me Before You definitely falls victim to some of those unfortunate young adult tropes, there's far more charm than harm here. The film stars Emilia Clarke (Lou) and Sam Claflin (Will) from Game of Thrones and The Hunger Games respectively. I've enjoyed both of their works in the past and they both make the most of the script that was given to them. Their budding charisma on screen is by far the highlight of the film. It's nice to see Clarke take on a lighter and more exuberant role than she has played in the past as it mirrors her off-screen personality as well. Clarke's likability as Lou is put a test as she has to deal with the stern and far less cheerful, Will, who became paralyzed after a motorcycle accident. If you didn't guess it already, yes they do grow to live with each other's quirks and inconveniences and maybe even share some affection for each other. It's pretty much the basis for all of these romantic novels adapted for film, but if you're film has enough likable qualities to it, the overused plot points and clichés can be forgiven.The main qualm for these characters are Will's questionable wishes about his future living as a quadriplegic and Lou's inability to fulfill her potential and aspirations due to her commitment as the breadwinner for her family. The way Lou effortlessly deals with these issues is what makes her so likable. It's also why you root for her and Will to become romantically involved as the film gives us compelling enough reasons to desire it. With that said, I was pleasantly surprised with how the romance is depicted. Everything is earned and not forced.I think my only real complaints with the film involve its tendency to veer into clichéd territory. I'm not a fan of when romantic films play popular songs that tell you exactly how to feel as an audience member. Or when a certain character is written specifically to give us someone to dislike and is used a plot device more than anything else. On more than one occasion, Me Before You does that. But it's when the film attempts to take an original and realistic spin on the romance that the film really shines. It's because of the ladder that I think Me Before You is definitely worth a look.+Clarke's undeniable likability+Charm and chemistry with the Lou and Will dynamic+Romance is earned not forced-Popular songs tend to ruin the big moments-A few clichéd characters and plot devices7.4/10",Me Before You,2674426
4,dewittambassador,"I don't like sappy movies, but I really liked this sappy movie. Clarke wins again.",9/10,2 July 2016,"Emelia Clarke's work on Game of Thrones is the only reason I watched this movie in the first place. She is occasionally transcendent in that role, where she must keep her eyebrows restrained, and I wanted to see what would happen if her amazingly mobile brows were set free ... free as her dragons.There are a lot of solid things about this movie. The story (of a young woman who cares for a quadriplegic young man) is strong, the direction and cinematography good though not exceptional, the screen writing also good-not-exceptional, the supporting cast (especially Janet McTeer and Charles Dance)and leading man (Sam C.) quite good, and the emotional notes it hits, though all predictable and often a bit overwrought (cue swelling, heartwarming music...), ring true enough for an unabashed romance.So, not really my type of movie. But I am happy to say that I was (almost) completely taken by Clarke's performance. Her character here is nothing like her GoT role, but is in many ways an equally fantasy-based role (but with clumsy shyness and striped leggings instead of fireproof skin and dragons) -- and Clarke manages to pull this character out of romantic fantasy into believability as effectively as she brings to life her role as Mother of Dragons. She has the combination of charisma, physical beauty, character-acting chops, and inner luminosity to pull a fairly nice, 7-of-10 heartwarmer up to a 9-of-10 charmer.",Me Before You,2674426
5,Mamabird67,Adorable!,10/10,4 June 2016,"The movie really was adorable! I knew exactly what to expect since I read the book, but I loved the adaptation. What helps the movie most is that the novelist, Jojo Moyees, wrote her own screenplay. She did a great job transitioning the story from paper to screen. Little things that were left out of the novel weren't really needed to move the story along. Both Emilia Clarke and Sam Clafin were excellent. Her facial expressions were amazing and her insane eyebrows deserve some type of award all on their own. I thoroughly enjoyed the soundtrack as well.Don't listen to critics and go see this movie.

6,gradyharp,'You are pretty much the only thing that makes me wanna get up in the morning.',10/10,4 September 2016,"This film is one of those rare instances where a novel (by JoJo Moyes) is adapted for the screen by the novelist and finds a sensitive director such as Thea Sharrock and the result is a story that could have been sanguine but instead is an enriching emotional journey. To discover this film among all the crime and killing and morbid vampire or other undead creatures stories and overblown CGI comic book/fairy tale adventures is a breath of fresh air.The story takes place in England and in a very subtle way shares an insight between the wealthy and the poor – emphasizing that richness is truly in the spirit rather than the bank account. Lou Clark (Emilia Clarke) knows lots of things. She knows how many footsteps there are between the bus stop and home. She knows she likes working in The Buttered Bun tea shop and she knows she might not love her long-term boyfriend Patrick (Matthew Lewis). Her family (Brendan Coyle, Jenna Coleman, Samantha Spiro and Alan Breck) needs money and insist Lou seek employment when Lou loses her job: it is out of pure fortitude that she finds one - as caretaker of a young wealthy quadriplegic – a job that ultimately keeps her sane. Will Traynor (excellent Sam Claflin) knows his motorcycle accident took away his desire to live. He is supported by his male nurse Nathan (the superb Stephen Peacocke) as well as his loving parents (Janet McTeer and Charles Dance). He knows everything feels very small and rather joyless now and he knows exactly how he's going to put a stop to that – a planned death after fulfilling his parent's plea for a six month reprise. What Will doesn't know is that Lou is about to burst into his world in a riot of color. And neither of them knows they're going to change each other for all time until Lou concocts a bucket list of events that brings light into her life as well as joy into Will's final days.Without becoming morbid, the interplay between Lou and Will is a transformation and due to the splendid script and sensitive direction and a cast of superb actors in every part this little film makes a lasting impression, restoring our faith in what friendship and love can achieve. In short, this is a brilliant little film worthy of at least one watching- if not multiple! Highly recommended.",Me Before You,2674426
7,aimee-837-243757,A sweet love story for those who wants to get lost in the moment.,10/10,4 June 2016,"I admit that I have read the book and so when the movie came out, I just HAD to go see it. So I drag my poor husband and we went to watch a late show that was relatively full. I didn't tell him anything about the movie and I watched him watching it. He actually really enjoyed it. The movie was lovely. The movie itself was beautiful. The scenery was set somewhere is rural England. There are green pastures, a castle and beautiful stone walkways. We first meet Lou, a beautiful,charming, bubbly girly girl who is a strong character but maybe a little too comfortable with her current life and then we have Will. Dashing Will! Sarcastic, funny, a little mean at first. They are world apart but through fate ( and Will disabilities) they met and slowly realize what one possessed, the other needs. Even if they never really knew it. As the movie progress, they falls for each other and we all fall for them. I loved Emily as Lou and Sam as Will. They played their roles perfectly and the chemistry between then was undeniable. I think everyone should go and watch this movie if you love romantic comedy. It is hilarious at times and yet sweet. I assure you that you'll feel every emotion out there with this movie. It's so beautiful. Go watch it and judge yourself. For me, this is an amazingly beautiful love story.",Me Before You,2674426
8,hawkinsk-16422,Please don't take this personally,2/10,25 November 2020,"Coming from the perspective of a disabled person, I hated it. I feel like it's easy for a random Ableist person to watch it and decide that if they were disabled in the way William is that they wouldn't want to live, either, or that their life wouldn't be worth living. But William's life is one worth living and the ending just really disappointed me when he decided it wasn't. I know that that's not how most of the people here interpreted the movie but it just didn't sit well with me. It's not necessarily a Bad Movie, I just personally did not like it.",Me Before You,2674426
9,Doasnow95,Amazing,8/10,3 July 2016,"I loved this movie. It stayed very true to the book and I love the book. I think Emilia Clarke was born to play her. I feel like she was just playing herself cause she has a personality like that in real life. It was pure joy to watch her play Lou. The expressions she makes, the way she talks and most of all, her amazing clothes! I loved every single outfit she wore. This film made me laugh and it made me very emotional, just like the book. I think Sam Claflin was also born to play Will. They had an amazing chemistry throughout the entire film and the rest of the cast is also spot on. There are of course some parts from the book that were left out but nonetheless, this film was still amazing. I also want to point out that the soundtrack of the movie is amazing as well.

10,SnoopyStyle,sappy romance,6/10,18 November 2016,"Louisa ""Lou"" Clark (Emilia Clarke) makes a cup of tea to solve every problem. She's 26, living at home with her mother, unemployed father, senile grandpa, sister Treena (Jenna Coleman), and Treena's son Tom. She loses her waitress job and the family needs her to get another job. Her boyfriend Patrick is more interested in running than interested in her. The Traynors are the rich family in town and the former lords of the castle. Camilla Traynor (Janet McTeer) hires her for six months to assist her paralyzed son Will Traynor (Sam Claflin) who was run over by a motorcycle two years ago. Will is bitter at losing his globe-trotting outgoing lifestyle with his girlfriend Alicia and high-finance friends. He is cold to the quirky Lou at first. Alicia announces that she's getting married to his former best friend. Then Lou overhears Camilla arguing with her husband Stephen (Charles Dance) about Will's plan to get euthanized in Switzerland in six months. Lou struggles to give Will a reason for living as male nurse Nathan helps her to understand his pain.This is a sappy romance. There's nothing wrong with that but it's really uninspired in its execution. The best thing in this movie is Emilia Clarke being allowed to be her natural goofy-grin self. This version of her is really charming and winning. The infuriating part is Will's refusal to live his new life. Nathan explains that Will really tried the first year and that he's hiding his painful existence from Lou. The movie does not do a good job portraying that idea and therefore leaves Will's reasoning bare-thread. They need a scene where Will is actively trying to hide his pain. His reason cannot be a lack of a James Bond lifestyle.",Me Before You,2674426
11,TheOneThatYouWanted,This movie is one of the things wrong with the world today.,1/10,4 July 2016,"So you can tell I'm not a fan of this film just by my title and score. The movie itself is okay at best. Emilia Clarke does a well enough job with the role because the character she is playing is pretty much who she is in real life; in other words, this role didn't require Emilia acting much and that is a good thing because people are slowly figuring out that she has a very limited range when it comes to acting. Towards the end of the movie is when her limited acting range becomes apparent thanks to the crying scenes, most of the scenes she does with tearless crying which help to take you out of the movie. Don't get me wrong, her acting isn't bad until the end when she is forced to show another emotion other than bubbly. I should note the director does an excellent job of hiding a good amount of Emilia's emotional scenes by having her hug someone and then showing mostly the other person's face. I can write a whole book on Emilia's overrated acting chops but I'm not here to do that so let me carry on with this review. If it wasn't for the ending, where we finally learn the real message of the film I would have ranked the film about a 6 out of 10. But halfway into the film we learn the quadriplegic character made a deal with his parents that he will end his life after 6 months. During the film we learn this guy is smart and etc, etc. Someone even points out that he could go back to work if he wanted to but this guy is hell bent on killing himself for the simple reason of which happens to be that he misses his old life so he is giving up on this life. And apparently that is a good enough reason to let the man kill himself. Great message to put out there into the world. We recently lost Muhammad Ali. We all know about Muhammad Ali's condition and we all saw the impact he had on the world both before and in spite of his condition. He fought until the bitter end and became more of a legend because of it. This movie encourages people to take the easy way out. Now, I can understand how depression can play a role in all of this but this character is a pretty boy with a sh!t load of money.. and on top of that he found the love of his life and she is more than ready to be with him forever. But his reasoning is that he would only be a burden on her living her life. So yeah, this movie pretty much matches the materialistic and self- absorbed nature of what these modern times have transformed into. Whatever, the movie is a chick flick at best so I don't care. Apparently suicide isn't frowned upon when a quadriplegic is concerned. Moral of the story, you have nothing to contribute to society once you become paralyzed. Maybe this movie was funded by the government as a way of reducing the cost of people with disabilities on healthcare. Euthanasia for the win! Frankly, a disgusting message and an even more disgusting movie.",Me Before You,2674426
12,anaisverny_ploypailin,Gets me crying Everytime,9/10,14 October 2018,"Cried the first time I watched it. Now it's the 6th time I've seen it ,and I noticed that the more times I watch it, the earlier into the film I cry. Lou's character is so beautiful and so is their relationship, which makes me cry because I know how it ends.Would recommend if you want a good cry, and if you're a fan of Emilia Clarke. She's so cute in this.

13,ferguson-6,for the hanky-loving crowd,5/10,3 June 2016,"Greetings again from the darkness. Who doesn't enjoy a good cry in a dark movie theatre? The first feature film from director Thea Sharrock is taken directly from the tear-jerker novel by Jojo Meyes (who also wrote the screenplay). Although I try to avoid using the term very often, it's very much a by-the-numbers chick flick  complete with the heart-of-gold working class girl trying her best to ""save"" the handsome rich guy to whom life has dealt a tough hand. For fans of the book and the genre, it should deliver the desired effect  the studio even provided movie logo tissues for the screening.For most of us, the effectiveness of this type of movie comes down to the characters. Luisa is the effervescent working class girl hired as a personal assistant to the extremely wealthy quadriplegic Will Traynor. Emilia Clarke (""Game of Thrones"") does everything in her power to make us (and Will Traynor) like Luisa. To describe her as optimistic is like saying Eric Clapton can play guitar. Calling her perky would be like saying Donald Trump has hair. Both statements are true, but hardly capture the totality of reality. In stark contrast, Sam Claflin (The Hunger Games: Mockingjay) purposefully underplays Will  the one time cliff-diving, James Bond birthday video type now confined to a wheelchair.Lu is a constant toothy smile complemented by expressive and active eyebrows that somehow overshadow her chatty bedside manner, and kaleidoscopic and geometric clothes and shoes  all encompassed with an ever-bouncy step that would make Tigger envious. Lu mostly shares the screen with Will and the personal nurse and therapist Nathan, played by Stephen Peacocke. The camera certainly loves all three of these faces, and director Sharrock wisely adds Janet McTeer and Charles Dance as Will's parents. They bring a regal presence to what otherwise could have played a bit too cutesy.Despite the heavy dose of ""awww"", the story deserves credit for touching on the ""right to die"" or ""dying with dignity"" debate. While those closest to Will selfishly proclaim they don't understand his plan to head to Switzerland, it's Nathan who says it best  'who am I to judge'. While a full on discussion of the topic would be out of place here, the film does a nice job of not shying away from the process.Other recognizable faces in the cast include Jenna Coleman (""Doctor Who"") as Lu's sister and confidante, and Matthew Lewis (Harry Potter series) as Lu's fitness freak boyfriend who isn't very understanding  of either Lu or her job. There's also an odd but welcome wedding cameo from Joanna Lumley. My biggest issue with the story is that I just never understood how or when Lu fell so deeply in love with Will. Sure, I get the appeal of the castle, the concertos, and the tropical vacations, but where was the real personal connection? Was it simply that she thought she could charm Will into changing his mind on the big decision? That's not really love. Another piece that's difficult to take  the numerous musical interludes seemingly designed to make sure viewers are in the proper state of melancholy. There was another segment that I found not just ironic, but actually annoying; however, discussion of the ""Live boldly"" advice would give away the film's ending  something I'm not sure even matters since it's made pretty clear throughout, but it still goes against my movie code.",Me Before You,2674426
14,hdavis-29,"Hokey, manipulative and overdone",2/10,5 June 2016,"Don't get me wrong. I like a weepy, romantic chick-flick as much as the next guy. But this one is so manipulative and over-the-top that I felt myself getting hostile about a third the way through. It took self-control not to make rude comments at the screen.Part of the problem is Emilia Clarke. He character is modeled after the Brigit Jones style of self-consciously, klutzy, heart on her sleeve heroine that holds appeal to many viewers. Clarke's acting is filled with so many facial tics it almost becomes unintentionally comic. If you shaved Ms. Clarke's eyebrows, she'd convey no emotional range. But with them, she'd be a natural silent movie actress. Her eyebrows literally stole every scene they were in.The music, especially the segments used between scenes goes beyond intrusive. It is downright offensive. If a character is about to die and is falling in love, do we really need an overwrought vocalist singing ""Oh poor me, I'm falling in love, yet I'm about to die."" This is like a Greek chorus with one eye on the AM playlist. I'm exaggerating here, but the point is real. We don't need treacly vocal music to mimic what we've just seen. Most of us got it the first time. You need a break between scenes? Instrumental segues would work just fine, thank you.I've given this a ""2"" out of 10. In every way this big budget film deserves a rock bottom ""1"" for its manipulative and overdone approach. I've given it the extra point for the lovely location shooting. At least the castles don't have eyebrows.",Me Before You,2674426
15,cgbarr-73033,"As a caretaker, I hate this movie",1/10,28 December 2022,"I found myself in a very similar situation to the protagonist, accidentally stumbling into the position of someone's personal caretaker and becoming extremely close with that person. I am best friends with my patient now, and we even live together. I liked this part of the movie because I related to it strongly. The job is very intimate and personal, and the relationships you build with both the person you care for and their other caretakers is invaluable. Don't get me wrong, this is a cute movie. But the entire premise is awful.Unfortunately the messaging about physical disabilities in this movie disturbs me. My friend is more disadvantaged than the character in this movie and suffers a great amount of pain. People with disabilities are much more likely to suffer from suicidal thoughts, and I think this movie touched on this distastefully and even glorified suicide. It seems to display being able-bodied as a reality much better than being disabled, and that being disabled makes all the joys of life unfulfilling. Disabled people can be wonderful and feel wonderful, and they should be given the same mental health resources as any other person. I don't think anyone would try to justify an able-bodied person seeking euthanasia. Anyone can suffer from mental illness, and I just hate this movie. It disgusts me, and I hope my best friend never watches this because this would only be harmful to her. This movie is dangerous.",Me Before You,2674426
16,tashlast,Romantic Dramas are often a hit or miss,8/10,4 January 2020,"But this movie brought a very solemn smile and tear to my face when I watched it. I genuinely loved this movie. I had two reasons to go watch it in theaters when it came out. 1.) I love Emilia's performance in GOT and wanted to check this out. 2.) I have been needing to drag my boyfriend out to watch it with me.In the end , Clarke and Claflin have great chemistry, and my heart truly broke when the movie was coming to an end. Most people who hated this movie have told me ""Oh, it promotes the suicide of the disabled,"" but that isn't true. I have a friend who is disabled. Paraplegic, and she basically lives in her wheelchair except when she needs assistance to get to other places. I wanted to get her view on it, so I took her to watch the movie 2 weeks later. When the movie finished she was in tears. She gave me a pat on my lap and asked for a hug and whispered ""Thank you"" into my ears. She is a huge sap for romance movies, she explained how it was touching that a movie was touching on the idea of people on life support who find it a struggle to survive. She said that yes, it was unfortunate that William wanted to end his life, it made her happy to see that he was cared for by person who loved him and he didn't die in vain, but with a sense of fulfillment.Maybe it might send mixed messages, but hearing firsthand from a friend who basically told she knows what its like to be William that this movie wasn't insulting to her made me happy and brought a tear to my eye. Humanity is failing to know what love truly means. People tend to go the looks, wealth and lust in relationship at first, but we forget the friendship, the bond and company that love brings, which is why so many relationships fail nowadays. And this movie shows that everyone is deserving of a chance to love. Even the more challenged people are deserving of love. This movie sends a lovely sentiment, and I am glad I saw this movie.",Me Before You,2674426
17,W011y4m5,Vile.,1/10,13 August 2021,"As a guy with a disability, this movie genuinely appalled me with its tone deaf portrayals, considering the basic premise reads as ""bitter disabled guy is extremely bitter about being disabled because now his life is worthless & no longer worth living... Until he finds an able bodied saviour to rely upon in order to make him happy.""Like, you know what... Can we please cut the crap & desist depicting individuals with disabilities as dependent? We're not broken & we don't require fixing, both emotionally or physically. We should be allowed to exist without out of touch celebrities sensationalising our lives in some voyeuristic, perverse feature length project that was CLEARLY created by people who didn't bother to do any research. Thus, they carelessly play in to harmful stereotypes, passing off blatant discrimination / offensive lines of dialogue as ""harmless banter"".Maybe it is to them but other men & women in the real world have to live with the consequences of this shambolic, shamelessly ill informed, ableist propaganda... So the fact that they're evidently unbothered only reaffirms the observable conclusion that they're very privileged & thus, since they don't personally experience the ramifications caused by inadequate representation, they're manifestly ill suited to the task of tackling it properly.I'd go in to further detail but quite frankly, other contributors have already articulated the problems far more coherently than I ever could & the film's not worth my time, nor the investment of energy.Shame on Emilia Clarke, Sam Claflin, Jenna Coleman, Charles Dance, Dianne Morgan, Joanna Lumley etc. For partaking in this crap-fest of infuriating ignorance. Disappointed to see them endorse such an insulting message with their involvement. Do better, because this is disgustingly negative representation.P. S. Even the filmmaking's indefensibly bad - it looks humiliatingly cheap - as though the production's been shot on an old iPhone found at the bottom of an abandoned skip.",Me Before You,2674426
18,jbam_46,It was a pretty cute,7/10,1 June 2016,"Felt very derivative of Intouchables I did however really enjoy the romance that was in this film.Emilia Clark has the most expressive face I have ever seen on camera.Watch her eyebrows! That's all I have to say. You could almost watch this entire movie just staring at her eyebrows I had a hard time not doing that.I really enjoyed her character. She is a silly, eccentric, perpetually happy girl. With a pretty eclectic sense of style.Emilia Clarke was perfectly cast for this role.She ventures far from her intense power house character the Mother of Dragons from Game of Thrones.At times it was hard to tell if Emilia Clarke the actress is just extremely expressive with her face, or if it was something she was doing for the role which I suppose speaks to how well she did.Because I'm thinking she was exaggerating it, therefore she played the part marvellously.The male lead is Sam Claflin, who you will more than likely recognize but not be able to place. His largest role as of late is the water proficient fighter from the Hunger Games.I also feel he played the part very well. No complaints, He has a great smile, or smirk, that he does through out, which allows us to empathize with him a little more when he seeming unlikable.There are a lot of light moments, actually the whole movie has a very light tone to it it's a serious topic, but with Clarke's character it's hard for anything to be too serious or solemn. There are those sombre moments, which is, I'm sure, why I was given a tissue box at the advance screening.There were only a few editing aspects I didn't enjoy. There were far too many cuts in certain scenes Emilia walking up to the mansion for the first time and her conversation on the bench with her boyfriend. They were distracting. This was sprinkled throughout the film to greater or lesser degrees.I think the film looked pretty, great locations. And a wonderful set, really. The house Claflin's character lives in looks very nice. I loved all the walls that opened when pushed on. Very modern, and expensive I'm sure.There is a little treat for any Harry Potter fans! Neville Longbottom, all grown up and looking fit, he plays the part of Emilia Clarke's boyfriend. I hope to see him in more roles, maybe even a lead one day.As for family friendliness, this movie is a G, it is good to go. In the opening scene Claflin is presumably being intimate with his girlfriend, they are obviously naked, but nothing is shown, they are under sheets.There is no cursing or obscenities in this movie worth mentioning.",Me Before You,2674426
19,emixam-28961,"The Tear-Jerking ""Me Before You"": Reminding Ourselves of Living Boldly!",10/10,2 June 2016,"Thea Sharrock's film adaptation of Jojo Moyes's ""Me Before You"" is one of those hidden gems, which we should all watch rather early than later. First, the talented British cast is impressive. Emilia Clarke, Sam Claflin, Janet McTeer, Charles Dance, Matthew Lewis, just to name a few, beautifully create an emotional journey, which is more than just a heart-breaking love story. Challenging our life perspectives every step of the way, these actors invite us to live boldly and seize the opportunities passing by. Louisa Clarke (Emilia Clarke), a naive 26-year old English woman, lives in a peaceful village where nothing seems to be happening. Supporting her whole family financially, Lou has a dull life working hard without ever leaving our native city. When she loses her job at Buttered Bun Cafe, her world is turned upside down. Desperately looking for a new job, she goes to the local job center and is proposed to work for a despicable 30ish-year old quadriplegic man called Will Traynor. His desire not to get help makes him look miserable and frustrated. However, with time, Lou pierces his shell and unveils Will's true colors. She starts showing him how great his life could be. But one revelation changes their relationship forever.Best known for his roles as Finnick Odair in ""The Hunger Games"" series, Sam Claflin's portrayal of Will is exquisite. It is almost inconceivable to imagine him not being a part of this movie. The physical and psychological challenge of playing a quadriplegic man, who needs to feel like a man again, elevates the English-born actor to Hollywood's acting A-list. In ""Me Before You"", Claflin convinces us that words are way more impactful than being good looking. Through his presence on the screen, Claflin inhabits one of the most powerful quotes of Jojo Moyes's original story, ""You only get one life. It is actually your duty to live it as fully as possible"". Playing opposite Claflin, Emilia Clarke (""Game of Thrones"") shines through with her naivety and authentic, clumsy attitude on the screen. Her unique facial expression, while crying and laughing, makes us fall even more for the quirky, innocent Lou. No one could have ever filled the role better than the Mother of Dragons herself. Emilia Clarke is LOU CLARKE! From her crazy outfits in the movie to her charming personality, Clarke has it all. ""Me Before You"" will be the catalyst in her career, so let's be ready to see some more of this bumble bee.On a final note, we should be grateful to Jojo Moyes for questioning us on the reality of assisted suicide and physical disabilities.There are not lots of writers who have been able to make such a statement and shake the status quo when it comes to life and death, but Moyes did it beautifully. The only thing left to say is: GO WATCH this movie! You will not regret it! It will make laugh, cry, but most importantly push you to embrace life fully!P.S. Bring with you some tissues! You might need them!",Me Before You,2674426
20,claudio_carvalho,Adorable Dramatic Romance,8/10,9 May 2018,"The twenty-six year-old waitress of a cafe Louisa ""Lou"" Clark (Emilia Clarke) is a charming woman that lives with her parents Bernard (Brendan Coyle) and Josie Clark (Samantha Spiro), her sister Katrina ""Treena"" Clark (Jenna Coleman) and her grandfather (Alan Breck) in a small town in the United Kingdom. Lou supports the whole family since Bernard is unemployed and Treena is a student. When she loses her job, she applies to the position of caregiver of the wealthy banker Will Traynor (Sam Claflin), who was hit by a motorcycle two years ago and became tetraplegic. Will´s mother Camilla Traynor (Janet McTeer), supported by her husband Stephen Traynor (Charles Dance), hires the unexperienced but happy Lou to take care of her son together with his nurse Nathan (Stephen Peacocke). When Lou meets Will, she finds a bitter, cynical and depressed young man that had lost the will to live. Further, she learns that the handsome Will was a successful athlete and banker. Will she lift his spirit? ""Me Before You"" is an adorable dramatic romance in the directorial debut of director Thea Sharrock. The central subject, euthanasia, is not discussed but it is easy to understand Will´s attitude based on his athletic and sexual performances before the accident. The chemistry of Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin and the beautiful locations in the United Kingdom are enough to grant a wonderful entertainment. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Como Eu Era Antes de Você"" (""How I Was Before You"")",Me Before You,2674426

The music is well chosen and the acting is good and there were some very touching moments that will make the audience who didn't watch yet cry. Lou is a funny young woman who wants to live a simple life, who wants to wear clothes and be fashionable in her own way. The paralyzed man is a damaged cause looking for hope. Both these characters are very different, yes they pick things from each other and they put smiles on each others faces. A couple that wouldn't get bored giving and taking to their souls.. Maybe, when it comes to believing in love unconditionally, Faith is hope then. Live the life as it faces you then. In health and sickness. In the sweetest moments and bitterest ones. Just live your life No matter what happens to you. Always get back and fight to survive and be alive. That is what this movie is all about...

24,mmbudny,Thoroughly enjoyed the movie,8/10,5 September 2016,"All movies can be scrutinized for faults, as some reviewers have done, but if the movie makes a mark, then those faults really don't matter, do they? I found the ""angry"" Will Traynor not completely believable, not like the anti-social Jack Nicholson in As Good As It Gets, but Sam Clafin did well with his transformation. Emilia Clarke was absolutely wonderful and I will be on the lookout for other roles she has taken and will undertake in the future. Kudos also to the characters who played Will's parents, Janet McTeer and Charles Dance. Two thumbs up for the movie. Am seriously considering whether the movie ought to bump another movie off my favorite 50 relationship movie list.

25,paulgwilliams,Sets back perceptions of disability by decades,1/10,16 June 2016,"This film, and presumably the book on which it is based, commits a triple whammy. First, it portrays disabled people as miserable. Second it perpetuates the idea that they need rescuing by a vivacious non- disabled youngster. Third it presents disabled people as still so miserable, despite being 'rescued', that they have to go to Switzerland to be euthanased. Prince Harry must be tearing his hair out after all his efforts with the Invicta Games to portray disabled people positively. The film is nothing more than propaganda for the really dangerous Swiss death machine Dignitas. It is ghastly and should be banned.",Me Before You,2674426

An author's expression, the director's creativity, the performer's charisma and the captivating music can embrace a person and touch some of those primal feelings, hidden deep within vaults in our heart. At its base is a very simple story requiring some astounding performances to make it come to life. The film focuses on the feelings of innocence, simplicity, commitment, loyalty and love. How true are you with the people around you? Will you stick around at a trying time of another's life? The film makes you dwell on the unpredictability of life. In a moment, everything can change and maybe in a way which is not possible for us to bear.A truly magnificent piece of cinema.

If you're into romance just as much as I am, then this would definitely be a priority to watch this movie before you die. Maybe an overstatement but I am SO glad that I watched this. It's one of those good girl tried to save the ""broken"" guy type of plots but this one by far, has to be one of the most well directed and heartwarming movies out there in the movie industry. Titanic is my favorite movie and this definitely comes a close second. Not many romance movies make me tear up but this one had me sobbing into my blankets. Overall, just watch the darn movie. It's amazing for all the right reasons.

28,bob-the-movie-man,"""You are scored on my heart Clark""",7/10,4 October 2016,"""Me Before You"" is a bit of a queer fish of a movie. It never quite decides whether it wants to be a romantic weepy, a drama, or a rom- com and as such ends up rather falling between all three stools.Emelia Clarke (""Game of Thrones"", ""Terminator: Genesys"") plays Lou Clark, an 'invisible' plain girl ""with potential"" who is trapped – due to unemployment-led poverty - living with her parents in a provincial castle town (a picturesque Pembroke, though notably hardly a Welsh accent in earshot). Her boyfriend Patrick (""Harry Potter""'s Matthew Lewis) is a running nut that doesn't play to her romantic needs in any way. Circumstances lead her into the job of a carer for a quadriplegic, Will Traynor (Sam Claflin, from ""The Hunger Games"" sequels) who also happens to be the son of the local millionaire couple (played by Charles Dance and Janet McTeer). They own the castle, a large mansion and most of the surrounding countryside too.Will – previously a sports jock - is paralyzed from the neck down after an accident and is a frustrated and suicidal mind in a useless body. Can the quirky and vivacious Lou bring him out of his morbid shell and find him a life worth living again?From this outline, you might think the story almost writes itself, and for most of the film it does. But the writers have a number of twists and turns in store which – depending on your sentiments – might entertain or appall.As her first leading actress role in a non-action feature it's a bit difficult to sum up Emilia Clarke's performance. At face value it could be described as an advanced case of over-acting, with an extensive array of kooky looks and gurning facial expressions. On the other hand, she does it all with such vivacity and charm - and notably in a manner so in keeping with the character she portrays - that it is hard not to be enchanted by her: I certainly was.Claflin plays the brooding and resentful Traynor well and Matthew Lewis shows he is growing into a really professional jobbing actor as he enters his mid-20's.Also radiant (she always is sorry to break it to the wife like this... but I am basically in love with her!!) is the ever-gorgeous Jenna Coleman (""Dr Who"", ""Victoria"") in what is to date a rare outing for her onto the big screen (she previously has only had a small role in the first ""Captain America"" film). Coleman and Clarke make a very credible pair of sisters, with the ""bed"" discussion scene being very touching.Elsewhere a number of other well-known faces crop up including Brendan Coyle (""Downton Abbey"") as Lou's father and Joanna Lumley as a wedding guest with a handy line in references.The soundtrack by Craig (""Love Actually"") Armstrong is top notch with pleasing songs from Ed Sheeran, Imagine Dragons, Cloves and We The Kings.The production quality is as professional as you would expect from a British-made movie, although the Mallorca and Paris locations are not particularly well exploited, since for a large chunk of these scenes I was convinced they hadn't left Pinewood!So, a bit of a mixed bag, but enjoyable nonetheless. A guilty pleasure. If you like a romantic piece of escapism this is one for a wet Sunday afternoon, provided you have a box of tissues handy.

29,dandebs,A hate story,1/10,8 August 2017,"If you are disabled, kill yourself. That's the message of the movie, packaged in a ""love"" story. It's just another attempt to undermine the sanctity of life and normalise euthanasia. Horrific. Real love sometimes means saying ""no"" to people when they're wrong. Allowing someone to commit suicide just because they are disabled is not love. Disabled people aren't second-class citizens. They are people!",Me Before You,2674426

I realize you should watch a film before reviewing it but I honestly don't see how anything in the story could make the finale okay. I cannot fathom why so many people loved this film and say it is about loving and living against all odds. The male lead found love but then kills himself anyway. This is the exact opposite of living life despite obstacles. The message of this story seems to be that life is not worth living if you are paralyzed and you should kill yourself to save yourself and people who love you from agony. This a cruel, horrific, dangerous message.",Me Before You,2674426
31,cekadah,A nice little 3 hanky tear jerker with a very abominable message,7/10,3 July 2016,"If the director of a movie has stirred an emotion in a viewer does that make it a good movie? I think 'yes' because the viewer has been touched within and the story connected with that person, on some level. Unfortunately for Director: Thea Sharrock and Writer: Jojo Moyes the emotional connection for this viewer (me) was negative and borderline angry. But the movie is a good 6 or 7 stars worth to me because I found it well scripted, acted and photographed.The plot is so British class oriented I was gritting my teeth. We have Will Traynor an upper crust society rich boy who is able to afford any indulgence he so desires. He lives in a mansion and owns an ancestral castle. Has had top line education and was a multi-talented sportsman and is exceptionally handsome. Mr upper crust Will is arrogant, self centered, and oh so superior. Then there is Lou Clark a working class former shop girl living in a small bungalow with her family. Her father is currently unemployed and cannot find a job. The family depends on Lou's income to make ends meet. She looses her shop job and applies as a companion aide to the now disabled (quadriplegic) Will Traynor. His mother is so charmed by Miss shop girl Lou's cheerful and quirky attitude she hires her. So there's the first problem - a working class person having to survive by being 'in service' to an upper society family. What a good little Brit she is! And of course the Traynor's feel it's their duty to provide for the lower classes so they hire Lou's father as a 'castle facility technician' - read 'grounds keeper for the castle'! Then there is the ever available Nathan who supplies the muscle to move Will from bed to chair and back, plus keep account of Will's borderline health. It's never explained how Nathan is always - on call! Can't keep the 'superiors of society' waiting!The title ""Me Before You"" is also an issue with this viewer! We are never given a definition of this title. Which of the two main characters is 'Me' and which is 'You'! Think about it ... as the relationship between Will & Lou warms up the easy answer is Will as the 'Me' because of his death wish and to hell with the now close emotional bond between Will & Lou. (by-the-way if Will so wanted to die why didn't he give in to his lung infection when hospitalized? It surely would have easily killed a quadriplegic)On the other hand it's not too difficult to take Lou as the 'Me' because she has dedicated her efforts to 'change Will' and bring him out of his self imposed reclusiveness and bitterness toward life. Lou is determined to make him change his mind on being euthanized. So there's the conflict - neither one actually respects the emotional bond & love that has developed between them. Will hates his physical existence and wants death as a release. Lou can only focus on how happy she is being with him. Both are not thinking about how the other one feels.My other problem with this story is very simple to grasp. Will has everything a person could want and the intelligence to create a new life for himself but chooses death because he cannot live as he did before his disability. The producers of this story are implying a disabled person is less of a human due to a disability, is permanently unhappy, and not capable of contributing to society thus death is their best option! If Will was fine physically but emotionally depressed and wanted to be euthanized would the viewing public be as enthusiastic about this movie? Definitely not!The subconscious messages in this story are shameful but go completely unnoticed because they are wrapped up and hidden in a sweet & tearful tragic love story.",Me Before You,2674426
32,gulag,A Truly Dishonest Film,3/10,13 December 2016,"So what does the phrase ""Me Before You"" mean? Does it mean I will be unselfish and put myself and my wishes before yours? Not from the context of this film.For most of this movie I tended to be with it. It was refreshing to see Emilia Clarke as a vulnerable emotional goofball. And then came the point of decision. And she pours her heart out to him, revealing the depth of her feeling for him. And yet he resolutely chooses death. And then after what seems like it might have been a chance to ruminate over the meaning of life she is convinced very easily that the most loving thing is to be by his side at his chosen end. And he dies. Plot spoiled but you really should know this now before you see it. And she gets scads of money to follow her heart and and a goodbye note telling her to forget about him. Fat chance. At the point of decision I thought to myself if he chooses life even with his pain this would be a pretty good romantic movie. But then I thought if this story takes the road chosen by the obvious media proclivities of the 21st Century he'll choose to die, but he'll give her money. Sure enough.And the moral to the story is this. Each person lives alone. Love is figment of the moment. Nobody changes their minds and to try to do so would be morally wrong. What is most important is to follow your dreams. Any serious lessening of the ability to do that would be to live so poorly that only death is a cure. So he can no longer follow his dreams, and though his existence clearly helps and changes her life for the good, that is NOT good enough reason to live with serious pain. And since she gets to follow her dreams everything is ultimately for the best.What utter bullshit. It is really time to start questioning the assumption that the meaning of life is to follow one's dreams, especially since it is clear that this is the fondest wish of the commercial establishment upon us. It is only the illusion of choice. ""Me Before You"" now seems to mean I'm before you in line and you aren't cutting in. It becomes the complete statement of selfishness.",Me Before You,2674426
33,studioAT,A surprisingly good film,6/10,1 May 2017,"I don't watch 'Game of Thrones' - I know that in itself is a crime - so I hadn't really seen anything Emilia Clarke had been in prior to watching this film. However, she's so good in this it's ridiculous. Warm, funny, engaging, it's not to say that she carries the film, because of course Sam Caflin (who I only knew from the horrible 'Love Rosie' does his fair share, but she shines in her role.The film itself is much better than I thought it would be. It's heartfelt without ever being sentimental, it's full of engaging moments. I don't know why the critics weren't more positive about it.I didn't start watching this film with high hopes, but I was very pleased to be proved wrong.

34,Horst_In_Translation,"Pretty good movie, with occasional shots at greatness",8/10,2 September 2017,"""Me Before You"" is a definite contender for the most known romantic drama of 2016. But first things first: This one here runs for 110 minutes and was directed by Thea Sharrock while Jojo Moyes adapted her own novel for the screen here. And the result isn't shabby at all as this one scored a decent deal of awards recognition that turned the film into by far the most known work for both writer and director. And while male lead actor Sam Claflin has already starred next to the likes of Kristen Stewart, Jennifer Lawrence, Johnny Depp and other pretty big names from Hollywood, there is no denying that he plays only second fiddle here to female lead Emilia Clarke. The latter is of course known to millions, if not billions, from Game of Thrones, but good news is that thanks to the different hair color, it is very easy to not see her Daenarys character this time which may have hurt the film overall. I think she did a very good job. Her energetic, sparkling presence was one of the best aspects about the film and makes it easy to forgive her for occasional moments of ""overthetopness"", for example when her boyfriend arrives on her birthday and she tells everybody that somebody rang the doorbell. They also really tried to make her look not as gorgeous as she is, which was a huge challenge as even in these strange clothes she was obviously still a huge stunner. Claflin did a very good job too and he had the difficult task that really all his acting had to take place above his neck because of the character's disability. I found him memorable. Other known names include Charles Dance, Oscar nominee McTeer or Matt Lewis from Harry Potter, but honestly those were just in the shadows of the two protagonists because their material simply wasn't on the same level in terms of both quality and quantity.As a whole, I thought this was a really good film. The writing was smart on many occasions and it is always a success for films closer to 120 minutes than to 90 minutes if they drag as little as this one here. It also manages to stay away from the pretentious side and there was the danger it could enter this area on several occasions. But it managed nicely. The film is also not trying to make any political statements as it really is all about the tragic(?) story of the two protagonists here. Some scenes stay in mind especially like when he reveals his suicide plans to her because his body was a cage. Or also the scene in which she is watching an old video of him before the accident. The film included exactly the right approach to romance too in my opinion. They did not have to go for a huge love story or anything in order to have the tragedy work here. If you enjoyed this film as much as I did, then let me recommend you ""A Walk to Remember"" or ""Griffin and Phoenix"" or ""The Notebook"" although I am sure you have at least seen the latter already. Back to this one here, I do share the praise and I think it is an achievement that feels both real and touching. Maybe it is generally more for women, but definitely not exclusively if you manage to open yourself up here to the fate of the two protagonists. I also quite like the title. I am not a Game of Thrones fan at all, so I guess this makes up for a slight Emilia Clarke fanboy tendency and turns me into a neutral observer. A good, no a great watch for people curious about Game of Thrones stars in other projects. And actually for everybody else too. This film is among 2016's very finest and I highly recommend checking out.",Me Before You,2674426
35,lynansaysingle,Tear-jerker,10/10,5 September 2018,"A beautiful and unforgettable love story, great acting, great chemistry between the lead actors. I love this movie. One movie you just cant watch once. You want to relieve the experience over and over again as sad as it is. Cant watch it without the tissues. There is one other love story very similar to this that I found as beautiful which was ""Dying Young"" (Julia Roberts and Campbell Scott). This is definitely a must see.

Through this film, Thea Sharrock shows us that life does not always go as we want, but it must be lived fully, make the most of. The fact that Will still decides to end his life despite all Louisa's efforts to restore a taste for life, shows that even love can not change the way we see things because deep down he knew that nothing would change. But because he loved her, he changed Louisa's life so that she could live it as she pleased. Love takes many forms and even paralyzed or dead we can continue to bring happiness to those we love.

My only criticism is could you not have used one of our great kiwi actors - seriously you had to use an Australian pretending to be a kiwi badly. However the movie is lovely. I don't think I have seen a theatre in Masterton New Zealand as full as the one tonight and every one of us was thrilled to see it. They have kept the movie pretty much to the book which was great although I treat a movie as different from the book. Well done Sam Claflin I didn't see a single movement out of character. That must have been a tough thing to do so an impressive effort. I don't watch GOT so I had no preconceived ideas about Emilia Clarke and I thought she was great.A difficult subject and one that we have had several notable kiwi's go through. Well done Jojo Moyes.,Me Before You,2674426
38,prospectus_capricornium,"Mostly Manipulative, But Tears are Earned",7/10,19 June 2016,"It would be hard to hold back the tears, once 'Me Before You' moves along the emotionally-charged course of its unevenly laid-out entirety. Imbued with charismatic flair and some ravishing sentiments, the Emilia Clarke and Sam Clafflin starrer, is every hopeless romantic dream. It is bound to recreate the familiar 'heaven and earth' trope, with all its utter predictabilities and tiring cheesy clichés, but here, the tears are mostly rightfully earned.Clarke's Lou, emerges as the brightest asset of this manipulative drama, her buoyant demeanor creates an affectionate atmosphere for this whole fairytale-ish attempt whose often leaning towards emotional tragedy is ever screaming at every turn of the proceedings. Her sprightly charm makes an indispensible compensation for the largely stale performance pulled by Clafflin who plays here, a quadriplegic near real-life prince, who enlisted the service of Clarke's caregiver character. But together they conjure magic, enough to sprinkle their often predictable storyline with heart-crippling charm.The biggest flaw of this film, perhaps, is how it seemed written to manipulate. That is not to say it isn't effective, because in fact it often works, but you would still think, and wonder, how more beautiful it would have become, had it been written with pure authenticity. Be that as it may, you've got to give it to those at its helm for molding an extremely poignant drama, that even if its often undermined by its easily recognizable motives, isn't devoid of wit, humor, and charm, and jaw-dropping glamor from two of the most beautiful faces to ever star in such romantic tragedy.",Me Before You,2674426
39,jchen-07237,Proved Me Wrong,9/10,16 March 2019,"When my mother clicked on this movie on our TV, I was more than unwelcome. Oh, great. Another sappy love story. But as soon as I started watching it, I was hooked. It gave me another idea of love. Clark made me laugh and Traynor made me agree and nod in reason. This quirky, heartbreaking movie is something special.

40,Movie-Scene-by-Temo,The right to death with dignity?,6/10,5 April 2019,"We all have the right to a life of dignity... but what about the right to death with dignity?Financial wizard, Will Traynor is a quadriplegic (paralysis from the shoulders down) who's living at home with his parents in a castle that lies on the edge of a small English village. He's been paralyzed for 2 years and despite all his efforts at physical therapy only has movement in his thumb plus facial muscles. His parents have created a safe environment for him: a conversion of their large castle's stables into a comfortable home, a male nurse to feed, clean, bathe and change him and now a friendly, quirky companion in Lou Clarke. Unspoken is Traynor's mother's prayer: Clarke will dissuade Traynor from his self-made appointment with death in six months.Director Thea Sharrock (The Hollow Crown, As You Like It) effectively handles the introduction of this heated, controversial subject in this light romance by giving us the perspective of one life... a life that could go on into the distant future with heavy medical involvement, a life that could continue to contribute to society, a life that could perhaps find satisfaction in this ""lesser"" state. The mostly new-to-feature film director, writer and young leading cast, are well-supported by a cinematographer with decades of experience, Remi Adefarasin OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) (Match Point, About a Boy, Elizabeth).Sam Claflin (Snow White and the Huntsman, The Hunger Games) plays the quadriplegic Traynor, the romance male-lead, with Emilia Clarke (Game of Thrones) his companion. They both have faces that are great for screen closeups, important when bodies can't move. Clarke, famously known for playing Daenerys Targaryen, Mother of Dragons, has a face so mobile her eyebrows seem to do acrobatics far removed from her stoic face in Game of Thrones. She also has a lot more to say in a candid, quirky manner, which soon brings out the mischievous side of Traynor, always up for a dare and adventure. The movie is carried by the two and they do a good job interacting.Me Before You could have been set anywhere in the world, but the castle-village setting suits-if you have a Lord of the Manor character, why not give him one, with the young, naïve love interest played by a village girl. Also to emphasize the wealthy lifestyle is the private jet they use to go on holiday-very fairytale, Mills & Boon romance, a formula that has worked for decades.Dialogue does flow and is well matched to the accompanying actions, not surprising as author Jojo Moyes also wrote the screenplay. The challenge of showing the life extreme-sports-devotee Traynor had before becoming a quadriplegic is easily and effectively solved when Clarke finds a short video (set to James Bond music) of Traynor doing many athletic feats-diving off cliffs into the sea, water skiing, bungy/sky jumping-narrated by a group of his admiring friends. Traynor definitely craved and loved physical adventure and his body was very toned and fit. Cut to his life now, immobile, needing assistance even to lift his head off his pillow or sitting, staring fixedly out of the window at the flat, colourless countryside, the only thing still agile being his mind and slowly recovering sense of humour.The right to a dignified life for all is cemented in most constitutions across the globe. To choose when to die is something only provided for in some places, and only for those who have reached the hospice state of care when the doctor certifies that the patient only has a short period of time left to live, that death is inevitable from illness, disease, or injury, and that there are no medical interventions that can change this. At such a time the patient can choose death assisted by medical staff. But what if one is stuck in between: a diminished physical life that cannot improve but continues with high medical care and cost and still an acute mental ability. If such a person decides against living, are there ethical, social, moral, religious, spiritual, personal rights to be observed? Protected? Should that person too be allowed to choose death, or is it ""murder"" as one of the support actors states.This is one of several books, movies and documentaries I've seen recently on the right to choose death, something many with the means have been doing for a time now. Well worth a watch, the viewer can take from it what they choose: the light-hearted fare of a chick-flick or the deeper philosophical discussion.",Me Before You,2674426
41,milyward,Beautiful,10/10,7 June 2016,"I have already read the book, so I decided to most definitely see the movie. I think that they did very well on a book to movie adaptation, because they didn't change too much from the book. The movie was beautifully made, and fit just what I and others who have read it in my city had pictured for the movie.The casting was brilliant, as with the portrayal of Louisa and Will. Both characters were charismatic, and enjoyable, and matched the dialogue of the book, which I thought was great.The movie itself was heartbreaking, hilarious at points, and just and lovable. The story itself is well thought out and great. One of the best things about this, is it is not just your usual love story. The real love doesn't take over the whole plot. It isn't fully made to feel intimate, but just to feel real.So I say: Go see it. If you are a boy or girl, it doesn't matter. This movie is memorable for everyone.",Me Before You,2674426
42,phd_travel,Beautifully done - superior handling of an old formula,9/10,1 November 2016,"In a beautiful Welsh town complete with a castle and moat, a young waitress becomes caregiver to a wealthy handsome young man who has become a quadriplegic due to a traffic accident. He wants to end it and she comes to care for him more than just as a patient.Things are kept restrained and light hearted for most of the movie so that when more dramatic parts arrive it is much more effective. During the wedding of his ex girlfriend his pain is quite moving. The emotional climax in their tropical getaway is one of the more effective scenes in recent tear jerkers.Emilia Clarke gives an effervescent likable performance with her quirky costumes. Her character is likable and one that could easily have been annoying but she avoids that. Sam Claflin does a good job. Considering he can only move from the neck up for most of the movie he manages to convey all his character is going through. The relationship between the two is believable and not over sentimental. Charles Dance and Janet McTeer plays his parents. Liked the contrast with her working class family and their simple pleasures.If you can remember the Julia Roberts movie 'Dying Young', 'Me Before You' shows how to take a theme that has been done before but do it better.The issue about assisted suicide is handled well. It doesn't preach but you feel alright with his choice at the end.This movie deserved to be a success. Worth watching.",Me Before You,2674426
43,socrates4,A Fine Romance Film,7/10,19 April 2019,"ME BEFORE YOU is a pretty good take on the romance film. It's not a romantic comedy by any stretch, but more of a sort of drama that has something to say. And whichever way you feel about the issues presented here (even the main characters share conflicting and ambiguous views about them) you will certainly enjoy this.What makes it good is that it's not too cheesy, like so many other films of its kind. Admittedly, it feels a little cheesy toward the start, but it never crosses the line. There are some good laughs and you may even cry too. The acting is great, as is the script and the directing. I feel like the roles were perfectly cast. It's hard to imagine another group of actors would do as good of a job. Recommend.

44,shobanchittuprolu,Me Before You works mostly because of Emilia Clark's charming screen presence and few moments but its climax is shocking.,7/10,14 February 2017,"Me Before You (2016): When I read plot line of Me Before You,I was surprised to find it exactly similar to the french classic Intouchables (which was remade in Telugu as Oopiri),only in the other way around.The only difference is they have given a female lead in the caretaker role and as usually love blossoms between them even with such physical differences.But the only reason I watched this movie is for my Princess Khaleesi aka Daenerys Targaryen aka her off screen real name Emilia Clarke.Plot: Louisa Clark (Emilia Clark) is a small town girl who knows a lot about the people around her. Will (Sam Claflin) a quadriplegic man who hates everyone around him. Louisa is hired by Will's mum to take care of him for six months. Although they have a rocky start, their relationship grows over time, going for hate, to like, to love.What I felt: With exactly the same plot and almost same type of scenes like Intouchables ,Me Before You mostly works on Emilia Clarke's charming performance.Other than that,this movie has very few feel good moments but mostly the screenplay is totally predictable.These movies would only work if it has lot of feel good moments which can bring tears but this movie has none literally.The dinner ate Clark's home and the scene where Clark and Will dances and the scene where they watch a movie are the scenes which are the highlight of the movie.As said earlier,Emilia Clark's charming screen presence helped the movie a lot.But her expressions with eyebrows are weird.It felt like she can even move her eyebrows downwards to ;-o.So apart from that she really is charming and I never even imagined Khaleesi being cute like this.Sam Claflin,whom I have seen earlier in Love,Rosie is very good in his role of a quadriplegic man.Music also helped the movie in lot of scenes.But the major surprise in this film is its daring climax.Most of them would not accept this ending (Including me to an extent),but as a fiction we cannot blame the director/writer.But he could have tried other options because this may affect lot of such disabled persons ideology.So,Me Before You works mostly because of Emilia Clark's charming screen presence and few moments but its climax is shocking.My rating 6.5/10",Me Before You,2674426
45,boodt-62758,A wonderful story,10/10,10 June 2016,"I was expecting the usual American love story, but that's not what this is. I have neither seen nor heard of these actors prior to seeing this film. That said, I usually don't go to see films like this.What a wonderful movie! The acting was so well done. My heart broke where it needed to break, and it laughed where it needed to laugh. For those who need help working on their empathy, or the opening of the mind, this is a very good movie to see!It's very thought provoking and I would even suggest to professors (philosophy,english,cultural perspectives in science, sociology) that they have their students write a paper on this. There are so many issues involved here. Great for discussion!",Me Before You,2674426
46,jadepietro,Love So Lame,4/10,14 June 2016,"(RATING: ☆☆ out of 5)   THIS FILM IS NOT RECOMMENDED.   IN BRIEF: There are disabilities aplenty in this sappy screen  adaptation, mostly in its politically- correct thinking.  GRADE: C-  SYNOPSIS: A beautiful caretaker falls in love with her handsome  quadriplegic patient.   JIM'S REVIEW: There have been much talk and many catchy phrases about  the subject of love that have been set to music: ""Love will find a way.  Love hurts. Love makes the world go round. Love will keep us together.  Love the one you're with. True love never runs smooth."" These pop  ditties are never heard in the insufferable tearjerker of a movie  entitled Me Before You. Still they do form the basis for the  relationship of two mismatched beautiful people who become soulmates  amid love's many obstacles.   ￼The story goes like this: Recently unemployed Louisa (Emilia Clarke)  becomes a nursemaid and companion to handsome but clinical depressed  Will Trayor (Sam Clafin), once a rugged sportsman and successful  executive, the whole package, and now a disheartened quadriplegic. Will  has no will to live but Louisa, or Lou as she is lovingly called, is  Little Miss Sunshine personified, a kooky supposedly adorable waif and  perhaps the perfect antidote to Will's bouts of suicide. At least  Will's rich parents hope that Lou will be the cure-all to lift Will's  spirits and change his mind and mood swings. It didn't change mine.  ￼With an abysmal screenplay by Jojo Moyes and based on her best-selling  novel (which I fortunately did not read but am told the book tackles  more serious themes), the film shies away from any semblance of reality  and settles smack dab in the soapiest of waters. I guess every  generation needs its own Love Story, but is it too much to ask for some  darker moments to help us relate to Will's physical condition? One only  hears of, but never sees, Will's pain and suffering.  ￼Yet Will isn't the only one suffering here. Any moviegoer in their  right mind would want to pull the plug on this claptrap. Truthfully,  the whole ethical issue of patient's rights and euthanasia deserves a  fair better and more honest treatment. (That was done in a film called  The Sessions. View that excellent film instead, dear readers.)  ￼But this is suppose to be a love story, the equivalent to a pulpy  romance paperback novel. And on its own terms and genre, the movie  fails miserably, mostly due to insipid directorial debut by Thea  Sharrock, who searches out for the tritest of images and succeeds in  making the bad even worse, laughably outrageous ""exotic"" costumes by  Jill Taylor, and the hammiest performance by one of the leads.   ￼Try as he must, Mr. Caiflin does bring some poignancy to his poorly  written character. How he was able to keep a straight face throughout  this film and watch Ms. Clarke overdo her acting in the most ridiculous  of outfits and hair styles would be challenging enough for any actor.  The actress is not helped by her director or costumers. She is seen in  the most garish of garb, from fuzzy colorful sweaters and busy ugly  prints, in outfits any fashionable 13 year old would instantly reject.  Her hair styles range from braids and pigtails to Frau Brucher Germanic  up-dos, which telegraph more emotion than the actress can muster. We  are suppose to be enamored by Lou's quirkiness, but the overall effect  is an off-putting goofiness. Who could blame Will for ending his  life...suicide would be anyone's choice after experiencing Ms. Clarke's  cutesy performance!  If nothing else, there is fine supporting work by Charles Dance, Janet  McTeer, and Brendan Coyle, all distinguished British actors who would  be wise to omit this film from their resume. Also, Stephen Peacocke,  resembling a young Hugh Grant, literally does some heavy lifting and  delivers a nicely nuanced performance as Will's full-time doctor,  Nathan, one of the few subtlest contributions found in this film. (By  the way, in retrospect, everyone is so inexplicably darn good-looking  in this movie.)  ￼With all that is said and done here, writer H. L. Mencken's ultimate  quote of the subject of love may succinctly sum up everything that is  wrong with this silly film: ""Love is a triumph of imagination over  intelligence."" Me Before You has neither of those valued commodities.",Me Before You,2674426
47,blrnani,"Wow, how different from Game of Thrones!",8/10,9 October 2017,"Emilia Clarke is cute and totally lovable in this film, portraying a quirky character who is all heart. And I can understand why girls might swoon over Sam Claflin, even when (SPOILER ALERTS) wheelchair bound.Despite the tragic background, this is a delightful film that, while raising very serious issues, focuses on the personalities and how they interact. The result is often very funny, but also very moving.Consequently, I am saddened by the reaction of some people, but it also helps me to understand the Trumpist backlash against the 'thought police' in American society. Because unfortunately there are some people who are not content to allow others to watch a film and form their own opinions about the issues portrayed. They want to tell them how to feel and how to think and it is heretical if the film allows the viewers to come to conclusions that may differ from their own. If the film does not specifically embrace their own views and values then they will try to harm it at the box office by driving people away through their rabid criticism.Fortunately, this film is way above that putrid level and can be enjoyed both as entertainment (comedy, drama & romance) and for the meaningful questions about life that it raises. I found it comparable to ""Whose Life Is It Anyway"" and even better than ""The Intouchables"".",Me Before You,2674426
48,hthbrr2,Emilia Clarke's eyebrows make this movie unwatchable,1/10,23 August 2016,"I tired to watch this movie I really did. But I quickly realized that Emilia Clarke CAN'T ACT. And made the movie unwatchable.What I do with movies is skip through them a bit just to get a feel of what the movie is like. Too many movies I sit through about 10 mins and I feel like 'I wasted 10 min of my life I will never get back!' NEVER AGAIN! So I skip and within a few minutes can tell if I should even BOTHER watching the whole movie. I did this with this one and saw there was nothing worth watching. Just a pile of dung really.So basically, as most people can tell by the current state of cinema, that it's not really the movie that is important, it's what is behind the scenes. Like take the recent Suicide Squad. Hyped as all get out. And it turned out to be a dud. I have not seen it yet, but I am not shocked. The REASON that movie was made was to cash in on the popularity of superhero movies. Avengers, Justice League, Bat/Super/Spider man, etc.Now to the reason this movie was made: THIS movie is a VEHICLE to try and launch the career of these two actors. Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin. Emilia Clarke is famous for the same reason Sasha Grey is, to put it lightly. Emilia Clarke appeared totally naked in the basically soft core p0rn TV show + gore that is ""Game of Thrones"". That is all really. The only reason she is in this movie is to make her look like a 'serious/real actress'. Nope, sorry girl, you are just a piece of meat, you wont fool me. And Sam Claflin, sorry, you can act, but you just can't carry a movie. You will ALWAYS be ONLY a SUPPORTING actor. Sorry. I thought we learned that lesson in the failure that was ""Love, Rosie"" (2014). Lily Collins ALSO can't carry a movie. WHY are we making the same mistake in THIS movie????It was painful watching Emilia Clarke try to break her type casting as the 'hot girl' playing a 'nerdy girl'. REALLY? Painful to watch just painful. She can't act, and the movie is just trash. The story as well. I mean it's like insult to injury. Imagine a sick old hobo just lost control over his bowels and bladder, in a dumpster where he was digging for food, and you throw a dead body on top, vomit, throw some dirty diapers in there, and top it all off with medical waste. That is a good way to describe this movie. From bad to worse. 1. Bad actress 2. No leading man 3. Bad plot 4. bad .......well you get the point.Good movies are just good movies, there should be no ulterior motives. Just make a movie. I don't even know what I fu(&!ng expected from this movie it was so bad. A nice little rom com at least. Nope just a pile of tripe. STOP making movies for reasons other than making a good movie!(p.s. her eyebrows were Emma Watson level bad)",Me Before You,2674426

50,hydearchie,An unfortunate tail,1/10,1 July 2016,"I have never read the book so did not know the ending of this story (which I will not give away). I suggest however, that nobody watch this film without at least reading the synopsis so they know how it ends - it may change your mind about watching it in the first place or at least prepare you for one of the most tasteless endings in a film ever. The problem is that the movie is so sweet and monotoned that the depressing ending both assaults you and offends. It is not giving anything away to say that the male character is contemplating Dignatas' services. With no judgement whatsoever on this it is important to note that this is a compassionate organisation, but according to all media far from luxurious. The book may have dealt in detail with the realty of disability so deadly or degrading that the sufferer feels deeply they need release. However, this movie treats the illnesses associated with the male character's disability as intermittent blips in an otherwise improving quality of life. It leaves such a bitter taste in the mouth because the conclusion is that a valuable life must be expansive and in an able body! Being close to parents, loving unconditionally, life unexpected are failures. It is a shame as the performances are great - if the movie was a real romcom with a joyful ending or a serious drama with a tragic twist this story could have worked - unfortunately, it was neither; rather it was an amusing film that meandered off the side of a cliff with a thud...",Me Before You,2674426
51,eddie_baggins,Something's off in this wannabe tear-jerker,4/10,15 February 2017,"Featuring the strange proposition of The Mother of Dragons living a life where she cares for the tragically paralysed son of Tywin Lannister, Me Before You is 2016's attempt at becoming ""the big romantic hit"" as debut director Thea Sharrock adapts Jojo Moyes well liked book of the same name, which is in turn a rejigged version of the 2011 hit The Intouchables into a totally over the top and highly overdone romantic drama.In what's her highest profile gig outside of the 6 seasons of playing Game of Thrones beloved dragon mother, Brit star Emilia Clarke goes next level of loving life as the seemingly carefree and unflappable stocking loving Lou Clark who takes up the job of becoming a friend to The Hunger Games Sam Claflin's quadriplegic Will Traynor, that will in turn see the two fall tragically in love as Will contemplates ending his now unfortunately paralysed life.It's an intriguing idea, if not totally original and there's potential here for many tears, laughs and smiles but everything within Sharroack's film feels either forced, full of fakery or misjudged emotional manipulations as Clarke in particular suffers from her role in the film that allows her to go completely wild with her unfortunately annoying and coy Lou and it really does beg the question of how much of a career she may have outside of the GOT universe if she continues on in this fashion.Lou Clark may just be last year's most intolerable creation, as while we all love someone that sees the brighter side of life, this is something else entirely as Clarke and her eyebrows, over extended smile and genuine ADHD tendencies trample the films chances as Lou and Will's relationship turns from forced friendship to genuine love.Clarke needed to dial back her role especially as Claflin gives his all as Will (even if you've never seen a quadriplegics body looked quite this toned before) and while the film clearly connected with its ready-made target audience as evidenced by its respectable world-wide box office and audience ratings, it's unlikely that many will be remembering the hard fought romance of Lou Clark and Will Traynor as we'd remember the Noah and Allie's or Edward Lewis and Vivian Wards of the movie universe.A refreshingly kind spirited movie that just never connects emotionally or engages thanks to a so-so structure and a completely misguided female centrepiece, Me Before You will be a favourite to those that loved the movie before they even saw it but for the rest of us, this sappy, cringe-worthy and forgettable romance just doesn't cut the romantic mustard.2 fit Neville Longbottom's out of 5",Me Before You,2674426
52,abouhelier-r,Movie Vs. Book: Me Before You,8/10,4 July 2016,"A girl in a small town forms an unlikely bond with a recently-paralyzed man she's taking care of. It's easy to be cold and cynical these days, but we should never lose sight of the simple, cathartic pleasure of a good cry at the movies. At first, I didn't want to review this novel – nor the movie – because I knew I would want to re-read it. Which might seem perverse if you know that for most of the last hundred pages I was dissolved in tears? Based on the best-selling 2012 novel by Jojo Moyes who also penned the screenplay. This story will feel familiar to anyone who sniffed through Love Story or The Fault in Our Stars. Surprisingly it's better than both. Me Before You is a love story, a family story and above all, it's a story of the bravery and sustained the effort needed to redirect the path of a life once it's been pushed off course. This is also a story that is eloquent not so much in its delivery as in its humanity. The set up is the same as many of classic (and non-classic) romance: a poor but cheerful young girl meets a rich, grumpy gentleman and begins working for him. But what makes Me Before You different and quite interesting in principle is that Will Traynor is physically broken as well as emotionally.You'll forgive the movie's clichés because of its surprisingly winning performances. As the film goes on and the frost between both protagonists melts, both actors give their stock roles unexpected emotional layers. On a basic level, it is engaging watching Lou enter this new world for which she is entirely unprepared. Game of Thrones' Emilia Clarke stars as Louisa, she's like Love Actually-era Keira Knightley, crossed with a Hello Kitty doll. Clarke's sincerity doesn't just win Will's heart, it wins ours too. Will Traynor since he's played by Sam Claflin, whose Finnick Odair was one of the best things in the Hunger Games series, isn't just killer handsome or impossibly good- looking even if his condition has left him bitterly depressed and cuttingly sarcastic in a wheelchair. The actor is good as Will, working well with the physical demands of the role and even bringing a gentle flirtatiousness to his character, as he develops his relationship with Lou. In fact, his grin, with its slight touch of a smirk – creates an unmistakable echo of a young Hugh Grant. Sam Claflin makes Will a broken man with a powerful life inside him. Plus, Will's character makes me think of Mr. Rochester in Charlotte Brontë's Jane Eyre; with his rudeness and temper. While Louisa is so Jane Eyre: ""One of the invisible"". Lou has never lived; Will has, but no longer can. You don't have to be Nicholas Sparks to know where this is heading – that these two opposites will end up attracting, and that love, at least for a while, will prove stronger than death. Lou is not heroic and her male counterpart may be nobody's idea of a leading man or Prince Charming, and yet with both of them, Jojo Moyes created an affair I will always remember.Me Before You is a heartbreaker in the best sense. Employing emotional truth to bring the reader to tears. And yet, unlike other novels, tears are not gratuitous. Some situations, the author forces the reader to recognize, really are worth crying over. Furthermore, people can take an awful lot of sadness if you can be funny about it. Jojo Moyes is a literary stylist. Just a storyteller. And a really good one. She manages to draw on the skills she owned as a journalist to create a clear, candid picture of the practicalities of Will's situation. While the novelist's mind casts an illuminating light on her character's reactions. Moyes makes them coming together extremely tender, both sweet and real. But there's a deadline. One that haunts their love story haunts the novel. The author is masterful, in not shying from the complexities or shading the agony of choosing between life and death. It's achingly hard to read at moments and yet such a joy.Screenwriters choose to lose the ""Maze"" scene when Lou recalls a sexual assault when she was younger. Often when you read about rape in fiction, it's the defining event of a story. And cutting it from the movie, I think, was a good thing because the scene is very opaque in the book, and putting it on film would have given it far more weight than it has in the book. Plus, it would have eventually change the mood of the story. However the ""Birthday Dinner"" scene, at Louisa's home, hits a particularly high note, offering the most poignant moment both in the book and the movie – its soul, really – as well as a pitch-perfect hilarious one. Finally, my favorite part of both the film and the book is when Will and Lou go out on a ""date"" to a concert. She wears a dress of sexiest scarlet, and as they are in the car ready to go home, he confesses in a very Hugh Gratian manner: ""I don't want to go in yet. I just want to be a man who's been to a concert with a girl in a red dress."" I know a good British rom-com reference when I see one.Overall, Me Before You doesn't try to reinvent the genre. We've all seen some version of this movie before, but that doesn't make it any less effective. It knows what it is and embraces it. ""Tell me something good,"" Will says to Louisa at two transformative junctures of the book. This story at its heart is about two people who properly listen to each other, it is something good. Now if you'll excuse me, I have something in my eye. It's allergies, I swear.",Me Before You,2674426
53,jrarichards,"Worthwhile, moving film with much more edge than it may first seem to have",8/10,30 June 2016,"Reasonably, this film (based on Jojo Moyes's book and screenplay) is indeed 'romantic drama' more than 'rom-com"", which is not to deny its comedic elements. But all should know that there is a powerful, demanding current capturing this film, which draws in part on the case of disabled British rugby player Daniel James and the question of his parents being charged for accompanying him to Switzerland's Dignitas clinic (in the end they were not). In the (full) cinema I was in, there really were few dry eyes in the house. I'll concede that mine stayed dry (not always the case), though I still find the piece affecting and thought-provoking and unquestionably worth seeing.2 big questions concerned Emilia Clarke's chances of getting beyond (and above) Danaerys, and Sam Claflin's ability to portray someone who combines near-total physical disability with marked vulnerability to infection - the double whammy that convinces our hero that his life really and truly and literally is not worth living.To my mind, both questions can be answered affirmatively.Claflin's character Will Traynor is good-looking, rich and still influential. He has a commanding personality (if mostly initially grumpy and arrogant), a sharp mind and a capacity to develop Clarke's character Lou(isa) ... Clark (yes, really). That begs A LOT of questions (not sidestepped) about the contribution he can still make, not least because he has support (moral and financial) from loving and well-to-do parents - nicely done by Janet McTeer and Charles Dance. And of course not least because he makes Lou Clark love him, even though she at first has a relationshp with Patrick (played by Matthew Lewis), which is not getting very far, but is genuine, affectionate and definitely physical, if also sustained by Clark's decency and supportive nature. Patrick is by no means a failure (he's been Entrepreneur of the Year). He's a bit dull, but not stupid or unkind, and of course he's a triathlon-type athlete. Yet he can't quite offer Lou what Traynor can (a huge and demanding thought in itself).And Emilia Clarke does indeed offer a convincing and often-touching portrayal of that growing love (as mirrored in her character's personal development in terms of interests and style and maturity - though emphatically not basic kindness, decency, humility and optimism with life, given that this is manifest from the outset and never wavers).This is actually then a demanding role. So much emphasis is placed on Clark's eccentric dress sense that one might start to write her off as a bit oafish. But that does not pan out. Clark is (over-?) loyal to her family, helping out financially, and so taking jobs below her potential. But she does what she does with conviction and optimism, puts all her heart and soul into each of her jobs, and she does know who she is. Hence her metamorphosis in the film adds new dimensions, but not at the expense of the old ones.Emilia Clarke is great at all this, and she proves well able to portray inner beauty increasingly augmented by outward beauty in the more conventional sense; and when Clark looks at - and touches - her nearly immobile charge, an audience-member not made of stone is going to feel the power of the affection, and also the restraint associated with the inevitable non-physicality and asymmetry of the bond.At at least one point in the film a comparison with Stephen Hawking is made, and this is not an idle one. There are also references to ""My Left Foot"" and that film's real-life Irish hero Christy Brown. Hawking steadily lost abilities, yet espoused technology to fight back and contribute. He wanted to understand the universe, and he has lived longer than anyone else ever with his disease. Christy Brown taught himself to do great and wonderful things with the limb he could still control (hence the title of the story). At first glance, Traynor has fewer aces than Brown (whose story in fact ended unhappily with his death aged 49 in 1981), though more than Hawking (whose amazing story continues). Yet Traynor wants out and is committed to that idea with a devotedness that even Clark's love cannot shift.In spite of the chocolate-box pretty Pembrokeshire, Buckinghamshire and Mediterranean locations, this is not forgettable movie-candy. One does indeed return to the subject. And the person I saw it with came back at me a while after with the suggestion that Traynor and Clark could have married, had a kid (not necessarily even adopted?), and been worthwhile and useful and good parents making a contribution to the next generation, all the more so given further years of support from his parents and also her family (portrayed sympathetically enough by the familiar Brendan Coyle, Samantha Spiro and Jenna Coleman). And while that would have involved sacrifice and risk (given Traynor's endless susceptibility to disease that would presumably have done for him soon enough), it would have left a legacy.There's really no answer to that, given that Traynor chooses to eschew such options; and - as the film emphasises again and again - that's his sovereign decision in regard to his life. One gets the feeling that Clark's mother would not accept that choice, but the other characters come round to the idea - with great reluctance, but nevertheless.This is then a modern and radical film in a pretty and often traditional setting, but - as the above, nuanced references in it make clear - it is not judge and jury, at least not 100%. That role therefore falls to us, and this is as always a precious thing a (better) film can offer its audience.",Me Before You,2674426
54,Genti25,Romance well done,9/10,11 September 2016,"Me Before You is a romantic drama film directed by Thea Sharrock based on the novel by Jojo Moyes with the same name. The film stars Emilia Clarke, Sam Claflin, Jenna Coleman, Charles Dance, Matthew Lewis, Ben Lloyd-Hughes and Janet McTeer. The movie is about a girl named Lou Clark who is desperate for a job and so the goes on to take care of a recently paralyzed man from a rich family, who she slowly creates a bond with. This is a well made movie with amazing performances all around, especially by the amazing Emilia Clarke who gives a wonderful performance on the leading role. By her side is Sam Claflin who plays Will Traynor, and he does a very good job too. It is a movie filled with heart breaking emotional scenes, very good cinematography and a brilliant score by Craig Armstrong that makes Me Before You as a whole one of the best romances there are. Sure it has some problems, and the ending will leave some people confused and angry but overall this movie works on so many levels that those flaws are hardly even noticeable as the good outweighs the bad by a lot.

55,malpasc-391-915380,"Enjoyable, funny, sad",8/10,12 July 2021,"I've watched Me Before You twice and both times I've really enjoyed it. Its funny, uplifting but also sad.As I'm not disabled, and don't know anyone in the situation the character Will is in I can't and don't want to question the motives of him wishing to end his life.The story is not hugely complicated. Wealthy young Will two years previous to most of the events in this film was involved in a road traffic accident with a motorcycle which caused him to become quadriplegic and he has moved back to his wealthy family (in Wales, although I don't think the location is specifically mentioned in the movie) to be cared for by his family and a nurse. Lou has always lived in the town and has never left. She's cheerful and upbeat, but has a boyfriend who doesn't really pay her much attention, focusing mainly on his running. Lou doesn't come from a wealthy family and is the main breadwinner for part of the movie. After becoming unemployed from her job in a cafe she gets a job as a carer for Will - someone to help feed him and carry out things he cannot do, as well as be a companion and a friend for him, as most of the friends from his old life have drifted away since the accident. This is something that can happen in real life when someone goes through something as traumatic and life changing as his accident was.At first Will is bitter and unfriendly towards Lou, always finding her positivity and upbeat outlook annoying and intrusive. As time goes on he begins to enjoy having Lou in his life as she begins to broaden his horizons, going out for fresh air, visiting different places, meeting her family and even going to the wedding of his ex girlfriend and his old best friend.The story is kind of predictable in the way these romantic comedy dramas usually are - people who seem mis-matched learn to accept and embrace what previously annoyed them about the other.Eventually Lou learns that Will wants to end his life in Switzerland as he doesn't feel his life is worth living anymore (again, I'm not going to go into this as I don't feel in any way best placed to). On this discovery she at first tries to make Will see that his life can be fulfilling and worth living regardless of his disability. They begin to fall for one another. In the end Lou doesn't manage to persuade Will. But does quite late come to accept his decision. What she doesn't realise is that in the meantime he has changed his will in order to allow Lou to live her best life, go and see things and broaden her horizons. He makes her see that her life is worth more than the small town she has always stayed in.This film will make you laugh, cry, and genuinely love and root for this couple. Both leads are completely convincing in portraying a couple who not only love one another but bring out the best in each other. The ending whilst incredibly sad - I cry at several points in this movie, is actually very uplifting.I know critics and some disability activists did not like how this movie played out, and of course their views are valid, but for me it doesn't take away from the overall enjoyment.",Me Before You,2674426
56,terrellrobinson71,It's time to live boldly with Will & Louisa in this terrific feel-good love story,8/10,20 July 2016,"It's really hard for me to not spoil the surprises of a movie like ""Me Before You"". For general moviegoers, they'll be expecting another love story about two people who fall in love until one of the characters has a dark secret that could tear them apart. For fans of the book, they will love the fact that it's incredibly faithful to the Jojo Moyes novel (See ""The Fault in Our Stars"", ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" and other true-to-the-book movies for details), but they will also get so much more out of it. I recently read the novel last month before the film came out and I found the book affectionate, funny and surprisingly uplifting. I think the key to any book-based movie is to find the right actors to have not only good chemistry, but to make sure that audiences will remember the characters in their hearts. Boy, have they lucked out with two immensely charming actors in this terrific film. ""Me Before You"" tells the story of Louisa ""Lou"" Clark (Emilia Clarke), a 26-year-old happy-go-lucky woman who has been trying to find the right job to support her working-class family. That is until she unexpectedly finds one by working as a caregiver to Will Traynor (Sam Claflin). Will was ""The Man"", that guy who had everything at the palm of his hands until an motorcycle accident left him an quadriplegic. Now he's sarcastic, bitter, moody and thinking of really dark thoughts. How did his heart turn to ice? Anyway, Lou refuses to be put off by a man who lost everything and gave his friends and everybody, as Lou calls it, ""the (crappy) treatment"". Suddenly, it starts off being an antagonistic relationship to a rather healthy one as Lou, with the help of her sister, Treena (Jenna Coleman), tries to help Will understand that life is definitely worth living for. And, yes, they do start to fall for one another, until Will has that secret that could end it all. I like the movie, but I do have a couple of minor problems: The first one is that the movie is not exactly as deep and sometimes dark as the book was. However, I give it points for letting the book and the movie asks the two questions: ""Can you fall in love with a person but disagree on what their opinion of life is?"" and ""Can that same person change your life, even when it's least expected?"" The second one is that first-time feature film director Thea Sharrock moves the film a little too fast without giving us a moment to understand Will's plight and Lou's cheerful earnestness while trying to get to the best parts of the story. But those problems did wash away with the help of Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin. Clarke, best known as the Mother of Dragons on ""Game of Thrones"", should've been a breakout movie star with that last Terminator movie. Here, that title suits Clarke well as the character of the quick-witted but sometimes vulnerable Lou. Claflin, in his first movie outside of ""The Hunger Games"" series, has the most challenging role, so far. But he is remarkable as the stubborn but sincere Will. Their chemistry together is amazing. The supporting cast is also good too, with Janet McTeer and Charles Dance (also from ""Game of Thrones"") as Will's parents who are constantly worried about him and his safety, Stephen Peacocke as Will's nurse, Nathan, Matthew Lewis (Hello, Neville Longbottom) as Lou's boyfriend who is completely uncomfortable about Lou's job, Brendan Coyle and Samantha Spiro as Lou's parents and there's also a really funny cameo from the ""absolutely fabulous"" Joanna Lumley. Credit must be given to Jojo Moyes, who adapted her terrific book to the screen (she also wrote the sequel book ""After You"") with some witty dialogue, tender emotion and sometimes dealing with real themes, although it's not as deep as the book. ""Me Before You"" is a simple story, sure. But while it probably won't be in my top 5 of the best love stories ever, I still found it to be in the same old tradition of tearjerkers, the one where you laugh, you cry and you'll come out feeling good. By the way, it's a lot better than ""The Choice"".",Me Before You,2674426
57,Jackbv123,Very relevant story,7/10,30 July 2017,"At the heart of this movie is an emotional political issue, but first let me say something about how well done the movie is.Of course Emilia Clarke does a wonderful job and is quite lovable in Lou's quirky way. Sam Claflin has a difficult part and does it well also. Janet McTeer and Charles Dance, as Will's parents, also play difficult roles and help us get drawn into the emotion of the story. I am a Jenna Coleman fan and had to wonder what she would have been like as Lou.It becomes clear about half way in that this is not going to be a happily ever after story no matter what happens in the end.As to the politics, I am against any kind of suicide for moral reasons. I don't believe that the choice of when a person dies lies with mortal man. More importantly, I am concerned that in a society where assisted suicide becomes at all common, it also becomes very easy for various forces to take away the choices of those who want to live. Insurance companies already are very close to taking away that choice in some cases. Will and his family did not seem to have the financial pressure. For people with a family that already lives on the edge financially, a medical condition like Will's could threaten to destroy it for everyone.On the other hand, I can sympathize with the way Will felt. While I don't condone the result, I can see how the hopelessness, especially the day to day hopelessness, can lead a person to think that Will's choice is the better one.I thought this story dealt with the issue respectfully and gives plenty of reason for thought and discussion.",Me Before You,2674426
58,sdebeaubien,Decent Acting...,4/10,17 June 2016,"My wife and I were very impressed at the beginning of this movie, and through the middle. We grew a bit uncomfortable when the young girl finds out the fellow in the wheelchair has decided to kill himself (through assisted suicide). At the end of the movie we both felt very let down. Not only did she not succeed in changing his mind, she actually becomes happy about it as if life is only lived for moments when you can really experience something.Sad, sad, commentary on life, and very narrow minded. First, I know a couple people who have been injured and confined to wheelchair, quadriplegic or otherwise. They took the time to adjust, and one has been that way for near 40 years and has a wonderful life. He did not quit or give up on life, just because his life before the accident was so ""Tremendous"" or whatever it was the wimpy dude said in this movie.If you want to make a movie about someone with redemption or about overcoming adversity, then you had best not have the person quit at the end, like a whiny cry-baby and try to convince everyone out there that ""The world is better off without me because I hate my life now, but loved it before..."" That's a cop out, totally and completely. It's not an ad for assisted suicide, it's just a dramatic interpretation of a dude who gave up, and let everyone down.We gave it 8/10 for acting. But, the overall movie is a 2 since the premise and the interpretation are so wrong. So, it gets a total score of 4/10 compromise from us.",Me Before You,2674426
59,neil-476,A difficult subject handled well,8/10,30 May 2018,"Who would have thought there were so many laughs in a tale of someone paralysed from the neck down? Emilia (Game Of Thrones) Clarke encounters Sam (Hunger Games) Claflin while involved with Matthew (Harry Potter) Lewis in a film which has nothing to do with any of those fantasy franchises!Lou is a tea shop waitress in a small rural English town. On losing her job she applies to become a carer for Will Traynor, paralysed in an accident. She doesn't realise what a moody unpleasant person he is, nor does she realise he is determined to commit assisted suicide at Dignitas in Switzerland. But as feelings start to grow between them, despite their intentions, could it be that Will might change his mind?To be frank, this isn't my sort of film, a feeling which was reinforced within the first 10 minutes as Lou turned out to be unbearably cute, endlessly compassionate towards the quirky old lady patrons of the cafe, possessed of an apparently massive wardrobe of unbelievably eccentric clothing and, to cap it all, convinced that all problems could be solved with a Nice Cup Of Tea. She was a character drawn from the Wacky And Loveable Young Thing box of clichés.And Sam Claflin's immobile moody young man was more credible, but no different in essence: Mr Rochester on wheels.But the two of them turned out to have decent chemistry, and the film turned out to have far more laughs than I expected, so I stuck with it. And I'm glad I did. It used humour to soften the edges of what, in many ways, was a very brutal story. Despite the late Christopher Reeve's sterling efforts in support of stem cell research, there is still currently no coming back from catastrophic spinal cord injuries, something which Lou does not initially realise, and something which lies at the heart of the once athletic Will's decision.Whether the burgeoning love between Will and Lou will be sufficient to overrule his decision is the dramatic focus of the story, and I would not want to spoiler the ending. But I will say that the circumstances and issues of quadriplegia and assisted suicide are presented unflinchingly, and without any moral judgement in either direction.This is an easier, more accessible film than Whose Life Is It Anyway?, the only other film I'm aware of which addresses this issue, but it doesn't draw conclusions any more easily than that film did.After being a bit queasily saccharine to start off with, Emilia Clarke settles in to the role, and both she and Claflin provide an effective emotional heart to the film: Janet McTeer and Charles Dance as Will's parents are also touching. The main location (Pembroke Castle) is gorgeous, and Clarke's wardrobe is (deliberately) awful. There was only one wrong note: I felt mild annoyance at the Traynor family's wealth. The ability to load Will onto a private jet and fly off to the Caribbean added a glib tone which I would have preferred to have been absent. The very end of the film fell into this category, too.Overall, though, this addressed a difficult subject in an entertaining and credible way.",Me Before You,2674426

61,cannonball-531-92699,Worst possible message EVER,1/10,21 February 2017,"Repeat, spoiler alert. Though, if you're wise, you won't waste your time on this movie.A summary would be, enter William, a rich, spoiled playboy who has everything he wants and does anything he wants with whomever he wants. Then he has a tragic accident, leaving him paralyzed. He decides that this kind of life isn't worth living, and wants to be killed. He promises his parents 6 months, where enters Lou, the charming, high-spirited woman who in an effort to show him life IS worth living (in which is still an entirely self-centered focused only on making himself happy), she falls in love with him. All seems to be going well, they think he has abandoned thoughts of suicide... but no. He selfishly decides to throw his life away, because he can't have everything his way. And it is wrapped in a cloak of care, and love, and support to people's decisions... but ultimately, it is sending the message, ""It doesn't matter who loves you, or how important you can be, or what you can do for others... if YOU don't have EVERYTHING you want and have it YOUR way, just give up."" In a day when depression and suicides are at an all-time high, here comes a story that had the potential to be a great encouragement to anyone dealing with depression and suicidal thoughts, but instead encourages people to give up and throw it all away.Especially when you think of the high percentage of suicides or attempts by teenage girls, and an actor like Sam who is idolized by many, presenting this message, it is appalling that such messages are being presented as ""entertainment"".",Me Before You,2674426

63,bxuser,A tearful film about how we choose to live,8/10,23 August 2021,"Emilia Clarke (Louisa ""Lou"" Clark) and Sam Claflin (Will Traynor) star together in a romantic drama about a bright and cheery woman who takes care of a quadriplegic former business man. The film investigates the topic of quality of life, and how we choose to live... not just from the perspective of Will's failing body, but also from the self imposed limitations Lou has placed on her worldview.The film quickly becomes a story about the choice of a young person in severely failing health to legally end his own life. Promising his parents 6 months of life after they initially refuse to help him, Will meets Lou. After discovering his plan, Lou tries everything to try to convince him to live.This film provides no answers. Rather it shows terrible impact of illness on quality of life, and the terrible impact a choice like euthanasia has on one's loved ones. As Will's body is failing, he is also helping Lou to understand what the ""quality of her life"" can be, helping her to explore her potential outside of the small town where she has lived somewhat limited by fear of new experiences.A moving investigation of what it means to live. I think it helps us all to ask the question of ourselves: ""How do I want to live?"" ... or perhaps if our life is naturally very close to it's conclusion: ""How do I want to die?""",Me Before You,2674426

I like the dialogue its quite charming and the comedy bits work really well .I was pleasantly surprised that there were not cliché moments and the flow of the story came naturally . The 2 main characters have great chemistry and Emilia Clark is simply adorable .Its a simple story told well.The director of the film did a good job overall however there was 1 problem with this movie and that was the soundtrack they used . Except the 2 bits of classic music the rest of it was simply abysmal and it really hurt the movie . It gave that cheesy soapy feel of a telenovela episode.But getting past that i really enjoyed this movie more then i thought i would and i would recommend watching this .

I and many audience has made an image of Emilia Clarke as a strong and Bold Character playing actress( well according to me only) as she had the recent movie of Terminator: Genisys, and the famous Khaleesi/ Mother of Dragons.Sam Claffin on the other hand did a tremendous job, he did his Homework very well, according to me he painted the perfect portrait of Will Traynor as a person who was full of life and how his life suddenly changes because of the Accident.

68,Teuton1978,Me Before You - Review,1/10,13 April 2017,"Where to begin...? Alright, Emilia Clarkes eyebrows are atrocious... As for the story. Rich boy has an accident ends up with a spinal cord injury and paralysed and fails to accept his fate and sticks to his decision to kill himself at the end because he's missing his old life. My issues with this stinker of a movie. 1. There is absolutely no depth to the main characters. One dimensional, materialistic morons who are absolutely unrelatable. 2. What is the message of this movie? 3. I'd find it easy as well to smile at the end, in memory of the person I loved, if that person would have left me rich after passing away. 4. One of the points, if not THE point of this tripe seems to be ""Once you are in a wheelchair you are out."" WOW, this kind of rubbish in 2017. However as far as this movie goes, the before the injury and after the injury was not teased out, kinda essential if your main character kills himself at the end and you want your audience to either understand his decision or to root for him. 5. If the audience would have had a chance to relate to both before and after injury, it would have been a better movie. 6. If the actual struggles and challenges of living with this injury would have been portrayed in a realistic enough way, it would have been a better movie. 7. If the main actress would have been able to actually act, it would have been a better movie. 8. If the main character would have been portrayed as a human being capable of making decisions for himself and people respected and supported him, regardless if they agreed or not, it would have been a better movie.

70,d-carlyle,Beautiful romantic film,9/10,21 October 2016,"One of the most romantic films I have seen for some time. Of course its a weepy, and how I blubbed, though I have previous in this regard, but it also swells the heart and leaves you with a beautiful warm glow. This should make real stars of the two main players with Claffin excellent as someone who's life has been destroyed by an accident leaving him not just paralysed, but also without the will to carry on. But the true stand out is Clarke, who's unquenchable cheerfulness and sunny outlook on life in the face of his depressed hostility has to be seen to be believed and maybe starts to turn him around? A lovely film with a beautiful ending.

Sam Claflin, believable in the role as well. A quality soundtrack accompanies the film. Many dislike the ending, but not me as the film is about Lou and it allows her to move on with fondness and opportunity ahead. They always go overboard concerning the current boyfriend, being a complete jerk. In regards to Will's circumstance, I didn't see an accident or a mistake, I saw carelessness.",Me Before You,2674426
72,Carycomic,Anybody who can sit through this with completely dry eyes has a snowball for a heart.,10/10,5 June 2016,"I initially went to see this in order to kill time on a rainy Sunday afternoon. And, also. because even the world's oldest comic book fanboy can get overloaded on superhero movies. But, to my surprise, I actually found myself liking this!For starters, it has a male lead who's actually a complete unknown to me! Sam Claflin, as Will Trainor. A 21st century aristocrat with an MBA who becomes quadriplegically paralyzed in a traffic accident. His gradual transition from self-pitying fatalist to relatively cheerful Charlie, over a period of six months, is due mostly to Louisa Clark.Lou, as she's known to family and friends, is played by Emilia Clarke. Picture the looks of a pre-WITCHBLADE Yancey Butler with the emotional range of Moira Kelly (from THE CUTTING EDGE) and the lovely accent of Rachel Weisz (from CHAIN REACTION and the first two MUMMY flicks). But, with the fashion sense of Reese Witherspoon's character during the first ninety minutes of LEGALLY BlONDE! It's this arsenal of qualities that brings Will out of his morbid funk. Even if only temporarily. I refuse to spoil the rest for you. Suffice it to say; any guy wishing to impress his girlfriend, with how sensitive he is, will succeed beyond all expectation if you take her to see this film! Fair warning, though. If you make the mistake of not bringing a whole box of Kleenex, then you'd better bring at least two of those (otherwise useless) boutique cubes of them.

Its got its emotional moments, but its the film's lighthearted tone, that makes it work.'Me Before You' Synopsis: A girl (Emilia Clarke) in a small town forms an unlikely bond with a recently-paralyzed man (Sam Claflin) she's taking care of.'Me Before You' is about living life & how love, can actually make things better. Over here, our leading-man is paralyzed, but he finds some hope when our leading-lady offers some hope & also love as their journey progresses. Even though the happiness doesn't change the leading-man's decision to eventually leave the world, he beautifully quotes to his love ""live well & consider your possibilities in life as luxuries"". Now, isn't that beautiful & so true. Jojo Moyes's nicely adapts from her own novel & delivers a genuinely affecting tale about love & loss. Thea Sharrock's Direction is restrained. Cinematography is top-notch. Editing is decently done. Art & Costume Design are fabulous. Craig Armstrong's Score is top-notch.Performance-Wise: Emilia Clarke & Sam Claflin are the life & soul of 'Me Before You'. Both deliver heartwarming performances. Sam makes you feel his pain & how life has done him wrong, while Clarke steals the show as the innocent & kind-hearted young girl. Their on-screen chemistry, also, is quite good. Janet McTeer & Charles Dance are remarkable as Sam's parents. Matthew Lewis is superb as Clarke's dim-witted boyfriend. Steve Peacocke lends wonderful support as Sam's care-taker.On the whole, 'Me Before You' is definitely worth watching. It makes you smile as well as makes you cry.",Me Before You,2674426

75,inkblot11,"Sweet, sorrowful film, beautifully presented; some viewers will not feel comfortable with the ethical issues",7/10,11 June 2016,"In the South of Britain, near Wales, a young businessman, Will (Sam Claflin) has just kissed his girlfriend goodbye on a rainy morning. He tries to hail a taxi but, unhappily, he is struck by a motorcycle. Meanwhile, Louisa Clark (Emilia Clarke) has been a waitress in a nearby café for six years, where she proved to be a friendly asset. Unexpectedly, she is given a pink slip and a month's wages. At home, the Clarks hear this news with dismay, for Papa Clark has been laid off and Lou's salary has been supporting them all. Undaunted, the fetching, zany-dressed young gal goes to the job center for new leads. There's one promising one. It seems a mother, Camilla (Janet McTeer) is searching for a nurse's aide to help her paralyzed son. Yes, its Will, from the movie's beginning, who is now confined to a wheelchair with little motion below his neck. Will's family, the Trainers, are the richest folk in the area and live in a modified castle. In short order, Louisa gets the position, for she is chatty and gregarious, despite her lack of nursing experience. But, wait, Will greets his new caretaker with undisguised rudeness, asking her to ""not talk"" to him and stay out of his way as much as possible. A roving nurse, Nathan, though, tells Louisa he is delighted she is there and assures her that Will is rude because his situation is so bleak. In time, things change. Will does become more communicative and is cheered by Lou's weird clothes and infectious manner. When his former girlfriend comes to break the news that she is engaged to a man who was once W's best friend, Louisa is there to help Will from falling to pieces. In fact, Lou and the nurse decide to put forth a list of outings which will, hopefully, change his view toward life. This involves going to the horse races and a symphony concert. Indeed, Will does seem cheerier. But, oh no, Lou overhears Will state he agreed to give himself six months of living for his mother's sake, at which end he hopes to go a euthanasia clinic in Switzerland. Can this really be, when Lou has started to love Will and he seems to being feeling the same way about her? This sweet, sorrowful movie will have its viewers in waterfalls of tears. Yes, there are moments of humor and fun, but, the tale is always a story of a wheelchair bound man, formerly very active. who struggles to accept his new reality. The cast is great, with Claflin, Clarke, McTeer, Charles Dance, and all of the others doing fine work. Mr. Claflin, who also appeared in Love, Rosie, will hopefully not be confined to roles in love stories, although his handsome face is swoon worthy. Then, the setting is superb, a lovely glimpse at a little known part of Britain. Louisa's costumes are ""sublimely ridiculous"" amid a well clad cast and the script, from a novel by JoJo Moyes, is carefully, poignantly written. Finally, the direction is somewhat slow, at times, but hits all the right marks for its presentation. As stated above, some viewers will not like the film's stance on euthanasia, as it strongly supports personal choice. Therefore, listen to this caution. However, most viewers, especially fans of romantic drama, will welcome the opportunity for a sweet, sad cry.",Me Before You,2674426
76,Bored_Dragon,"Enjoyable, if you do not think about what you see...",6/10,17 October 2016,"I've heard so much glorification of this movie, that I was eager to watch it as soon as possible and enjoy its magnificence, but then... disappointment on many levels. To be clear, this movie is not crap, but it's just slightly different from high budget South-American soap opera with Hollywood production.Acting is satisfying, scenery and landscapes are sometimes breathtaking and production is on the level. That would be all I can commend.Story... This movie doesn't have ""o"" of originality and it is predictable from the opening scene to ending credits. There's no single surprise or twist. Everything in it has been already seen and thoroughly verified Hollywood clichés are carefully wrapped in decorative paper.Will is a successful businessman from a wealthy family who ends up in a wheelchair after a traffic accident. On that fateful day, he would go to work on a motorbike, but his wealthy and beautiful blonde stops him. The same second he gave up on his motorbike I was sure what will happen next. While he was crossing the street on his foot he was hit by, you won't believe this, motorbike. Of course, in this type of story, the one in a wheelchair is usually male and rich and he hires someone poor to care for him. In the beginning, he is cold and grumpy, but in time he starts to show his warmer side. Am I the only one who saw ""The Intouchables"" ?! Slight touch of ""Beauty and the Beast"" maybe ?! Though here we have a poor girl that gave up on higher education to take care of her family, instead of a black petty criminal. She irresistibly reminds me of ""Ugly Betty""...Will's relationship with his blonde falls apart after the accident and she marries his best friend. His new caretaker is seven years in a relationship with egocentric sportsman until time with Will opens her eyes and she realizes she is not happy, so she falls in love with Will. The author is trying to catch us on cheap pathetic...Characterization is lousy. We see two-dimensional characters who are not well developed, not even close. How did Will win her love ?! What is that she falls for ?! Fact that he is good looking and rich ?! I doubt the author had the intention to send that message, but except for his looks and money, we see no other positive sides of Will. She gets money from his parents and organizes luxury dates and travels in an attempt to awake desire to live in Will... or maybe she provides herself a chance to experience things she could only dream about before she got access to his money... I understand what the author wanted to present, but also I cannot stop myself from seeing what's obvious. I did not make up any of this. I just point out the obvious.They go out, they travel exotic destinations, they fall in love. Will has a good time with his new girl, she loves him unconditionally, he is offered to get back to his job, his family provides full support, and he is rich. But that's not worth living and he decides he should kill himself. Yes, he planned this way before he met her, but not even love of his life can change his decision. What message does it send to us ?!That people with disabilities are useless, a dead burden to their surroundings, that they have nothing to give, professionally or emotionally, that good job, supporting family and true love are not worth living for ?! Somehow Stephen Hawking pops up in my mind...Sure, no one can stop you from killing yourself, but having a health institution to help you ?! If you are in continuous unbearable pain and your life comes down just to pure survival in endless agony... then maybe.But let's ignore moral dilemmas and stay in limits of this movie. If you already decided to kill yourself and nothing, not even true love, can make you change your mind, why the hell did you mislead innocent girl, give her false hope and broke her long term relationship, just to make her sucker at the end and leave her emotionally destroyed... That seems selfish and cruel to me.At the wedding, on the dance floor, he openly admitted that before his accident he would never notice a girl like her, let alone fell in love with her. And after the accident, his life is so worthless that even their true love is not worth living. Somewhere I saw that perfectly put in one sentence. ""I cannot live and love you because I refuse to live and love as any other man than the man I was; however, if I were the man I was, I would not have loved you."" But she does not mind.And so on, they fall in love, the time has come to go, she gives up her believing and needs and escorts him on the last voyage. The movie ends with an epilogue. He is dead and he left her with a fat bank account (and she did not even have to get married) and a letter that sends her to Paris, his favorite place on Earth, with detailed instructions where to go and what to look for. ""P.S. I Love You""... anyone ?!Don't get me wrong, the movie is more than watchable. After reading my review you would probably think that 6/10 is too high. But if you avoid analyzing, just grab your popcorn and sit comfortably on your sofa to watch the screen with half a brain, you will enjoy two hours of stereotyped Hollywood romantic drama, and maybe it will even make you laugh or cry once or twice...6/10",Me Before You,2674426
77,christian-larson,Best romance from 2016 so far,7/10,23 June 2016,"Me before you stars Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin and its the story of a woman (Emilia Clarke) and her story of how she falls in love with a man that cannot move either his legs and his arms. Emilia Clarke is amazing as her character, she completely became her character. I cannot think of another actress that will portray her character, well Daisy Ridley can because Emilia Clarke's performance did remained me of her. Sam Claflin was serviceable, he can easily be replaced. The story is really what drives this movie to the top. The relationship between Lou and Will is great, you really believe that they are in love. The music is used appropriately, only one time it annoyed me but it was once and it did not take me out of the film. The cinematography was great as well as the production design. The biggest problem i have with this film its is 3 act. It is really cheesy and makes the cliché that one person gets mad with one another, and you know they're gonna get back together and its just lazy writing. Its not awful but it ain't good either. Also since Emilia Clarke is so fantastic as her character, its really distracting when she is not in a scene, and you kind off get lost in the story. Other than that, I found that Me Before You was a great film about love, relationships and letting go. Beautiful visuals and an unique script made this film the best love story of 2016 (so far). 8/10",Me Before You,2674426
78,jharmon-19,Heartwarming and thought provoking,10/10,20 June 2016,"I saw this movie today and was not disappointed. The acting, especially from Emilia Clarke, who played Lou, was brilliant. I also thought Sam Claflin, who played Will Traynor, did a very good job. I note that someone has commented that it wasn't as good as the book. I disagree. There were a couple of small parts that were left out but they certainly did not detract from the movie. It has been a long time since I have seen a movie that I have loved as much as this one and would recommend it to anyone who wants to have a laugh, but also be prepared to have a cry as well. I also noted that, from an ethical point of view, someone gave it a one star rating. I find that very unfair because the movie was excellent. That is the person's view because of their religion.

Louisa Clarke is just the best character ever, seriously I don't think there can be a person who has watched this movie who doesn't like her she is just adorable. She is sweet and funny with a cute but very quirky dress sense. The relationship between her and Will is so beautiful and inspiring. This movie also introduced me to quadriplegia, a condition I had never heard of before watching this movie. It makes you think about some pretty deep ethical questions too.This movie was kind of like a much less cynical, grown up version of The Fault in Our Stars.

82,lyubitelfilmov,Smart Emilia taking care of a guy or touching love in difficult conditions,8/10,24 February 2020,"Melodrama. A film adaptation of the novel of the same name by the famous English writer Giorgio Moyes, known for her love affairs, she also made the script here, which pleases. I am sure that there are differences from the book, but I will have no desire to familiarize myself with the original source, therefore I will consider the picture as an independent work. So, Emilia, for the sake of you, I decided to watch - and it was definitely worth it. And here is my brief opinion - touching love in difficult conditions. I want to note that I did not find any minuses in the picture, although I watched it very carefully, trying to notice every detail, therefore I intend to dwell on the advantages of this film adaptation and at one serious point that it raises.
So here they are:
1. Outfits of Emilia - this was told to me by a person who advised me on this picture (well, because of Emilia), so I was ready for anything - but the picture could surprise me. I thought that a red dress would be the height of the creators' ingenuity, but it was only a seed before the parade of dresses, swimwear, blouses and other things that awaited me when watching. Costumers really tried their best. The craziest ideas came to life on the screen - and that's good! I literally enjoyed every outfit of Emilia. However, what can a nearly thirty-year-old Russian guy living in the provinces know about fashion!
2. Love line - here it is the center around which history is formed. It would seem that everything is simple - a provincial girl becomes a servant of a young disabled person chained to a wheelchair. At first, there is antipathy between them, gradually turning into love, and the real one. I saw many love lines on the big screen, and in this regard it is very difficult to surprise me. This line was not surprising, but the actors really tried. Emilia and Sam did not portray love, but loved each other for real. There is no falsity between them. The actors did not care, and this is the most important thing! Viewers appreciated this, and a picture with a twenty-million budget was able to raise almost two hundred and ten million dollars worldwide. People cannot be fooled.
3. Music - it is calm, creates the right mood, namely, romantic, a little serene, but gradually it changes to hopeless, oppressive and sometimes desperate. There are no catchy melodies, but I will praise the composer for his good work.
4. Camera work - a castle, a small town, a luxurious house of a rich man, resorts and so on are shot at a high level. Sometimes I caught myself thinking that I admire the views more than I read the dialogues (I watched a picture in English with Russian subtitles in order to appreciate the original voices, which I'm very happy about).
5. Euthanasia - the picture raises this difficult topic and answers it herself. I do not pretend to be the ""chief moralist of All Russia"", but simply express my position on this matter. I perfectly understand both the supporters of this practice and its opponents. But, starting from my worldview and education, I believe that life is a gift from the Lord, and we have no right to interrupt it on our own, no matter how hard it is for us. The Lord knows when our time will come, but how we manage the time allotted to us is already on our conscience. The hero of the picture decided so, but it is his choice. By the way, it was precisely because of this that the picture was criticized at the time, saying that it was ""propaganda"" and everything that came out of here, both here and in the West. Let everyone determine their position on this issue independently. And yes, I judge the question from a philistine point of view, but I witnessed several heartbreaking events, which I will not discuss, for the memories are still very fresh.
A little about the main characters:
1. Louise Clark performed by Emilia Clark (sorry for the tautology, but I'm not to blame) - a simple modest girl, in view of the difficult financial situation, is a servant of a young disabled person chained to a stroller, not yet knowing how this will turn her life upside down. The difficulties that Louise is faced with are more relevant than ever, even now in Russia, apparently in the West, the situation is similar, therefore the heroine immediately attracts attention. Her modesty and decency are truly captivating, and her recklessness and sometimes easy pretense - fall in love. I already talked about outfits, but I repeat that they're not simply lovely! The acting is at a high level. I was glad that she didn't laugh wildly in the picture, otherwise I would just finish watching right at this moment. Emilia knows how to show off talent when she wants. Amy's whole pen!
2. William Trainor, played by Sam Klaflin, is a young man, the son of wealthy parents, whose life was suddenly overturned by a terrible catastrophe, as a result of which he became a wheelchair invalid, his former optimism and confidence disappeared somewhere, his taste for life lost its meaning until he Louise met, which made him feel alive again. Sam really pleased me, he showed a controversial hero fighting on the verge of life and death, love and despair, grief and happiness. I have not seen Sam in any picture, but he played just fine. Well done!
I was glad to see the powerful Charles Dance as the father of William.
As for the tearful moments, they exist, but they didn't make such a deep emotional impression on me as the picture ""Christmas for Two"" did. I can't do anything about it. I was open to this picture, there was no skepticism (unlike ""Voices from the stone"", where it turned out to be true) - but there is no effect. Of all three paintings, only ""Christmas for Two"" could knock out tears (and already three times in a row). Many wrote that the heroines of Emilia in both paintings are similar, I agree, but only half. ""See you"" I liked it, but I'm unlikely to review it. But I understand the audience, who simply adore her and love her - that's great.
As a result, we have an excellent melodrama about touching love in difficult conditions with wonderful acting by Emilia Clark and Sam Klaflin, atmospheric music and a raised, far ambiguous theme.
My rating is 8 out of 10 and my recommendation for viewing!",Me Before You,2674426
83,MynameisJanetSnakehole,"Thought it would be right up my alley, but couldn't even finish it.",5/10,7 March 2017,"I love rom/romcoms. I love Sam Claflin. When I saw this trailer, therefore, I thought it would be right up my alley. I didn't read the book, so I went into this viewing with no preconceptions or standards to be met. I thought it was too bubbly, too cheesy/cutesy. Miss Clarke's crazy eyebrows shooting up into her hairline to imitate a look of bemusement, surprise, condolence, placation and everything else was driving me batty. Her little girl striped and polka-dotted outfits and her personality felt very contrived and forced, her moving from a waitress in a bakery to a home companion for a filthy rich family is out in left field, too. I just couldn't. I felt there was nowhere near enough chemistry in the two main characters to hold my interest enough to even finish the film.

85,PellyTelly,Lovely and heartwarming,7/10,6 September 2016,"The story is exceptionally moving and made me empathize Will and Lou very much. After watching a film one question has torture me: how is it living full life and then all of a sudden become enabled? All your life is separated into two parts – before and after. How do the relatives and friends feel when they see that person suffers every single day? It's awful and scary. Really, really scaryUndoubtedly, the movie is mawkish, though there exists a clear line between soppy drama and sweet girlish melodrama. Of course, there are lots of ridiculous moments and stupid dialogues, strange behavior, but everything is so harmonious that you may forgive all the flaws. Sam Claflin was brilliant. He coped with role easily. The actor managed to convey all the difficulties faced by the paralyzed people. Both moral and physical. Emilia Clarke was too eccentric. I realize that it was so according to the script in order to show her the immediacy and ease. However, as for me she looks far too sweet.In general, the movie turned out bright and pleasant.

To the rest of you, ignore it as well. Read the book. First of all, this is a beautiful film. Beautiful people, beautiful scenery, Beautiful beautiful beautiful! There's just one problem, Will's life isn't so effing beautiful. Neither is Lou's. Where Jojo Moyes uses humor to lighten up the dark of Will's accident, the movie tries to gloss over everything! It made me sick. Lou is so cute, but annoyingly so. And I understand that Will is supposed to be handsome, but the character-developing is flat compared to the book, and the whole point of their acquaintance is lost! A major point in the book is excluded completely! It's one of the things that makes sense to Lou's character. Jojo Moyes books are quite realistic, in a sense, because of her character's flaws. It makes you relate. Unfortunately, this does not come across in the movie, and there goes the humor, as well. I had to force myself to finish this one, as it felt like the movie was strangling me with cotton candy.",Me Before You,2674426
87,simontytgat99,Wonderful,7/10,30 June 2016,"Once again, Emilia Clarke does not disappoint. The acting truly was brilliant. Both on her part and on Sam Claflins part. The film reminded me of The Untouchables a bit. It was a very pleasant sight to the eye to see the bond forming between Will and Lou. Decent amount of humor as well, found myself laughing quite often in fact. It is nice to sometimes be able to empathize with the characters as well. I can't really think of anything negative at this point either. Maybe that most of the movie was kind of predictable. The ending, however, might not have been as predictable. I didn't want to go to this movie myself, but was asked to see it. In hindsight I'm glad I tagged along, because I did really enjoy watching it.",Me Before You,2674426
88,lisafordeay,I laughed I cried I really found this movie touching,9/10,6 June 2016,"Last night myself and my mom decided to go to the cinemas to see the new movie Me Before You. Me Before You is a novel turned movie starring Emillia Clarke and Sam Claffin and tells the tale of a young man named Will Trainer(Claffin)who has it all. His got a nice flat and a nice girlfriend,until one rainy afternoon his life would change forever as he ends up being paralyzed from the neck down and is confined in a wheelchair thanks to being hit with a motorbike. We later cut to a young woman named Lou Clark(Emillia Clarke)who is living with her parents and her sister and has an athletic boyfriend named Patrick(played by Matthew Lewis from Harry Potter fame). She's working in a coffee shop only to be told from her boss that its not working for him to keep her on in his coffee shop. So with no money to help her get through her life she goes to a job centre where she is looking for a job. Turns out this well off couple wants help with their son(who happens to be Will of course)and Lou decides to take up the position as a Career for Will.And from here on in you can pretty much expect what is going to happen. The two don't get along,they later start to become friendly with one another,and of course they fall in love. But will he get help with being confined to a wheelchair or will he decide to end his life ?Also starring Brax himself former Home & Away star Steven Peacocke as Nathan(the assistant nurse that helps Lou with Will and a brief cameo from Joanna Lumely,this touching romantic drama will leave you either laughing and crying or both. For mom and myself we both found this film very good. The acting is very good I liked the guy that played the young man Will he reminded me of James Marsden for some strange odd reason and him and Emilla Clarke had great chemistry. The music was very good and as for the ending, well I won't give away too much on the ending but I knew that it was going to happen about the 2nd half into this flick and trust me you will want Kleenex tissues after it. Overall I loved this movie and I was glad that I dragged my mom(who also wanted to go and see this with me last night as well).My rating is a 9/10 and I give it a 4 out of 5 stars.BVery good flick It actually reminded me of a cross between The Fault In Our Stars(one of my all time favourite movies ever)and that Julia Roberts flick Dying Young.

89,Danusha_Goska,Moving In Spite of Itself,6/10,26 June 2016,"""Me Before You"" was made to appeal to the lowest common denominator. In spite of myself, though, I was moved by and I enjoyed this film. ""Me Before You"" is a romance between a perky, poor, not spectacularly beautiful girl and a rich, suicidal, model-handsome quadriplegic. You may have begun gagging already. I understand, and believe me, everything that you fear may be wrong with such a film is wrong with this film. It talks down to its audience. Its play with dangerous ideas is a child playing with matches. And yet, I cried. I think two things save ""Me Before You"" in spite of all that's wrong with it. Sam Claflin plays the part of Will Traynor, the rich, handsome, suicidal quadriplegic. Claflin is young, ripped, and handsome enough to be in a toothpaste commercial. He is really good. I believed everything he did. I was right there with him. I felt his pain and desperation. Janet McTeer, a multiple-award-winning actress, is the soul of the film. She plays Will's mother. She is given very little to do, but she pops in and out regularly. There is an infinite sadness and terror in her eyes. I'm a former nurse's aide and I'm very familiar with dealing with family members of afflicted people. Janet McTeer is superb. She shows the exact strength, vulnerability, and hoping- against-hope of the loved ones of the wounded and doomed. ""Me Before You""'s plot doesn't do anything you wouldn't expect it to. If you go to the movies to be surprised or intrigued, stop right now. But you already knew that when you saw the movie poster of the perky girl sitting on the lap of the very handsome man in a wheelchair, as they gaze lovingly into each other's eyes. ""Me Before You"" takes place in the England that exists only in the imagination of fans of Masterpiece Theater, Jane Austen adaptations, and Merchant Ivory films. This is very much not the England of Sadiq Khan and Brexit or even of royal family scandals. There are very rich people who also have good taste. There are poor people who are warm, simple-minded, and humble, not at all resentful or bitter about their place. Sort of like Hobbits. There is sweeping, green countryside defined by rambling stone walls and trout streams. There is a big, fat castle – yes, really – overlooking everything. Weather? It's either blue skies, burgeoning lilacs and hydrangeas, or gently drifting snow outlining the castle battlements, or perfectly formed autumn leaves. Thomas Kinkade is the meteorologist. Louisa ""Lou"" Clark is a cutie pie poor girl. Emilia Clarke, who plays Louisa, telegraphs how adorable Lou is in every scene. She is constantly dimpling her cheeks and wriggling her eyebrows as if they were migrating caterpillars looking for a leaf to pupate on. Look, if you wanted to smack Emilia Clarke during every scene of ""Me Before You,"" could you please send me a Facebook friend request? Does the word ""subtlety"" appear in Emilia Clarke's dictionary? Or ""teamwork""? In every scene she demands attention. Actors should never work with babies, animals, or Emilia Clarke. Lou is supposed to be really poor. Lou never wears the same item of clothing twice. Her clothes are unique designer finds. Her shoes alone would go for a few hundred bucks. Oh, but she's this noble poor girl. Yeah, right. The filmmakers here keyed their film to teenage girls who love clothes more than life itself and who have short attention spans. My utterly subjective estimate: no scene in the film lasts for more than ninety seconds. You think there's going to be a serious discussion, or even three consecutive lines of dialogue, about the issues at play here: can afflicted people live worthwhile lives? Is suicide ethical? Will this film encourage the handicapped to off themselves? But that never happens. It's safe to guess that Will's quadriplegia is, to the filmmakers, merely a plot device. Tweener girls find guys attractive, but are anxious about real physical intimacy and all it entails. Also, tweener girls don't want to be obliterated by masculinity. They want to exist in a world where they are the center. And, tweener girls are anxious that they aren't pretty enough. Thus, ""Me Before You"" gives tweener girls a very handsome, ripped hero who couldn't engage in physical intimacy even if he wanted to. And he is so needy and so isolated that the tweener girl's cuteness and spunkiness and fashion choices become the center of his world. And she doesn't have to be beautiful to be the center of the universe to this handsome guy who, if he were not a quadriplegic, would be the hottest date in town. Yes, it is all pretty awful, right down to Lou's boyfriend, who is an endurance athlete obsessed with his physical performance, but insensitive to Lou's emotional needs – he is meant to contrast with the lovable quadriplegic. One man can run but can't feel. One man can feel but can't walk. Oh good grief. And yet I cried while watching this film. In spite of everything, Claflin's and McTeer's performances opened my heart.",Me Before You,2674426
90,yasiru1991,Not impressive as other love hits ..,5/10,4 February 2018,"First thing i should emphasize is , when you compare this film with Walk to Remember Me Before you really not up to catch that caliber.Film fails to attach the viewer emotionally during the play time. Story is distant from the viewer hence there will be no solid connection built between the film and the viewer. Story line is almost predictable , but so as Walk to Remember. But this story fails to add those tiny little spicy things to the story which will really really hurt the viewer at the end. Film ends but viewer will feel alright that he(Will) died but at any stage they did not want him to die. Director should create those small small moments which makes the viewer in tears when the character dies. Acting is not good. Its average from both Loise and Will as well, It may have cost the luxury of a good chemistry between them as well.",Me Before You,2674426
91,anonamix,A movie about 2 bad people that have a Fling.,1/10,21 August 2016,"I enjoy a good romantic comedy or 'chick flick' that tells a tale of complicated people falling in love in even more complicated circumstances... when those people are actually decent people. That is not the case here. Lou is in a relationship with Patrick, a seemingly nice and decent guy. He's active, fun, appropriately funny, ambitious, sweet, and he truly cares for her. They've been together 7 years! Then she meets Will. Will is a complete asshole. No really... there is not 1 redeeming quality about him as a person. He's dull... he speaks in a completely monotone voice the entire movie... he's not funny, not even a little bit... he's insulting... he's selfish... he's suicidal... he does nothing to even attempt to make anyone elses life around him better. The only thing that this man has going for him is that he is RICH AND HANDSOME. He even admits that he would want nothing to do with her if he was still able to walk, and this doesn't phase her one bit. We're supposed to give him a pass on all of those things just because he's in a wheelchair? No... sorry... just no. She falls for this guy and you could say ""oh, but he was sweet and he gave her compliments"" but NO. She clearly falls for him well before that. Everything she falls for is superficial. She loves the adventure... she loves the money... she loves the feeling that she gets from taking care of him as it makes her feel needed. There is nothing about him as a person that she falls for! So she throws away 7 years with a great guy for a fling with a rich and handsome asshole. WOW! And this was the movie that somebody decided to make. WOW!!! This woman deserves to end up alone and the only redeeming quality about this movie is that she is alone in the end and I can at least imagine that this fling that she threw away everything for will torture her for the rest of her life as she tries to find another rich and handsome man that can fill Will's shoes, which in reality she never will. This movie is a tragedy, not a love story.",Me Before You,2674426
92,whileyouareawaypetca-1,I want the two hours I wasted watching movie this back!,1/10,17 December 2017,"Ok, so this movie started out pretty good. I thought it was going to be the typical boy meets girl and falls in love story with a twist of the paralysis thrown in. NEVER did I think it would end the way it did! Awful!! Spoiled rich party boy winds up in a wheelchair and can't accept that his life will never be what it once was. So he selfishly ends his ""pain and suffering"" by assisted suicide, thereby transferring his pain on those who love him for the rest of their lives? What a terrible message to send to anyone facing trials of life! AWFUL!",Me Before You,2674426
93,new-life-41103,I cried until I laughed...how does that happen,10/10,3 July 2016,"First time I have written a review but just too say a movie has never made me cry so much that I started to laugh and every time I kept looking at the screen I would start balling again,I'm a 47 year old male who loves action movies and yet this film hit me like a grenade. I gave the film a 10 purely on how the movie made me feel. Emilia Clark was a joy to watch throughout the film,you were so believable to the point that when you cried I couldn't stop myself...if a movie can make someone react in this way,the film has done its job with entertaining an audience. I never read the book as I don't read books,so I saw this movie without any knowledge on what to expect.:)

94,themadmovieman,"Not an emotional tearjerker, but surprisingly enjoyable nonetheless",7/10,9 June 2016,"To be honest, I went into this film expecting a wannabe version of The Notebook that would frustrate me with cheesy and cringeworthy characters and romance. And, at least for the first half hour, that's exactly what I got, however the great thing about Me Before You is that it gets a hell of a lot better with every scene, ending up as a very enjoyable, if not generic, romantic drama.However, before I get into the best parts of this film, I'm going to start with the first act, roughly half an hour wrought with problems that I expected to continue on through the whole movie. First off, this film is a textbook example of a bad first impression, in the form of Louisa, played by Emilia Clarke. With the benefit of hindsight and her character arc, I can see that Clarke's performance at the beginning wasn't her own bad acting, but rather a symptom of simply poor writing and directing.As the film begins, Louisa is presented as a nice but pretty clumsy and dim young woman, who lucks into a job caring for the rich Will Traynor. However, despite all the smiles and brightly-coloured outfits, her ridiculous luck in the first act meant that she just wasn't a particularly lovable character for me, leaving me continually frustrated for the best part of half an hour.That, combined with all the inevitably cheesy and insanely generic chick flick tropes, meant that I had no hope going into the second act of the film. However, as the story develops, we get some great character development for both the leads, and, thanks to Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin's excellent chemistry, the film becomes very charming, pleasant and simply enjoyable.I'm not going to ignore the fact that the story follows an very formulaic route from start to finish, but what I really enjoyed about the film was watching Louisa and Will's relationship develop, simply because the two lead actors worked so well together, and gave very convincing performances that, especially in the case of Emilia Clarke, got less and less cringeworthy as the film moved along.Put simply, I eventually came round to really enjoy Me Before You. Despite an awful start, the film's pleasant and positive atmosphere, combined with Clarke and Claflin's fantastic chemistry, had me smiling and enjoying myself by the end. It's by no means the emotional roller-coaster of a love story it aims to be, but as a simply enjoyable and pleasant watch, Me Before You does the job pretty well.",Me Before You,2674426
95,aegairsoft1,A Dishonest Movie,5/10,5 September 2017,"Right away I felt something was off about this film. It had the actors, the acting, and the idea, and I couldn't quite describe why I felt this way. I was never sure where the film was leading me and couldn't understand the characters or their motivations. Overall it felt very confusing, that is until the climax finally came. After reflection I describe this film as entirely dishonest with its audience. This dishonesty kills the potential for that unrestrained cathartic ending we all were waiting for. Although, it did spur up quite the conversations and reflections after its viewing, it was not the types the conversations the writers clearly tried to push.
