0,yavoyavo,This is why you don't close your forums IMDb,10/10,12 July 2017,"Something is wrong when the downvotes are massive on a film with no real release. Then you realize its about the armenian genocide.... This could have been revealed in the discussion page rather than people posting fake reviews, but here it is, you made your page less informative because you were so afraid of trolls you ripped out and erased a basic feature for your site, you lost the ability to pick the brain of the world.",The Promise,4776998
1,isabelg_miranda,The overall rating is false: it's being down-voted by genocide denialists.,10/10,2 August 2017,"Well, screw those who would destroy History because truth hurts their feelings. The Armenian genocide happened, and whoever tries to censor this film will do so in vain, or so I hope.The movie is good, in general Oscar Isaac doesn't disappoint, and Le Bon adorably shines. That said, the crude, sad part is hard enough to watch, especially when you consider what's been shown is a mild version of what happened.It's a good movie, even though a ten is too much, I have to over-vote it to compensate for those who willingly down-vote in order to bury the truth in the sand. Worth to get to know what happened, if only because many wouldn't want you to.

2,michaeljtrubic,Wonderful Film,8/10,24 September 2016,"Many films that debuted at this years Tiff were based on unfortunate periods of history. I hope that some of them can learn from this film. This has at its heart a love story. It also depicts what a nation is capable of doing to an ethic group when its leaders (both secular and spiritual) reduce the value of life of different cultures to nothing if it is not theirs - Islam. This film is from the same director that brought Hotel Rwanda to the festival a few years back. That presentation was a wonderfully moving experience for me as this one was also.This film is not all about murder thankfully. Its about the people who were once a vibrant part of the former Ottoman empire that find all of their hopes and dreams for the future suddenly crushed. It has at its core a wonderful love story and it has attracted many fine actors to portray these memorable roles. I found the female roles to be particularly well designed and delivered. Excellent female roles in this film.FYI: At my screening (2nd) the director told us that there were 1400 seats at the first screening and that there were already 4000 negative reviews on IMDb - yes he reads these reviews. I don't believe 100's of Turks would come to a film festival only to learn about the Armenian Holocaust. No one at my screening cried foul. People that maintain it didn't happen are still trapped in a loop of denial. If we cannot remember the past we are doomed to repeat it.This film is careful not to delve to strongly into the depiction of violence. I think this film might be appropriate to teach children about history and also to teach children about people who want to cover up history.It is October 5th, almost a month now since the premiere. Currently 54,000 negative reviews for a film that hasn't opened yet - that must be some sort of a record.",The Promise,4776998
3,mamlukman,"Excellent movie--romance, action, it has it all",10/10,22 September 2016,"I also saw this in Toronto during the film festival. The director and main actors (except Christian Bale) were present and answered questions.The first question was the Turkish reaction--you can see that for yourselves: 84,000 ratings (low!) on IMDb BEFORE the premier of the film! Magic, right? Clearly the Turks are organized and out to sabotage this movie. 84,000 ratings don't appear without some organization, so I assume some government interference. Not very subtle.Like Dr. Zhivago (to which the director gladly admitted similarities), it is a love triangle set amid WW I. In this case, our hero is from a small town in eastern Turkey, an Armenian. He's about to leave for medical school in Istanbul, and gets engaged to another Armenian woman. Her dowry gives him the money necessary to pay for medical school. He befriends a Turk whose father is in the upper echelons of government, and he falls in love with another Armenian woman he meets at his uncle's house, where he is staying. His uncle is a rich merchant, and the woman is the nanny. But she is also having an affair with Christian Bale, who plays an American war correspondent. The Ottomans begin rounding up Armenians after they enter the war, sending the men to work battalions to construct railways and exiling the old men, women, and children to Syria. Our hero escapes and goes back to his native town, which so far has avoided problems. His parents want him to marry his fianc√©e, and he's in no position to say no, so he does, despite his love for the other woman, who is now supposedly out of the picture. But of course she comes back, along with Christian Bale. His wife is killed along with other villagers, and he flees to another village. They decide to fight rather than trek across the desert to Aleppo, where the Ottomans want to exile them. This leads to the famous siege of Musa Dagh, the rescue by a French fleet, and the drowning of the girl as they are about to reach the French battleship. So basically that's the story. It's plausible, well acted, and serves as an emotional entry to the horrors unfolding around them. As in Dr. Zhivago, the love story is necessary to tell the story-- otherwise you would have something like a boring fictionalized documentary. The historical facts seem accurate, despite our Turkish friends' protests. It's well worth your time and money.",The Promise,4776998
4,franknacsa,"Moving love triangle, leading to Armenian Genocide",9/10,13 September 2016,"Beautifully shot film, with intriguing intertwined love stories. Well balanced between the protagonists narratives and the inevitable lead-in to the Armenian Genocide, showing its impact on a very human level, particularly on the story's leads.Those who provide a 1 star of 10 clearly are not actually rating the film, but providing political feedback. How many who have rated it as 1 in 10 have actually seen the film? Doubt many have. Some of the rants are a clear attempt at revisionist history to try to rationalize the actions of the Ottomans. Sad part is that there really should be no need for those rating that way to do so, since Turkey (which I know is a denier) is not the same as the Ottoman Empire, and modern Turkey (though less modern under Erdogan), and Turks, should feel no compulsion to try to defend that Empire.Please use IMDb for the purposes for which it is meant, not to attack for political purposes. It would be fair, for example, only once one sees a film, to criticize it for being too political (though politics are worthy of expression in film), or too one-sided, and explain why, with examples.",The Promise,4776998
5,raffilalazarian,A great period piece about a forgotten genocide. Superb.,10/10,16 April 2017,"Dear IMDb, Yesterday I stumbled upon an article about a film called 'The Promise' and how it has received an unprecedented amount of negative reviews on your site. This film has been screened three times, one being at the Toronto Film Festival on September 11, 2016. And yet it has over 55,000 1-star reviews. How is that possible? This film is about a touchy subject for many because it centers around the time the Ottoman Empire carried out a genocide against the Armenian people. But since it is not possible that all these people have seen the film considering the simple fact that it has not been released anywhere yet, how can people leave negative reviews about a film they've never seen? In my humble opinion, it really questions your website's credibility. This film was produced by someone who had a vision and his name was Kirk Kerkorian. He put many of his earnings on the line to put this movie into production. The director, Terry George, is one of the most renowned and respected in Hollywood. The cast is made up of countless brilliant actors. This film has quality written all over it and yet it is being unfairly rated down by people who haven't seen it. It is a known fact that the Turkish government and people have been denying this genocide for over a century and are willing to go to great lengths for it to remain unrecognized. But to allow your website to become a weapon of Turkish denial and propaganda is not the standard that your company set for itself when IMDb was launched. Your website has always been a respectable portal of knowledge about all films of the world, so I am in real disbelief as to why a film that has not been released to the public is being defamed and down- rated by Internet trolls. As I said, this whole situation just questions the validity of IMDb. Please do not allow this to keep happening. There are so many people who dedicated their time and effort to the making of this film. They spent millions of dollars to make it happen. This film tells a story of an event that the world needs to know about. And until people have the chance to see it with their own eyes and in turn draw their own conclusions, please do not allow this kind of spiteful rating to continue. Please do not let your site become another place of hateful political ranting. It only does you a great disservice.""Was the above review useful to you? Yes No",The Promise,4776998
6,kaptenvideo-89875,Clearly an actors' movie and can be appreciated even if you don't care about history,7/10,17 May 2017,"What madness is this? I just arrived from cinema and although the summer season has begun they showed me a movie which is not: ¬ï some random French or Russian comedy, ¬ï a sequel, ¬ï a prequel or at least origin story ¬ï an animation, ¬ï based on YA novel or comic book¬Ö ¬ï based on a novel or non-fiction book or some older movie ¬ï there's not even any superheroes or mutants in it, ferchrissake! Set during the last days of the Ottoman Empire and their attempt to wipe out as many Armenian people as they can, at its heart there is a love story ‚Äì two guys (Oscar Isaac, Christian Bale) want the same girl (Charlotte Le Bon). The Turkish government would never allow a movie like this to be filmed on their home territory ‚Äì it's said that the Turks have never acknowledged the genocide or their role in it. So it was all filmed in Spain, Malta, Portugal and USA. It has a big budget of 90 million USD and that money is well spent. The movie as a whole looks old- fashioned in a good way: majestic and poetic, also a bit nostalgic for the past ¬Ñsimpler times"". The story is also old-fashioned in a good way, which is to say the approach is populist ‚Äì clearly black and white, we always know who the good and the bad guys are and nobody's choices are never questioned in broader context. But this kind of approach is not a problem when we have three leading thespians so able as Isaac, Bale and Le Bon. They put every nuance of the material to efficient use. ""The Promise"" is clearly an actors' movie and that's how it can be appreciated even if you personally do not care about that part of history. Some of the scenes with strongest dramatical impact are done even shortly and without any words, just a quick look, pause, and they move on. ¬ÑThe Project"" never dwells long on anything happening on screen, there's so much story to give and absorb in the 132 minutes it has. And yet thanks to competent direction and superb actors, it never feels rushed, there's always enough room for important things and people in the context of the story. I especially like the action scenes which are actually pretty small in scope, compared to most war dramas produced today, but it never feel that way. The suspense and danger surrounding the main characters is always real. I am not trying to step on anyone's feelings and underplay the seriousness of the genocide, but it can be said that the century-old suffering of Armenians is not the most well-known of historical tragedies, especially to the general English-speaking audience the movie is produced for. So having a big budget that enormous seems kind of risky. Luckily for the people involved, the project was fully financed by billionaire Kirk Kerkorian of Armenian extraction whose family had lived through the events depicted in the movie, and all the proceeds will go to nonprofits (ie, charity). A fun IMDb fact to end with. ¬ÑThe Promise"" premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival last September, but before the audience even left the theater, reviewers suspected to be Turkish government- sponsored trolls had submitted ca 4,000 negative ratings. That number quickly multiplied before the movie was released. Maybe that's why the IMDb score is pretty low, 5.9/10. All in all, it's a competent and confident movie from all involved. Even the main man behind the screen, the co-writer and director Terry George is not randomly chosen. His earlier magnum opus is acclaimed and Oscar-nominated ¬ÑHotel Rwanda"" (2004) about mass murder of Tutsi people in 1990's Africa. So it's like his second shot at the epic making glory in Hollywood. Here's hope the movie doesn't disappear unnoticed¬Ö although not having superheroes or even mutants is clearly a misstep!",The Promise,4776998
7,jtchagla,Overall great movie,10/10,2 February 2017,"I saw this movie at the Toronto film festival 4 or 5 months ago. It was honestly a very good movie. Christian Bale and Isaac did a good job acting in this movie. As a fellow Armenian, I am also disappointed in all the bad reviews that this movie has received. This movie is right now a 4.1 / 10 when it should really be closer to an 8 or 9 or at least a 7. This movie was rated before it even came out and it is not fair that it doesn't receive a fair rating. Overall this was a good movie. The music was well done by the singer of System of a Down and the director did a good job as well putting everything together. I would recommend seeing this movie for anyone who is out there.",The Promise,4776998

Sadly the atrocities depicted have been repeated in different parts of the world & we as a race have not learnt from this. The movie is faultless in detail & acting.

The acting was great, the period costumes and sets were flawless, and the story that it told was heartbreaking and needed to be told. I doubt there was a dry eye in the house (my wife and I certainly cried).

11,ma-cortes,Impressive and thought-provoking film about a love triangle set in the Ottoman empire during WWI,8/10,21 July 2017,"Extraordinary film correctly based on real deeds and set during the last days of the Ottoman Empire . It deals with a love triangle between Mikael Boghosian , an intelligent medical student (Oscar Isaac) , the gorgeous Ana (Charlotte Le Bon) , and Chris (Christian Bale) a renowned and brilliant American journalist based in Paris . Michael gets avoid by means of bribes to be recruited in the Turkish army ; however , the happenings break out and as he escapes , hides and flees . They are accidentally trapped in violent events when their family , friends and neighbours are massacred . After WWI bursts , all get worse . It begins the horrible genocide including rampage , and ravage in Anatolia which is expanded for the East . Armenians' slaughter is executed by soldiers and government officials . The journalist Chris gets into tumult and will shoot to show it all around the world . While Michael attempts to protect his family and the unfortunate refugees . Meantime , other refugees flee toward the far frontier to find shelter and attempting to get safety in Aleppo , Syria , to survive the genocide in Turkey . ¬®The Promise¬® follows a love triangle among a medical student , a sophisticated women and an prestigious American reporter . The film has an acid critic to the indolence of European nations and international community and specially , the abandon of foreign policy . Protagonist trio gives sensational performance , accompanied by a great support cast , such as Daniel Gim√©nez Cacho , Tom Hollander , Angela Sarafyan , Alicia Borrachero , Jean Reno , Rade Serbedzija ,and James Cromwell as Ambassador Morgenthau . The movie has a colorful and evocative cinematography by Javier Aguirresarobe , being filmed in 72 days across 20 locations throughout Spain , Malta, Portugal and New York. And a touching and moving musical score by Gabriel Yared . The motion picture was compellingly directed by Terry George who previoulsy made ¬®In the name of the father¬® (1993) and ¬®Hotel Rwanda¬® (2004)) . Terry was fully backed by the Kerkorian Foundation as well as an Armenian-American production company . Terry said : there's a difference between a perception of a story and the veracity of a story, we never wanted to dictate perception, just tell the truth . Rating : Awesome and above average . Indispensable and essential watching .The flick is based on actual events , these are the following ones : It's calculated that in the indiscriminate massacre were cruelly killed by Turks approximately 1.5 million Armenians . This brutal genocide against Armenians is called ¬®Armenian Holocaust¬® that was the Ottoman government's systematic extermination of Armenians , mostly Ottoman citizens within the Ottoman Empire and its successor state, the Republic of Turkey . The starting date is conventionally held to be 24 April 1915, the day that Ottoman authorities rounded up, arrested, and deported 235 to 270 Armenian intellectuals and community leaders from Constantinople to the region of Ankara, the majority of whom were eventually murdered. The genocide was carried out during and after World War I and implemented in two phases: the wholesale killing of the able-bodied male population through massacre and subjection of army conscripts to forced labour, followed by the deportation of women, children, the elderly, and the infirm on death marches leading to the Syrian desert. Driven forward by military escorts, the deportees were deprived of food and water and subjected to periodic robbery, rape, and massacre.Other indigenous and Christian ethnic groups such as the Assyrians and the Ottoman Greeks were similarly targeted for extermination by the Ottoman government in the Assyrian genocide and the Greek genocide, and their treatment is considered by some historians to be part of the same genocidal policy. Reports of the conflict reached then United States Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire Henry Morgenthau , Sr. from Aleppo and Van, prompting him to raise the issue in person with Talaat and Enver. As he quoted to them the testimonies of his consulate officials, they justified the deportations as necessary to the conduct of the war, suggesting that complicity of the Armenians of Van with the Russian forces that had taken the city justified the persecution of all ethnic Armenians. The Armenians were marched out to the Syrian town of Deir ez-Zor and the surrounding desert. There is no evidence that the Ottoman government provided the extensive facilities and supplies that would have been necessary to sustain the life of hundreds of thousands of Armenian deportees during their forced march to the Syrian desert or after . By August 1915, The New York Times repeated an unattributed report that ""the roads and the Euphrates are strewn with corpses of exiles, and those who survive are doomed to certain death. It is a plan to exterminate the whole Armenian people"". Talaat Pasha and Djemal Pasha were completely aware that by abandoning the Armenian deportees in the desert they were condemning them to certain death . Most Armenian diaspora communities around the world came into being as a direct result of the genocide.",The Promise,4776998
12,papazian-1,A dramatization of the first genocide of the 20th century.,10/10,27 March 2017,"My wife, the president of San Jose State University, and I were fortunate to see this film at a festival in our hometown, San Jose. It played to a full house and a discussion followed with the director of the film. Years ago, in the 1920s, an attempt was made to make a film on the Armenian genocide following Franz Werfel's powerful book, The 40 Days of Musa Dag. As many know, the salvation of a small band of determined Armenian survivors were saved from the Mountain of Moses (Musa Dag) on the Mediterranean coast by a French warship.Ihe salvation of the persevering few was an inspiration to the Holocaust resistance movement in Nazi occupied Europe and copies were passed around from one cell to another.Unfortunately, the film was never distributed due to the collusion of a frightened, anti-communists State Department fearful of losing Ataturk to the Soviet sphere and a determined Turkish government to deny the ""murder of a nation,"" as the US Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, Henry Morgenthau, term the Armenian genocide, a word to be invented later by Rafael Limpkin to suit the Armenian case.Turkish denial of the Armenian genocide continues to this day and the government of Turkey spends millions of dollars every year to hire lobbyists to influence American thinking. The thousands of negative votes on this film currently under consideration should be a dead giveaway that the Turkish government is once more active in trying to prevent the distribution of a film on the Armenian genocide. Furthermore, the Turkish government currently sponsored a film, The Ottoman Lieutenant, which gives the impression that all of the people of the Ottoman Empire in Anatolia suffered equally.The Promise is an excellent film bordering on greatness. I urge people to see it and judge for themselves.",The Promise,4776998
13,david-1161,Great film-a must watch,10/10,12 September 2016,"I had the opportunity to see the film during its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival. Going into the film, I had some misgivings regarding the love triangle aspect of the film. Luckily this was not a Michael Bay film and it was handled appropriately. I suspect the love story was created to make the film more accessible to audiences. The film is at times intense and emotionally draining with the horrific backdrop of the true life events of the Armenian genocide. The inclusion of some humor and romance provides sometimes much needed levity with such a difficult topic. Great performances all around but no one shines more than Oscar Isaac as the Armenian, Michael. It was disappointing to not to see more actual Armenians in a movie so entwined with the Armenian people. Of course Christian Bale is not American but plays one as he often does. Despite all of this, the actors and director created an emotionally engaging film. For the record, I am not Armenian but the film still resonated with me. While I have not yet seen Terry George's most critically acclaimed film Hotel Rwanda, I am now confident he was a great choice to direct. I only hope that this film gets the critical acclaim that Hotel Rwanda did, as it certainly deserves it. If you get the chance to see it, please do so.P.S. Don't be fooled by the inordinate amount of 1 out of 10 ratings. Hundreds of these were already posted before I even entered the rush line to see the movie in its first public screening. It's disappointing that people have to be so disingenuous with something as trivial as an IMDb rating",The Promise,4776998
14,sag-56298,A Must See Film,10/10,16 January 2023,"This is a wonderful film beautifully told with great photography and acting. It's not as easy film to see but it's a story that needs to be told and it's long overdue. It's interesting that a movie with Clark Gable was made about the Armenian genocide in 1934 but it was never released because of pressure by the Turkish ambassador to the US and the fear it would strain US/Turkish relations. As with all countries that committed genocide, there is a movement to cover up the truth. It's because of the shame and financial ramifications for owning up to what really happened. Aside from the historical disclosure, the love triangle the movie revolves around is very engrossing and dramatic in itself. It's a movie that moved me to do some research and learn more. The content will stay with you for days.

15,nandorueda,A powerful love story amid the atrocities of war,8/10,12 September 2016,"I had the fortune to attend the World Premiere of The Promise at TIFF and let me tell you, if the sustained standing ovation was a clear sign for the film's reception, then you can imagine how good the film is. With titles like Hotel Rwanda under his belt, Terry George is one of the few directors with the right sensibilities to handle themes of genocide with the right level of prudence and attention to detail required. With The Promise, he absolutely does not disappoint. The whole cast is simply wonderful but wow I want to talk about Oscar Isaac. I consider him to be a gift to film. He is perhaps one of the only men in Hollywood who can play ""ethnically ambiguous"" characters appropriately and gather attention. From what I've heard so far, the Armenian people think he actually seems Armenian. Oscar's charm jumps off the screen once more, but his performance also captures the character's raw suffering. More than once I got chills from the anguish presented, that's how good this guy is.I am curious to see the degree of backlash this film will receive, given how the government of Turkey has not recognized the genocide; although, I believe Turkish people should give this a chance. It also shows how there were Turkish heroes and victims caught up in the atrocities of war and they are not the real bad guys here: war is. The Promise may not reach Hotel Rwanda's level of emotional response and the film's length may discourage some, but its historical importance, remarkable performances and beautiful photography make it a title worth watching.",The Promise,4776998

Definitely states a lot about the Ottoman Empire times and a lot of history behind many cultures who are still strong in growth as of today across the world.

17,lorin-m,Oscar worthy,10/10,12 September 2016,"This movie premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival yesterday and today was the second screening, to overwhelming crowds. What an amazing, mesmerizing production, phenomenal acting. The crowd relived the agony of the Armenian people and felt like they were part of the events in the movie. The movie absorbed the audience by the sad events, love stories and the sacrifices of the people and transported us back to 1915. Bravo to the director and the entire cast for being part of history to make the whole world be aware. The director, the movie and the entire cast is Oscar worthy. History is repeating itself today in Syria because generations of people were lied to by their governments. Education is key ... not ignorance. Open your eyes and see what a handful of dreadful people did to those living on their own land.",The Promise,4776998
18,Coralknight,A Story That Had to Be Told...,7/10,8 November 2017,"...but that still hasn't been done justice. ""The promise"" is slightly better than its predecessor of the same theme, ""Ararat"". The scenery and settings, specifically of pre-War Constantinople are in fact, breathtaking (if not a bit fanciful). The story is entirely linear and unfortunately falls into trap of turning into a ""refugee"" movie, similar to ""Beyond Rangoon"", or the much more masterful ""The Inn of the Sixth Happiness""; where the protagonist enjoys a wonderful life until civil conflict forces them and a group of refugees to have to escape somewhere. I think the worst part about ""The Promise"" is the historical revisionism; The American Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire (played by James Cromwell) was indeed Jewish, but absolutely no ""Schindler"", in that he did absolutely NOTHING to save Armenians...not a single one. So, the movie has to invent a fictitious American journalist (played by Christian Bale) so Ambassador Morganthau can ""save"" him, somehow redeeming his role in the genocide, when the reality was Morganthau was the one who sat around and documented what was happening from accounts flooding his office while doing nothing.

Nearly three decades before the term genocide was even coined, from 1915 to 1923, the government of the Ottoman Empire (present day Turkey) killed 1,500,000 ethnic Armenians within their borders. Under the cover of World War I, the Ottoman government carried out mass executions, subjected able-bodied men to forced labor and drove women, children and the elderly on death marches into the Syrian Desert. As with any human tragedy, personalizing the story brings about greater understanding of the events that took place. That is what the drama ""The Promise"" (PG-13, 2:12) attempts to do, drawing its inspiration from historical events and adapting part of Franz Werfel's 1933 novel, ""The Forty Days of Musa Dagh"", the first book that brought the story of the Armenian Genocide widespread attention around the world.Mikael Boghosian (Golden Globe winner Oscar Isaac) is from a small Armenian village, but dreams of becoming a doctor so he can be of service to his people. He is engaged to Maral (Angela Sarafyan) and, with the blessing of her and her family, plans to use her dowry to go to Constantinople (modern Istanbul) to study medicine. Mikael promises Maral that he will return to her as soon as he graduates. In Constantinople, he meets people who would later have a big impact his life, including fellow medical student (and son of an Ottoman military officer) Mustafa (Numan Acar), American journalist Chris Myers (Oscar winner Christian Bale) and Chris' girlfriend, a beautiful Armenian named Ana (Charlotte Le Bon), who was raised in France and is serving as nanny to the children of Mikael's uncle in Constantinople.As World War I turns Ottoman society into a military state, Mustafa helps Mikael avoid being forced into the Ottoman Army, based on his medical student exemption. This deferment is short-lived, however. When Mikael tries to help his uncle who has been arrested, he himself is sent to a forced labor camp. Mikael escapes and returns to his village where his mother (Oscar nominee Shohreh Aghdashloo) urges him to take Maral and hunker down in a cabin in the woods, unaware that Mikael has fallen in love with Ana. Meanwhile, Chris is jeopardizing his freedom and even his life by steadfastly reporting on the military rounding up ethnic Armenians. The intensifying Ottoman campaign against the Armenians causes Mikael to repeatedly cross paths with Ana and Chris, as they all fight to survive, to help the Armenian people and, ultimately, to resolve the very personal issue of their complicated love triangle.""The Promise"" is a powerfully engaging and enlightening drama. The film's story is similar to that of ""The Ottoman Lieutenant"", which was released earlier in 2017, but ""The Promise"" has a more widely and deeply talented cast. It also has a better script, written by Terry George (who also directs this film and previously co-wrote and directed 2004's ""Hotel Rwanda""), along with Robin Swicord. As deeply as the movie goes into the suffering of the Armenian people, it never loses touch with the individual human stories which drive its plot. There's plenty of drama on the personal level, as well as in the overarching political and military realms. The romance subplot, which could have ended up sappy or emotionally manipulative in the hands of a lesser director, further adds to the film's impact. Although the ""promise"" isn't as integral as the title implies, this is an otherwise exceptional film. ""A-""",The Promise,4776998
20,areatw,Effective balance of history and romance,6/10,18 November 2018,"It's a shame that this film's IMDb page has effectively been hijacked by trolls because it covers a politically sensitive topic. Over 90% of all voters have either given it 1 or 10 stars, clearly attempting to sway the rating one way or another without actually watching the film and judging it on merit. 'The Promise' doesn't actually focus on the Armenian genocide itself, rather it is set during the final years of the Ottoman Empire and centers for the most part on a developing love triangle involving the main character.Looking at this film objectively and without joining the many others in disputing its historical accuracy, I thought 'The Promise' was an impressive and well-made drama film. The plot is engaging and well-constructed and is effective in balancing the telling of historical events with an emerging romance. It also looks great - the production and cinematography is excellent and it features some stunning scenery. Unfortunately the genuine ratings and reviews for this film have been drowned out by so many one-line one-star fake reviews.",The Promise,4776998

Would 100% recommend. Bravo to the director and producer, truly an amazing piece of work!

22,alliedrealtyinc,Don't listen to all the bad ratings!,9/10,12 April 2017,"I just saw this movie at the Atlanta Film Festival and can't believe all the negative reviews that the film has on IMDb. Were they watching something else? I found it very moving and very entertaining. Maybe not a 9, but considering all the fake ratings, I feel like I need to bump up the average. When I saw that it was over 2 hours, I rolled my eyes, but I was pleasantly surprised about how much it kept my attention and I was often on the edge of my seat. What was most shocking of all is the fact that I had never heard this genocide had ever happened. It's been buried in history, and I'm glad that the filmmakers decided to bring this to light. I met an Armenian woman at the screening, and she was in tears about how glad she was that the story was finally being told. The film is not perfect, and I have some issues with the love story behind it, but the overall historical perspective makes this movie a must-see. It'll open your eyes, especially in these troubled political times.

I cried not only for the great struggle the Armenian people went through, but the fact it is still not recognized by the Turkish government. Oscar Isaac is brilliant as we are passengers on his characters journey. The love story keeps you from being too overwhelmed by the atrocities being committed. It was really a great period piece, story and something we must never forget. I hope you will look over the negative and positive reviews and watch it for yourself.

24,robert-temple-1,A powerful and excellent film of the Armenian genocide in Turkey,10/10,7 October 2017,"This film, though containing fictionalised love stories, is otherwise based on true events, and takes much of its inspiration from the famous best-selling novel by Franz Werfel, published in 1933 as DIE VIERZIG TAGE DES MUSA DAGH, and in 1934 as THE FORTY DAYS OF MUSA DAGH. I have a copy signed by the author to his friend Hans Koerner (along with a copy of THE SONG OF BERNADETTE also signed by him). Koerner gave these to me just before his death because of my love of Werfel's writings. In reality, the defiance of the Turkish troops by five thousand Armenians on Musa Dagh mountain lasted for 52 days, though in this film it lasts for only a few days. The rescue of 4000 Armenians, many of them orphans, by a French naval ship shown in the film is based on the real rescue by several French naval ships in 1915. Werfel's novel was filmed in 1982. An attempt to film it in 1934 was prevented by pressure applied by the Turkish Government to the US State Department. Two subsequent attempts to film the novel were also prevented by Turkish pressure. The Turkish Government has always denied that the genocide of the Armenians took place, although everyone outside of Turkey who takes an interest in such things knows very well that one and a half million Armenians were brutally massacred by the Turks, men, women, and children, in cold blood. Werfel says in the introduction to his lengthy and complex novel (823 pages): 'This book was conceived in March of 1929, in the course of a stay in Damascus. The miserable sight of some maimed and famished-looking refugee children, working in a carpet factory, gave me the final impulse to snatch from the Hades of all that was, this incomprehensible destiny of the Armenian nation. The writing of the book followed between July 1932 and March 1933.' The American religious mission in the book is at Marash, and its head was the Rev. E. C. Woodley. What the novel really requires is a television series. Of course, Turkey will not permit its locations to be used, and THE PROMISE was filmed in Portugal, Spain, Malta, with a few scenes in America. The executive producer of this film was the famous billionaire film moghul and former Chairman of MGM, Kirk Kerkorian, an Armenian (1917-2015), who alas died before the film was released, aged 98. When Werfel's novel came out, Kerkorian was working as a manual labourer at MGM, a studio which he later bought and owned. Moving words by the author William Saroyan (Armenian-American) are quoted in the end titles of this film. I am glad to say that his daughter Lucy and I were close friends for a few brief months when we were young. She died much too young in 2003. Her first film role was uncredited in Karel Reisz's film ISADORA (1968), because Karel's step-daughter Kerry Kelly was her best friend and she was then (at the time I knew her) at their house nearly every day. Lucy's god-father was Marlon Brando, which became a good joke when he later actually became THE godfather. It should be remembered that not only the Armenians but also the Greeks were massacred by the Turks at this time. One of the most emotional films you could ever see deals with a Greek refugee boy from Turkey, modelled on the grandfather of Elia Kazan, who made the film: America America (1963, see my review; I slightly knew the actor who played the boy in that film). THE PROMISE briefly shows the visiting German military men who negotiated Turkey's entry into World War One on their side. It was the Kaiser's policy, based on an idea going back to the 1890s, that German interests could be served by whipping up Muslim hatred for infidels (all except for Germans, of course), and their massacre. Hitler did not originate this policy but inherited it. It was entirely under German influence that anti-Semitism took root in the Middle East, and the genocide of the Armenians inspired Hitler to commit genocide on the Jews, saying: 'Who remembers the massacre of the Armenians?' I am proud to say that my grandmother was a relentless campaigner for years for the Armenians and raised a great deal of money for the refugees during and after World War One. This film is excellently made, the direction by Terry George is superb. He also co-wrote the screenplay with Robin Swicord, and the script really is excellent. She has written many distinguished screenplays. As for Terry George, he was previously best known for writing and directing HOTEL RWANDA (2004), another powerful expose of massacre and injustice. He clearly has a social conscience worthy of an Oscar. The performances in this heart-rending story are very good indeed, with the lead young man, Mikael, played by Oscar Isaac with strength and conviction. Christian Bale once again masters the American accent to contribute a top rank performance as the American journalist who is trying to expose the genocide in the world press. The French-Canadian actress Charlotte Le Bon does not look particularly Armenian, as she should have done, but she delivers a sensitive and moving performance as Ana. Angela Sarafyan, on the other hand, who plays Maral, was born in Armenia and certainly looks it. When we see closeups of her face, we are looking at the real thing. She is now a successful American actress who has appeared in 60 films. Jean Reno appears briefly as the French admiral who saves the refugees on the beach. Tom Hollander appears as a former clown who has been imprisoned on a work gang by the Turks. This film deserves to be shown in every school all over the world, so that the truth can be known. Why should the Turks be allowed to get away any longer with hiding their dirty big secret?",The Promise,4776998
25,kamlis,Is this a documentary or a historical romance?,4/10,19 May 2018,"I think the film maker needed to ponder this question long and hard before taking his 100 million dollar budget and diving in. I chose to watch this film partly because I am a history buff and partly due to the strong leading actors. But it was immediately apparent that this film vehicle is not at all worthy of their acting abilities. At times it was almost painful to see how difficult it was for them to inject any life or believability into their characters. And it is very hard to connect emotionally with characters who do not seem real.Let's start with one of main characters - Ana. She is a French-educated Armenian governess for a prominent Armenian family in Constantinople. She is also having an affair with the American journalist. Now it is very doubtful that this affair was secret -- word got around fast in those days -- but how is it that her employer allows such a loose woman (this was 1914, after all) to educate his children AND even tells his nephew Mikhael that she would make a good match for him? Not believable. The other main characters could have been done well if they had been written well. But the film was so intent on giving us the details of the historical conflict between the Ottomans and the Armenians in their empire, that there really wasn't time to properly develop the characters. They were shallow at best and I just could not get to the point of catharsis. I usually cry in films depicting such tragic and moving events, but to my surprise, I did not shed a tear until the end when the narrator relates the wedding of Mikhael's niece and we read the words of William Saroyan.So if the intent of the film was to tell us all of the events of the Ottoman-Armenian conflict, then give us a documentary please! I would actually be interested to learn about why the conflict started. Was there a Hitler lurking in Anatolia? Or was it a bit more complicated than that? Or, if the film maker really wants to have a love triangle (or quadrilateral since there were actually 4 lovers if you count Mikhael's wife) AND educate us at the same time, please try a mini series. Then there would be time for character development and the sweep of history.The director of photography did not help this film either. Some of the outdoor scenes are shockingly bright and seemed very out-of-step with the subject matter. And the editing? I am no film-maker, but there seemed to be some very sloppy editing going on in the battle scenes especially. All in all I got the impression that this film was rushed into production. Why? I really would like to know.It is truly a pity that trolls posted 1-star ratings in the thousands before the film was even in wide release. While the film is of poor quality, I do not think it deserves such a low rating. But the thousands of 10-star ratings? This film is so far from perfect that the high ratings seem like a mockery. What, have these people never seen a truly well-made film?",The Promise,4776998

27,ferguson-6,Historic war atrocities and romance,7/10,16 April 2017,"Greetings again from the darkness. I've said this before, but mixing romance with historical war time dramas is fraught with peril ‚Äì it's a difficult line to navigate. Writer/director Terry George (Hotel Rwanda) and co-writer Robin Swicord (The Curious Case of Benjamin Button) have delivered a sweeping historical epic that is immensely watchable by not over-blowing the romantic triangle, the war atrocities or the courage and bravery of the main characters.The one-too-many lovers are played by the talented Oscar Isaac as medical student wannabe Mikael; Christian Bale as Chris, an American war correspondent; and blossoming international star Charlotte Le Bon as Ana, an American tutor based in Constantinople. These are three varied and distinct characters we accept because they have admirable qualities, as well as human flaws.Mikael marries a local girl (Angela Sarafyan who was the robot with hypnotizing eyes HBO's ""Westworld"") for the sole purpose of using the dowry to pay for medical school. His ""promise"" is that he will return and learn to love her (so romantic!). Chris is a hard-driving and hard drinking journalist who is not welcome most anyplace he goes and finds himself in quite a predicament with his job, girlfriend and life. It's not until later in the story that he flashes a caring heart underneath his armor of brash. Ana is nearly angelic at times in her goodness and with a smile that lights up the screen. Her devotion to Chris is as odd as her attraction to Mikael, but seeking logic in matters of love is often a journey without merit.The story is based around the time of WWI and specifically highlights the Armenian Genocide ‚Äì something the Turkish government denies to this day, referring to it instead as a ""relocation"" of nearly 1.5 million Armenians. The film began as a passion project for Armenian-American Kirk Kerkorian, a businessman, philanthropist and the once owner of MGM Studios. He raised the money and helped assemble the team, but unfortunately passed away just before production began. He would undoubtedly be proud of the finished film, and find some solace (if not humor) in the fact that it hits theatres only a few weeks after The Ottoman Lieutenant, a Turkish government backed project that purposefully ignored the atrocities and leaned heavily to a singular view of history.The cast is deep and included (one of my favorites) Shohreh Aghdashloo as Mikael's wise and courageous mother, Tom Hollander (""The Night Manager"") as a fellow prisoner of the Turks, James Cromwell as an American Ambassador, Rade Serbedzija as a leader of the Armenian resistance, and Jean Reno as a commander of the French Naval fleet that plays a vital role in 1915.Cinematographer Javier Aguirresorobe captures some breathtaking vistas and desert landscapes, while also delivering the intimacy and urgency of both the romantic and dangerous moments (including a spectacular rain-drenched train sequence). The acting is superb throughout, with Bale dialing back his sometimes over-exuberant traits, Isaac giving us someone to pin our hopes on, and Ms. Le Bon bringing the compassion to an area when it's so desperately needed. Expect to see her explode in popularity and respect when the right leading role comes along. Lastly, it's rare that I would think this, but the film's 2 hour and 14 minute run time might have benefited from an additional 10-15 minutes of detail towards the Turkish military strategies, and both the Armenian resistance and slaughter. It's a part of history that should be neither ignored nor glossed over.",The Promise,4776998
28,cruise01,The Promise focused a little too much on the love story and less on the tragedy.,5/10,23 April 2017,"When it comes to films with a tragedy event, it feels like it would always be a better idea to throw in a love triangle to help create a more dramatic experience. The Promise does that and failed, this time going during the Ottoman Empire and the genocide atrocity that many Armenian people were being murdered. It is a story that not many historical films went over. The film has an okay story, talented actors playing dull characters, and a direction that thinks a love triangle would be perfect for a mass tragedy war. The plot follows Mikael (Oscar Isaac), who lives in an Armenian village with his family. Studying to go to medical school and promised to be married to a family friend and in return his medical lessons are paid for. Once arriving in Turkey, he stays with his wealthy uncle, where he meets an Armenian woman Ana (Charlotte Le Bon). She was raised in Paris and with a journalist Chris (Christian Bale). Their relationship has not been perfect, when Chris is committed to his work and trying to be a heroic in exposing the truth about the war. Mikael falls in love with Ana, right before when World War I begins. Mikael tries to exempt himself from being enlisted to the military by stating that he is a medical student. When a round up, ends with him being caught and taken to a labor camp on building a railroad. Meanwhile, Ana and Chris are reaching across to help a group of orphans taking refuge in a missionary retreat to try to get out of the country. Especially, when Chris witnessed as the Ottoman army are taking the Armenian people and ""relocating"" them to a different area. Only to see that they are being executed. The plot was decent, and yes it is one of those historical films that go over the Armenian genocide. Which is something that is never seen before in historical films during the World War I. Sadly, the film also fails when they try to add a love triangle with Mikael already being promised to another for marriage but falls in love with Ana. Who is already in a relationship with Chris and their struggle of a relationship. Which she is frustrated for his rude drunk behavior at parties. We can all tell with the predictableness on how this all plays out. It really feels like they force this subplot of a love story in a tragedy event. Sure, other films work it out better like Titanic, Pearl Harbor, etc. Christian Bale is a great actor and Oscar Isaacs as well. Charlotte Le Bon is a beautiful stunning actress. There characters are forgettable. The direction is also dull and boring. Could have been better if they had a better music score to build the emotional tension. The most emotional tension we get from the movie is when Mikael notices the Armenian people he once knew, murdered in the forest. And that silent moment on screen was a powerful emotional scene. Overall, The Promise is a historical drama film that missed its mark on being a masterpiece when it falls under its love triangle clich√©s, dull written characters, and a boring direction.",The Promise,4776998
29,raph0711,Brilliant : A must watch for 2016,10/10,12 September 2016,"I watched this film in Toronto during the TIFF yesterday and had rarely been so moved by such a story. I am a French cinema lover who has always been touched by this terrible event of history (although I am not of Armenian descent) that has now happened more than 100 years ago and that is still denied by, in my opinion, too many people. After watching ""Mayrig"", (a beautiful film about the same subject matter made by Henri Verneuil ; one of the greatest movie makers in French cinema history) many years ago, I was hoping that other movies on the Armenian Genocide would appear on screen, especially bigger productions which could come out of Hollywood and have a huge impact on people's beliefs about the first Genocide of the 20th century. And now I'm to glad to say that my dream has finally come true. Indeed, the film lasted more than 2 hours and I don't remember having blinked a lot. I was so impressed by the cinematography, the editing and the music (not to mention the acting performances) that I couldn't see why I would give this movie something else than a 10. No words can really explain how I felt when the movie was over. After watching it, you can fully recognize that Terry George and his team did a wonderful job and that this masterpiece deserves to sit at the forefront of the Academy Awards. I highly recommend you not to be influenced by the current ratings that have probably been given by angry Turks and Azeris who still deny this horrible truth.

30,tigerfish50,Love amid Genocide,4/10,2 May 2017,"A love triangle set against the backdrop of the Armenian genocide in Turkey should deliver an intense experience, but 'The Promise' can't let go of its agenda as a propaganda exercise, which dilutes the dramatic effect. The lovers are Mickael, Chris and Ana - an Armenian medical student, an American journalist and a Franco-Armenian dance teacher, and the trio soon develop a tangled relationship. Their paths cross in Istanbul as Turkey enters the 1st World War, and the two males with crucial professions start competing for the favors of the party-loving Parisian.The story skims over both political and amorous aspects as the action zigzags across Turkey. The screenplay consistently portrays the Armenians as noble and courageous, while the Turks are mostly depicted as bullies and murderers. It addresses the issues behind the genocide only superficially when a Turkish official dismisses the Armenian community as a cancer within the nation. The romantic intrigues are given similarly shallow treatment, as Ana flits from one man to the other and back again, shedding a few tears on the way. The Armenian holocaust and the suffering of its victims deserve something far better than this lightweight melodrama.",The Promise,4776998

While the romance is beautiful and an obvious audience draw, it is the beautiful photography and the Oscar caliber acting by Oscar Issac earning my score. How sad is it no studio would touch this subject requiring the private funding of an Armenian billionaire?

33,erdal-eroglu,incomplete movie,6/10,13 July 2017,"I watched this movie recently with high expectations as I heard that it was top notch. I was disappointed - while its beginning is quite engaging and the story is of interest, it seems to me that the Script was focused too much on attempting to demonstrate the Armenian Genocide rather than tell the story of the people involved. All possible ""evil"" behaviors were shown such as work camps, railway wagon full of refugees, people beaten/killed in the streets ... It seemed far fetched to me. It seems like only Armenians were ""on the road"" at that time as the heroes only met ""poor"" Armenians and ""bad"" Turks. While Ottomans were a mix of Turks, Kurds and Arabs - focus is again on Turks only. Historically speaking, it is known that most murders were done by Irregular Troops. Having said that, one might say that this is not a documentary so inaccuracies may occur - but then this approach has made the film too much one sided. Not to mention the American behavior (journalist + ambassador) which is the usual ""we Americans do not accept this ..."" ... this came out as funny and removed credibility. I liked the male lead as he played well his role. He was one of the few strong points of the movie. One low point is for the ridiculous behavior of the leading Lady - imagine back in 1914, a lady sleeps with an American who is a drunk and goes around in bars with him, and is still deemed as honest and worthy to wed the main hero .... sorry, it does not make sense. Maybe for 2014 but not for 1914. So all in all - nice beginning, beautiful cinematography but then it tumbles as it wants to say too much and gets lost on the way. A weak version of Doctor Zhivago. Unfortunate ... Watch it once but do not buy it.",The Promise,4776998

Needless to say, I couldn't stop crying.
I can never understand where people get a capacity for such horror, merciless and senseless.

It is a must see for anyone that loves historical epic movies. The movie is beautifully written, directed, produced and all of the actors did a fabulous job taking the audience through their trials and tribulations of the characters that they were portraying. It depicts a charming love story whilst also shining a light on human rights, dignity and freedom that was denied to over 1.5 million Armenians during the Armenian Genocide in the year 1915. I encourage everyone to go and see this movie when it comes out in theatres as they too will be moved as much as I was and hopefully the take away message will be that factual history cannot be denied and should teach all of humanity to never let it happen again.

The reason we have refugees is because they are fleeing some place that is horrible. This movie tells the story of the Armenian genocide.

39,johnsonmmapleleaf,Absolutely brilliant!,10/10,12 September 2016,"Terry George has a history of tackling difficult subject matter, making it entertaining, and ""The Promise"" did not disappoint! I was fortunate enough to watch it at Roy Thomson Hall on its opening night, and the emotional roller coaster I rode on was worth all of the attempts to secure tickets. This was my first festival gala, and it is definitely worthy of my first review.The film is an epic, sweeping love story set against the backdrop of the Armenian Genocide. Michael (Oscar Isaac) and Chris (Christian Bale) compete for the love of the sophisticated Ana (Charlotte Le Bon). The lead and supporting actors deliver memorable and moving performances, and Marwan Kenzari - in the role of the humanitarian Turkish Emre - steals several scenes in the film. The family story-line, led by Michael's mother (Shohreh Aghdashloo), sets the stage for the drama later in the film. The film brilliantly weaves the love story, the historical atrocities without explicit violence, and the action and suspense of the films of yesteryear - only with actors who are absolute heavyweights and who also play superheroes.Although I wished that the film could have been a bit more detailed about the historical circumstances, it is just not likely to ever happen in 2016 for a commercial project like The Promise. The film received a thunderous ovation from the crowd, standing for several minutes with applause into the credits, and the film definitely fulfilled its ""promise."" People are going to be talking about this film for a long time.",The Promise,4776998

The fact of being media producer and professional screenwriter for the last 10 years of my life provide me a firm ground to state that this movie is a Piece of Perfection. If you are looking for a superb, beautiful, and moving adventure based on historical facts, ""The Promise' is a MUST-SEE! During somewhat above one hour the Director and Actors in front of your eyes unfold and call to life historical setting of World War I, ethnic cleansing of Armenian population from their lands, and the death agony of the sick man of Europe - Ottoman Empire.

41,goodfellas-89549,A Magnificent Achievement,10/10,29 April 2017,"Despite receiving a multitude of negative reviews prior to its release, largely from Turkish deniers, The Promise delivered a story and portrayal of historic events in a grandiose way that accurately portrayed the events of the 1915 Genocide. (Warning this review may contain spoilers). The brilliance of the film was brought to life by an A-list acting crew featuring Oscaar Isaac (Rogue One) and Christian Bale (The Dark Knight). The film follows a medical student through his journey from a small Turkish village to Constantinople and the vast outreaches of the Ottoman Empire, where he witnesses the atrocities carried out by the Empire first hand. The film explores the impact the genocide had on the Armenian populace of Turkey. The Promise conveys the scope of the brutality with minimal use of violence and a maximum use of facts. The viewer follows the story through the eyes of a witness and gets a feel for what the events were like. The production team did a marvelous job with bringing the events and places to life as there was a tremendous amount of detail within each scene. From the humble village where our hero begins his journey to the lavish marketplaces of Constantinople, the amount of depth and richness in each scene is nothing less than breathtaking. The story-line was entertaining and followed a simple love triangle, it did a great job of furthering the plot as well as encompassing the vastness of the events that were taking place, something of a juxtaposition but with minimal complications. I would highly recommend The Promise to all moviegoers, students of history, and agents of change. It is a beautiful film with a message for humanity to see everything that we are, everything that we're capable of being, and our capacities for savagery and kindness. All proceeds of the film are donated to charity and so, in viewing this film you are not only watching the events of 1915 come to life but actively making a difference in the lives of others to prevent such events from happening again, how many other films can do that?",The Promise,4776998
42,ikanboy,A pic without the E,10/10,23 April 2017,"I gave it a 10 not because it deserved it but just to spite the Turkish attempt to deny their own genocidal history in the ratings game. The movie itself is an average one that does the subject up nicely for public consumption but keeps away from any attempt to go deep. Many dozens of movies have been made about the Holocaust and precious few about the Armenian genocide. This one will tick off the Turks, but given the direction Erdogan is taking them (with their helP) who Shives a git! Perhaps it's biggest victory will be if it becomes popular and educates.

43,zinaaahmed,"A heartbreaking, educational film everyone needs to see",9/10,17 September 2016,"To start, this is not as heavily focused on the love triangle as other reviews make it seem. It is just taking you though the journey of these three characters who have a side story of loving the same woman.As a descendant from Turkey I was hesitant to see this film at TIFF but I'm so glad I did. It did just what the director intended: to make the audience feel the slightest pain of what the Armenian people felt. The main focus was on the many ways the Turks systemicly killed the Armenians and where it lead the characters. Between the beautiful directing, locations, cast and script, this was most definitely one of the best films I've seen. Please go watch it when it comes near you!

46,lee_eisenberg,we must never forget,10/10,23 July 2017,"The Armenian Genocide of 1915 is one of the forgotten moments of history. I learned about it by accident while reading a list of genocidal leaders (such as Hitler and Stalin) and it mentioned the Turks who massacred the Armenians. Indeed, Hitler was convinced that no one would remember his actions, citing the lack of attention paid to the Armenian Genocide.A movie that focused on the genocide was Atom Egoyan's ""Ararat"". Now comes ""The Promise"". Reading that the movie focuses on a relationship set against the background of the genocide, one might assume that it's a sappy love story. But it's not. It stays serious in its focus, showing how the Ottomans viewed the Armenians (some of the things that the Ottomans said about the Armenians sounded very much like what the Nazis said about Jews). The protagonist merely made a promise and sought to keep it no matter what happened. And some terrible things happened. To crown everything, the Armenians only got a small amount of territory after WWI and didn't even get access to Mt. Ararat (the Palestinians, Yazidis and Kurds didn't even get their own countries; that senseless war screwed up everything).An excellent movie. Terry George also directed the masterpieces ""Some Mother's Son"" (about the Irish Hunger Strikers) and ""Hotel Rwanda"" (about the Rwandan Genocide). Oscar Isaac and Christian Bale play roles very different from the ones with which they're most associated, with outstanding support from Charlotte Le Bon, Shohreh Aghdashloo (House of Sand and Fog), Rade ¬äerbed¬ûija (Eyes Wide Shut), Jean Reno (The Da Vinci Code) and Kevork Malikyan (Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade).",The Promise,4776998

49,jonathankplee,Armenian genocide story with love story and devastation,9/10,11 September 2016,"I just finished watching this at the TIFF Film Festival at its premiere gala. I found it surprising good story line about the massacre and genocide of the Armenian by the Turks. They do advise that it is a fictional story (including the made of love triangle).I like the love triangle between Oscar, Ana, and Christopher as it keeps some hope and interest as you see the devastation of genocide and war. But what people don't know is the movie has very little of Christian Bale in it, as he a reporter and has a minor role which is good. He didn't ruin the story, said his lines and contributed to the movie but didn't interfere with it.Oscar goes through everything and is a survivor, but if you think this is going to be a happy Hollywood ending or true love find each other, then wrong movie. That doesn't happen.Ana, I think is one of the best characters and is part of the love triangle and she makes it seem real. Probably the best out of all three main actors. She is beautiful, portrays the sense of innocence, deeply in love and willing to help people, and you want her to be happy and survive, but war and genocide doesn't let that happen.Not too sure why its a 4.3 because I was the first to see it and paid $100 for the premiere. I found it pretty good.P.S. If they shot Christian Bale in the first 30 seconds for being a drunken idiot, probably wonder have made no difference in the movie! Ana didn't show up for the premiere and Christian Bale didn't do any Q&A, so waste of my $100.",The Promise,4776998

The movie and the director received two standing ovations from the large audience, one at the start of the Q & A, the other at the end of it. A great historical drama and love story.The vast majority of those giving this film low ratings did not see the film (only a few thousand people have seen it so far, as of the end of September 16, 2016). The reason the vast majority of them are giving the film low ratings is because they do not want people to go to film that is in part about the Armenian genocide carried out by the Turkish government during WW1.

56,Molongirl,So many reviews reek of denial!,9/10,30 July 2017,"I am so glad The Promise finally brings to the screen the story of the Armenian genocide by the Turkish government during World War 1. This is a long overdue telling of a part of world history that has badly needed airing. I admit to over rating the film in order to counteract the very obvious political bias of many of the low reviews. I would actually rate it overall as an 8, (needed a bit more editing) but 10 for the topic and acting etc. It is very well worth while seeing, a good film.The statement at the end of the film that the Turkish government denies the genocide to this day is echoed heavily in many of the very low scoring reviews here on IMDb. These supposed reviews are reminiscent of a child stamping its foot and saying ""how dare you"", rather than any serious discussion of the film. It makes you worried for the future of modern Turkey when it can't accept and learn from its past history, something at least Germany, with so many more deaths on its hands, has done admirably. Perhaps the young Turkish friend of Mikael could be held up as someone to admire, he saved his friends lives at the cost of losing his own, a truly courageous act in a time of barbarity. The movie, is well written, acted and filmed. The story mainly unfolds to us from the perspective of a young Armenian man Mikael who wants to become a doctor; Oscar Isaac's performance as Mikael is wonderful, the scene where he finds his slaughtered family is incredibly moving, the display of raw, naked grief and loss its almost unbearable. Christian Bale's performance as the world weary AP reporter, is great. His character, becoming aware of the atrocities happening around him, turns from drunken cynic to courageous truth teller, revealing to the world the systematic, cruel elimination of the Armenians. Charlotte le Bon created an Ana so full of life and hope, a candle of kindness to the children in a dark place, that she was a joy to watch. I can't think of one character who didn't ring true, all were very good. I did enjoy Jean Reno's very brief appearance as the French admiral coming to the rescue.A highlight is a scene in a cathedral of a man singing which strangely to me was the most powerful moment in the whole film, I have no idea what he was singing but something beautiful and hopeful and truthful echoed in that building and in the song. Overall an emotionally draining story well told.",The Promise,4776998

Together they form a wonderful movie, sad but uplifting at the same time.There are many 1* reviews which seem to be the work of deniers - Turkey still refuses to acknowledge the crime of genocide - but it still scores quite highly on IMDB.

59,rannynm,Exotic and informative,9/10,13 April 2017,"I am definitely going to watch this film again. It is so exotic because it is based on the Ottoman Empire, which not every kid is entirely aware of. The school subject I dislike most is history, but after seeing this film, my mind is forever changed because I am fascinated about how much goes on in the world. The Promise is set in the Ottoman Empire, in Armenia, the eastern part of the Ottoman Turkish Empire. Mikael Pogosian (Oscar Isaac) is a young, Armenian medical student who recently married in order to receive an endowment to pay for medical school. He leaves for Istanbul to further his studies. In the midst of his medical endeavors World War 1 breaks out and Armenia is deeply involved in it. When he travels to Istanbul, a mass Armenian genocide is initiated and he has to overcome these obstacles with Ana (Charlotte Le Bon), a woman he begins to fall in love with. Since her husband, Chris Myers (Christian Bale) is not too happy, a love triangle begins to form. Pogosian and Le Bon work together to keep everyone safe and try to leave Turkey and go to the United States. Oscar Isaac (Mikael Pogosian), the protagonist, puts others first and acts solely on instinct, which is a great quality to possess. Ana (Charlotte Le Bon) has a kind heart and desires to save all of the Armenian children. Chris Myers (Christian Bale) is a reporter for the Armenian genocide and takes great pride in his work. The budget for this film must have been very large because there are hundreds of weapons utilized, many explosions and gunshots and many buildings destroyed. I love that the men ride on horses because horses are one of my favorite animals. It reminds me of history class because, in the past, soldiers rode on horseback. My favorite part of the film when Ana is teaching Pogosian how to dance with her cousins and Pogosian's cousin walks in. There is complete silence. Not many men dance, so it is entertaining to watch. The message of this film is to be informed about the past and to appreciate all that you have. Living in America, I feel fortunate to be safe and could not imagine what people in countries such as Armenia and Turkey have gone through. I rate this film 5 out of 5 stars. Since there are many casualties and gory scenes, I recommend this film to children ages 16 to 18 and think adults will enjoy it too. This movie changes how I think. I learned so much from it.

60,cooledbeans,Amazing movie,10/10,28 October 2016,"Masterpiece and finally recognition for the poor Armenian people. It's disturbing how Turkey has been so filled with propaganda that they would deny the events. It's like saying America never nuked japan or that the Germans never committed war crimes against the Jews. You cannot believe the Turkish reviews claiming it's all a lie. It's just disgusting that they deny all of it. How insane do you have to be to even believe that. It's all Erdogans fault.That said, the movie itself was incredibly touching. Amazing soundtrack, amazing acting and amazing directing. It's a very emotional subject to begin with but this just made it that much more emotional. The Armenians might find some redemption in this. I deeply empathize with them.

You may have heard these stories from survivors, grandparents, or teachers. You may have learned about the genocide from history, museums, and churches. But to see a part of the story on screen in Hollywood style brings some sense of justice, as if to say, the truth has been finally revealed.

64,cwjohnsonjr,Classic Historical Drama That Avoids Sappiness,10/10,23 April 2017,"The Promise is epic, sweeping, beautiful, emotional, heartbreaking and eye opening - this is why we go to the movies! Yes, it has a love triangle, but it avoids the cheesiness and modern soap opera feel that so often befalls historical films that use that trope for human interest. All the actors are at the top of their game. The cinematography is gorgeous and the CGI establishing shots are believable. This is an Oscar worthy film. The Promise will do for The Armenian Genocide what Schindler's List did for The Holocaust. If you are a fan of films like Hotel Rwanda, Defiance, 12 Years A Slave or Flowers of War, you'll love The Promise.

I had no prior idea about the existence of this movie,I just happen to go the theater and saw the trailer in the lobby. It looked interesting and so I decided to see it... And I am glad I did. This film is so emotional and well acted. You could very well relate to the feelings of Mikael, the lead character. Near the end, I felt the overwhelming heaviness in my heart that left me speechless and emotionally drained. Fortunately the movie ended in a positive note. I don't believe this movie deserves the current rating of 6, it deserves higher, if not 10.

It is a story that should not be ignored, the time period and events were atrocious and hard as the Turks try to cover and deny they fail miserably. Great acting by Christian Bale and the Iranian lady. Writing is good, story good, production good. With all the movies that are made and compared to how many are actually seen by MANY, this is one that should be considered for an Academy Award and actually seen by the masses (at least if they care about atrocities committed by mankind on a regular basis, unless they are hypocrites and just drop crocodile tears.)

68,Leofwine_draca,"Yes, it happened",6/10,21 January 2018,"THE PROMISE is a would-be historical epic in the Hollywood mould, seemingly inspired by the look and feel of the likes of THE ENGLISH PATIENT. The main story tells of a love story between a beautiful woman, a medical student, and a journalist, but this merely exists in order to depict one of the most controversial events of the 20th century: the massacre of the Armenians by the Turks. Turkey continue to deny that such a genocide ever took place - indeed, for them, this film is a work of fiction, a piece of western propaganda at best. Nonetheless it's shocking, moving, and harrowing, particularly in the latter half of the production. The romantic stuff I could have done without, but there's no denying that this is the kind of story that needs to be told, and Isaac, Bale, and Le Bon are up to the telling.",The Promise,4776998

70,latinfineart,A very moving film- very good historical account,9/10,30 July 2017,"Not sure why there were so many negative reviews. Perhaps the entire Turkish community is voting this film down. Rather an embarrassment for them. This depiction of one of the greatest crimes against humanity, ever committed, is a powerful tribute to a lovely people, who were persecuted mercilessly by the Turks, who found themselves on the wrong side of history, during this great war. Though the persecution started long before the atrocities committed during WWI, it was all done while labeling the Armenian traitors. Well, who would not stand up to this kind of mindlessness? Somewhere between 600,000 and 1.5 million Armenians were slaughtered, out of a total population of 2 million! Good job guys. Way to go. A resounding success. Thankfully the French Navy intervened, and saved quite a number of people. The Americas never got involved, or course, until the last year of the war. While the extent of the Ottoman Empire was, by 1914, somewhat reduced (in the past it had included large parts of North Africa, South Eastern and Eastern Europe, the Middle East and the Arabian peninsula), its territory still spanned large parts of the Middle East and Arabia, which came to be heavily affected by the First World War. It seems that part of the attempted annihilation of the Armenian people, was at least partly due to the tremendous sense of diminishment the Turks felt, by this point in time, as their empire crumbled around them. Regardless, it was inexcusable on any level. The film was very well done. Great acting, by both the lovely Charlotte LeBon, and the great actor, Oscar Isaac. And as usual, Christian Bale was amazing. The direction was excellent, as was the score, the cinematography, and the editing. This film just did not get the credit it deserved.",The Promise,4776998
71,em-chandelier,Great story within the frame of a terrible historical event,10/10,16 July 2017,"A great film, a great scenario, great actors. Moreover, the film approaches very directly and very faithfully the topic of the Armenian genocide committed by the Turks, and not admitted by the Turkish state so far. Beyond the tragic history of the characters involved, I think the film manages to carry along the hope the animated the Armenian survivors i.e. being good is most important, no matter how challenging the circumstances may be. The love story woven in the macro-historical narrative only shows and tells the story of so many people who drowned in history without having told their story. If you want a truly great film, and also learn about the denied history of the Armenian genocide hidden for a century, watch this film, but be prepared to cry.

Had no idea of the extent of this WWI history, most know of WWI and the Gallipoli Campaign this gives one a different look at the role the Turks acted and performed.Well played and lot of drama and action.Insight: In 1915, leaders of the Turkish government set in motion a plan to expel and massacre Armenians living in the Ottoman Empire. Though reports vary, most sources agree that there were about 2 million Armenians in the Ottoman Empire at the time of the massacre. By the early 1920s, when the massacres and deportations finally ended, some 1.5 million of Turkey's Armenians were dead, with many more forcibly removed from the country. Today, most historians call this event a genocide‚Äìa premeditated and systematic campaign to exterminate an entire people. However, the Turkish government does not acknowledge the enormity or scope of these events. Despite pressure from Armenians and social justice advocates throughout the world, it is still illegal in Turkey to talk about what happened to Armenians during this era.",The Promise,4776998

I'm excited for this movie to come to the big screens for everyone to get the chance to learn about a part of history that is over looked and not talked about. It makes me sick all the negative reviews this film is getting by Turks who are too brainwashed to know and accept what really happened over 100 years ago. I really hope that this movie will be able to make it to the big screens and not push forward like so many other movies about the Armenian Genocide.

77,Hellmant,I definitely agree that film critics didn't give it enough credit.,8/10,26 July 2017,"'THE PROMISE': Four Stars (Out of Five) A historical drama set in the last years of the Ottoman Empire, right before the Armenian Genocide. It involves a love triangle between an Armenian medical student, an American journalist living in Paris, and an American-born woman raised in France. The film stars Oscar Isaac, Christian Bale and Charlotte Le Bon. It was directed by Terry George, and written by George and Robin Swicord; George has previously co-written such critically acclaimed historical dramas as 'IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER' and 'HOTEL RWANDA' (which he also directed). The film was made on a budget of $90 million, and it was completely funded by an American businessman of Armenian origin (named Kirk Kerkorian). It's received mixed reviews from critics, and it bombed at the Box Office, but the point of the movie was to bring attention to that horrific time (and place) in history (not to make money the studio says). There's also been controversy that Armenian Genocide deniers sabotaged ratings on IMDb, in an attempt to discredit the movie, and even the critics themselves have been criticized for not giving the film enough credit. I definitely agree that film critics didn't give it enough credit.Isaac plays Mikael, an apothecary living in a small Armenian village, called Sirun, in the southeast Ottoman Empire. In order to gain funds for medical school, he promises himself (in marriage) to the daughter of his neighbor. With the dowry he receives, Mikael enrolls in the Imperial Medical Academy (in Constantinople). There he befriends a Turkish classmate, named Emre (Marwan Kenzari), and an Armenian woman, who was raised in Paris, named Ana (Le Bon). Ana is dating an American reporter, for the Associated Press, named Chris Meyers (Bale). A love triangle then develops between Mikael, Ana and Chris (even though Mikael is promised to another), right before World War I breaks out (and Armenian Genocide). The three also become tragically involved in that horrific atrocity.The film is really well produced (it's budget definitely shows) and acted (especially Isaac and Bale). It's very reminiscent of classic epic war movies from years ago. The love triangle romance may seem unnecessary to some, but I don't think it was overdone at all. The movie is also really educational, for people like me at least (that don't know anything about that time in history). I think the filmmakers definitely accomplished what they set out to do with the film. It's not a 5 star masterpiece in my opinion, but it is a really good film.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://vimeo.com/226937840",The Promise,4776998

A good historical movie like this one can enable people to have a better understanding of historical events. I did a little research after watching it and it turns out what is shown is historically accurate, including the forced march of the Armenian people into the desert and the involvement of French marines.The acting, direction and cinematography are excellent. Christian Bale is one of the best of his generation. Charlotte Le Bon and Chris Isaac performed very well, and it was nice to see quality actors in supporting roles, such as Jean Reno as the captain of the French ship and James Cromwell as the American ambassador.It's sad that more people didn't go to see it, they wouldn't have been disappointed and they would have had an important history lesson.",The Promise,4776998

The Turkish government tried all it can to prevent this from happening, but the persistence of the Armenian people prevailed. The modern Turkish Government will hate any reference to a genocide that is depicted by this movie. Genocide did happen to Armenia‚Äãns, Greeks, Assyrians and other minorities. Hitler knew that Turkey ""got away with"" this genocide, so he was emboldened to act in the way he did. The gruesome reality of the Ottomans' barbarism was toned down to make the movie more palatable to sensitive audiences with a PG rating. This is a victory for good over evil. Justice has been denied the Armenians for 102 years but this movie brings us one step closer to bringing the truth to a world obsessed with comic book escapism and cell phones distraction. There is no statute of limitations on the truth. A great movie. Everything from the story line and its backdrop, the attempted genocide of the Armenians by the Young Turks, the acting (Specially Oscar Isaac and Christian Bale were phenomenal), the cinematography, they were all great. A must see for everyone.

84,zoeisabella-89387,The Promiseüá¶üá≤,10/10,14 August 2020,"As an Armenian-American teenager, I am very aware of the atrocities committed by the Ottoman Empire against my ancestors. But still, seeing it portrayed in a film like this brought tears to my eyes. I loved the music especially. It is so important for people to see this film, especially non-Armenians. For too long the horrors of the Armenian genocide have been ignored and denied and under-documented. To this day, Turkey does not admit responsibility. This film is proof that the Armenian people will never stop fighting for justice for our ancestors. So please, if you are considering watching this film, do so. Whenever I recognize an Armenian last name in a film I always get excited, but actually seeing a film about my people (albeit very Hollywood-esque, understandably so) makes me proud to know where I come from. A strong, resilient country, that will never disappear, no matter how hard you try. That is our promise.

85,mcmiller53,6.1 Rating? Really?!,10/10,7 March 2019,"This is a fabulous movie about the Armenian genocide during WW1. I'm ashamed to say that I knew little about this scar on our human history and am grateful to the makers of this film to lead me to learning more.I'm baffled by the low rating but some reviews have given me their reasonings and can only accept them as accurate. Nothing else than genocide deniers makes sense because the movie itself is beautifully filmed, acted and the plot well constructed.Maybe I'm wrong but thoroughly enjoyed this remarkable and award-worthy piece of film.

86,kgengler-02377,Excellent film,10/10,9 July 2023,"A true story. Forgotten or purposely overlooked because it doesn't support a political narrative. The actual fact based happenings were much ,much worse then depicted. Another historical truth the Marxists don't want to see the light of day. It is such a travesty that everything's viewed through a political prism now. When we are talking about actual occurrences, only the acceptable story lines are to be acceptable and verifiable. What a shame. The left has black listed this film along many others. They include "" the free state of Jones "", the Passion of the Christ and "" For the Glory of God, just to name a few.

87,muluselll,History is never one- sided,10/10,2 November 2016,"As a Turk I was told that Armenian Genocide was a lie. After some research I couldn't actually find any proof to suggest it as well and what we learned made more sense than the genocide. Anyway lie or not I don't think voting bad to prevent this movie to go big screen is just useless. Yes this may be just propaganda but history is never one sided so let people learnsomething from it. The best way to show evidence to millions is by movies and us blocking it just makes us look bad. I didn'tlike the movie but we should let it be seen otherwise it's just censoring for no reason.

88,johportokal,Raw truth!!,10/10,11 October 2017,"This review is addressed only to non biased readers. The film is an exact depiction of historical facts occurred during WWI within the territory of the then crumbling Ottoman state (I am not considering it Empire as it had lost his vast lands by that time). Turkish government of that era conducted a genocide towards the Armenian population (exterminating around 1.5 million Armenians. Simultaneously their genocidal behavior was extended to other non Turkish minorities residing within the nowadays Turkish state. One other major genocide that happened at the same chronological period was the Pontian genocide (Greek natives of the Black sea shores of Turkey called Pontians). The Turks were successful in killing almost 1 million of Pontians, while achieved to depose a vast number of them to other neighboring state of the Black Sea. Both the Armenian Genocide and the Pontian Greek Genocide are denied by the governments of Turkey until today. I am really glad this film has achieved to include both the pogroms in Constantinople (Instabul nowadays) against Armenians, the working camps, deportation methods and extermination tactics that even AXIS nations imitated during WWII. The acting by Oscar Isaac, Christian Bale, and Charlotte Le Bon was of high standards, while I will not forget to mention the minor roles played by major Hollywood actors like Tom Hollander, Jean Reno, and James Cromwell. Overall, it is a film worthy of the money and effort, worthy to be watched, while it will leave the viewer with feelings of sympathy, empathy, anger, and a lack of justice (unfortunately for the last). Highly recommended to watch!!",The Promise,4776998
89,adkmtser-64644,The Turkish Government has still not apologized,10/10,8 August 2018,"I flipped past this film on many occasions, judging by the inaccurate or stealth description, that the main topic was a love triangle ""amidst the breakdown of the Ottoman Empire."" As many reviewers have noted, the subject of this film is the Armenian Genocide by the Turkish government during World War 1. And to this day, the Turks have not apologized or owned up to the facts. And, under the present ruler, no honest appraisal will be forthcoming from Turkey. Finally, the story has been told, and it needs to be heard.

90,prg-3,Political tampering,8/10,23 April 2017,"All readers of the IMDb page for ""The Promise"" should be informed as many as 90,000 Turks have posted purely political, one-star ratings for this film since its first film festival showing. If possible, this should be rectified by IMDb. In other words, the present rating is political not theatrical - it is bogus.

91,curly999,False reports on IMDb.,10/10,21 April 2017,"How can there be 123,000 votes for a film that hasn't even opened in US or UK until today? Over 50K low scores. It leads one to believe this is rigged and set-up to deceive those who are here to read valid reviews. Allowing this type of voting does not do any service to the credibility of IMDb. I saw the film today and found it to be excellent: history, love story, human and the social impact of it. I didn't know anything about the early 20th century Ottoman murders of Armenians, Greeks and Assyrians. Powerful film...

92,narkirakosyan,Best movie,10/10,14 January 2017,"Honestly one of the best movies i have seen this year. Such a great portrayal of true events of the Armenian genocide committed by the Turkish government. I don't want to give too much away but the movie is very well written with a great climax and ending. This movie with actually wake people up and will inform the audience. Overall Christian bale is an amazing headline actor. He does a great job on pulling off the role correctly. So glad this movie was made to shine light on the truth of the tragic events committed by the Turkish government. Waiting for this movie to be available for purchase! Will not leave any person in the theater not crying! Very good movie everyone should watch not just to be informed but the story is so interesting and creative!

This is the first movie depicting events of Armenian genocide. Every Armenian family has its own personal story like this. The. Story speaks to the hearts and minds of all human beings regardless of race and creed. This movie is definitely a piece of art and will stay in history of cinematography as such.",The Promise,4776998
94,Ann_Marie2145,WATCH IT! see the TRUTH! Education will free you..,10/10,5 January 2017,"I loved the preview of the movie and know this movie can teach us more about the Armenian Genocide and what Armenians had to go through... As a Jewish American I can honestly say I know what the Armenian youth are going through my ancestors barely escaped the Holocaust, but I and my family are survivors and we will survive . The uneducated people who are on here and trying to get YOU as the viewer to not watch it isn't because of the quality of the film it is the history. They are afraid THEY WILL FACE HISTORY one more time and see what animals and disgusting creatures run their government and corrupt their citizens minds. Please allow yourself to step into the shoes of innocent people who lost their lives and to understand why Armenians are fighting and have fought 101 years for recognition. DO NOT ALLOW A PAID REVIEW OR FALSE COMMENTS from the other side to stir you from the truth. They can only hide from themselves not from God or reality. Enjoy the film I know I will!
