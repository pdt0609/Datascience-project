0,tkarlmann,I have NEVER seen such a performance ... ever!,10/10,27 February 2020,"No, I'm not speaking of Brad Pitt; I'm speaking of German actor Christoph Waltz! He has won just about every award for his performance in this film, and he deserves every single one of them.
Take my Challenge: Watch this film and see if you don't get the chills whenever Christoph Waltz's character is 'interrogating' his suspects! Ooooo!
He is ULTRA polite with each one; and has supreme confidence in his scary, chilling, bold mannerisms.
All I can say is: ""You see this movie for Christoph Waltz's performance; all the rest is secondary""!

1,ruelshepperd,Glorious indeed!,9/10,12 December 2021,"Aside from the Kill Bill's I have not seen any other Tarantino film. I heard this one was good and so I watched. It's great. From the opening scene you are mesmerized by Christoph Waltz's unnerving performance. He gets a lot of credit and rightfully so. Hans Lands is possibly one of the greatest movie villains of all time. There so many iconic moments and Tarantino demonstrates how normal dialogue scenes can become suddenly intense with words alone. Every actor gives it their all with Brad Pitt giving a memorable performance as well. This movie is worth watching just for its opening but it also has back to back quality scenes that are well shot and have excellent dialogue. The movie balances it's comedy with excellent dark moments reminding viewers that this is indeed a WW2 film. Overall, my favourite Tarantino film of the three I've seen and might be for some time. Worth watching for Christoph Waltz.

2,SnoopyStyle,Quentin Tarantino's style and Christoph Waltz's menace,8/10,30 May 2014,"In 1941 Nazi-occupied France, ""The Jew Hunter"" SS Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) finds the Dreyfus family hidden by their neighbors. Shosanna Dreyfus (Mélanie Laurent) escapes after her family is massacred. Meanwhile Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) has gathered 8 Jewish American soldiers to kill Nazis behind enemy lines. Their brutal scalping campaign instills fear among the Germans. Donowitz (Eli Roth) is even given a nickname ""The Bear Jew"" for brutally beating Nazis with a baseball bat. Then in June 1944, Shosanna has a new name and a theater. She catches the eye of German war hero Fredrick Zoller who wants a big premiere in her theater that will attract the biggest of Nazi leaders. It even attracts the Jew Hunter as well as the Inglourious Basterds.Christoph Waltz is great as the cold menacing well-mannered Nazi. He is completely engrossing in every one of his scenes. Every word he speaks is dripping with menace. His scenes are quiet and some of the most compelling parts of the movie. Then Quentin Tarantino has injected his brutal violence into this Jewish revenge fantasy. It is nothing less than audacious and uniquely original.",Inglourious Basterds,361748
3,Xstal,Oh! What a Lovely War...,9/10,20 November 2022,"There's a hunter called Hans Landa you should fear, if circumcision defines the way your men appear, on the surface quite polite, underneath riven with spite, carries a scar that lets you know of his career (or at least he will). But those un-helmeted can rejoice and be spurred, avenging evil come Inglorious Basterds, being led by Aldo Raine, with a remit to cause pain, several parts may disappear as things are sheared.Great dialogue, great direction, sublime performances and original in its depiction of a war picture that's been repainted a thousand times before, but seldom with such entertainment - Tarantino's best in my opinion.

4,Leofwine_draca,Tarantino's best? I think so,10/10,5 August 2016,"No joke – I believe this film to be Tarantino's best yet. The movie has its naysayers, but I see this as the epitome of movie-making: a literate, intelligent film, beautifully shot from an excellent and original script. You might be forgiven for thinking that little more needs to be said about the Second World War, but you'd be wrong, as this outing shows: it's as fresh as a field full of daffodils in the springtime. I knew I was in for some fun with the opening sequence, in which spaghetti western style music riffs on an old classical piece and builds up the tension as Nazi officer arrives to question a remote French farmer.From then on in, we're involved in a film which uses long scenes of dialogue and character interaction as a way to build the utmost suspense. Suspense plays a big part in this film's effectiveness, and nowhere else is it better than in the basement bar sequence around halfway through: this 20-minute segment is one of my favourite scenes in a film, where great direction, scripting, and acting all combine to make a masterful moment. The cast is excellent: Brad Pitt and Eli Roth headline the titular squad of soldiers, on hand to lend some much needed humour (usually of the pitch-black variety) to the film, while Diane Kruger shows how much she's matured as an actress by playing a double agent. Michael Fassbender reminds us why he's a rising star with his turn as British officer Archie Hickox, and even a cameoing Mike Myers doesn't ruin things. Only Tarantino would cast the long-forgotten Rod Taylor as Churchill, but it's a move that pays off.In the end, though, it's the unknown European actors who really make this work. Christoph Waltz deserves his Oscar as the impeccably mannered Nazi officer, an utterly horrifying creation; Melanie Laurent delights by providing the movie's emotional core. And the little turns, from Til Schweiger's psychotically vengeful German soldier to August Diehl's slimy SS officer, are also perfectly judged. Throw in some snippets of outrageous violence to break the tension, add in a bravura climax that, for once, doesn't let the viewer down, and you have a film that's quickly become a new favourite of mine.",Inglourious Basterds,361748
5,laurabethc1,I can't believe I just now watched this for the first time.,10/10,7 February 2020,"This is a perfect Tarantino movie. It's explosive and exciting while also deep and well thought out. It took me a minute to get used to reading so many subtitles because of the variety of languages used, but I think that's a quality that makes the movie even more enticing. It is incredibly well done and it had a hold of me from beginning to end. Fair warning for any Tarantino movie, be prepared for the gore and violence. It runs rampant throughout the movie, but it's kind of gratifying seeing it happen to the Nazis.

6,ablewuzi,People seem to be missing the point,10/10,10 July 2012,"This review gives everything away, so see the movie first.It is neither allegory nor satire, the two finest categories in both fiction and cinema, and yet it approaches perfection anyway. It is of a nature I have no name for, but it is a nature that reveals truth and undermines falsehoods. Nothing is more cloaked in falsehood than the victor's depiction of past wars. It is especially true of the children of the victors--especially the children of US WWII veterans, like myself.We get our view of the war from movies like Audi Murphy in To Hell and Back or Saving Private Ryan. Nothing but praise for our heroes and cheers for killing the enemy. But QT exposes this hypocrisy by engineering a film where we are disgusted first by the excesses of the enemy and then by the excesses of our heroes. That is the first instance. The hypocrisy is slammed home in the second instance where we are first disgusted by the sight of American after American being shot dead by by a German sniper hero and secondly brought to revel in the butchery of several hundred enemy at the hands of our heroes. Tit for tat.It fits the pattern of praise for our heroes and cheers for killing the enemy, but because it is presented both ways the hypocrisy becomes self- evident. This is why so many people hate the movie--even if they fail to realize it. High art, true art, 10 of 10.",Inglourious Basterds,361748
7,paulmuehlendahl,Who the hell is Christoph Waltz?,10/10,25 August 2009,"That's what I thought, when I heard about the cast of Inglorious Basterds. And I'm both from Germany and into movies.That guy is older than 50 and so far he almost only played in mediocre TV series - and even there he didn't play the main parts. Obviously nobody ever noticed, what he's capable of. Now, thanks to QT, he got one shot to change that - and - let's put it this way - that was a bingo! He is the living proof of what a great caster Tarrantino is.By the way: I think it's a great privilege to watch the movie as a German - being able to understand everything. And the German dialog is written almost as good as the English.Now I could repeat, what many others have written here before. I'll put it short: Finally, QT is back.

8,BenjaminPopkin,My Favorite Tarantino Film,10/10,30 March 2022,"What's better than dudes killin Nazis?It is no surprise to say that this film is indeed a masterpiece of cinema. Not only in terms of writing, but the acting and execution as well. It uses every element of film in order to create tension and suspense mainly through the use of dialogue and camera work. There are multiple scenes that will have you on the edge of your seat simply because two people are having a conversation. My friend who had just seen the film for the first time calls it ""Tension: The Movie.""
When it comes to atmosphere, Tarantino is the king at creating suspense and tension in a scene. I've never seen a war film like this. It's able to balance action, comedy and drama perfectly.This film has one of my favorite opening scenes of all time. Tarantino's writing combined with Christoph Waltz genius acting and they can make any conversation seem like the most interesting thing in the world. This opening scene is both intriguing and extremely tense and grabs the attention of the viewer right away. Christoph Waltz is absolutely amazing in this film. He feels like a genuine psychopath. The character of Hans Landa is extraordinary. I also really liked the character of Shoshanna. Being a Jew myself it is awesome seeing all these Nazi's get killed by this vengeful girl. I couldn't help but feel for Shoshanna. She was definitely one of the best characters in the film with a great arc. The way she goes out is brutal. Daniel Bruhl was also great in this movie. Poor guy had PTSD and just wanted some.The characters within the Basterds are great as well. Specifically Brad Pitt and Eli Roth. The Bear Jew was awesome and the scene where we are first introduced to him really hypes him up and it doesn't disappoint. Such a well filmed scene. It really is hard not to laugh or smile when the Bear Jew starts swingin the bat. Michael Fassbender is in this film and I was surprised that he wasn't in it longer. But, his scenes were really good and he does a great job. In fact that scene in the basement bar is one of the best if not the best scene in the film. Literally every scene is so well written and interesting. There are no scenes that drag and everything that is shown or said has a purpose.Overall, Inglorious Basterds is a masterpiece, no doubt about it. It is one of the most well written films i've ever seen. All the performances are amazing, the script is fantastic, and the direction is perfect. I don't have any flaws for this film. It is one of my favorite films of all time. It is so extremely well thought out. All the characters are interesting. The opening scene is one of the best in film, and the entire third act is just perfect. In fact the whole film is honestly a perfect movie. It is also extremely rewatchable. Which is hard for a movie that is this long. But, it is so entertaining you will genuinely enjoy it with each watch.This is what moviemaking is all about. Exceeding audience expectations and keeping the viewer entertained throughout while delivering a great story. That is art. As Aldo says in the final line of the movie, ""This just might be my masterpiece."" And honestly Tarantino, I think it is. *chefs kiss*",Inglourious Basterds,361748
9,bkoganbing,World War II In an Alternate Universe,8/10,8 September 2009,"I take exception to the comment that one reviewer made saying that a film like Inglourious Basterds had not been made before. Not only was one made, but it was made during World War II. When Hitler, Dead Or Alive was shown I'm sure the same rousing cheers went up from the audience who really wanted World War II to end that way.Quentin Tarantino must have seen Hitler, Dead Or Alive and decided to do a big budget version of that B film propaganda flick from the Forties. In that one Ward Bond, Paul Fix,and Warren Hymer play three German speaking gangsters who take a contract out on Adolph Hitler from some public spirited citizen. They enlist in the army, but as soon as they can they desert grab a plane with a pilot and land in Germany and set about to perform their task. What Tarantino has given us is Hitler, Dead Or Alive with official sanction. Brad Pitt heads a group of GIs, the rest of them are Jewish so they'll have proper motivation for this job, Pitt's a good old boy from Tennessee. The purpose of their mission is to just kill Nazis, the higher up, the better. And they soon get a reputation that's come to the attention of the Fuehrer himself.This film is a throwback to those propaganda films that came out as morale boosters during World War II. Pitt and the rest of the cast look like they're having a great old time with this. Best performance is Christoph Waltz who plays an SS colonel who specialized in tracking down Jews who've escaped Hitler's final solution. He might just get an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor.As for the end, just relax and imagine this is World War II in an alternate Universe.",Inglourious Basterds,361748
10,planktonrules,"Not for everyone...but if you like this sort of thing, watch it--it is a lot of fun.",8/10,17 January 2010,"This must be said first and foremost--if you HATE violent films, then don't watch this film. The film is filled with ultra-violent images that will turn your stomach--scalpings, machine gunnings, fire bombs roasting crowds of people and the like. My assumption, and I am NOT trying to be sexist, is that in general guys will like it more than women--though I know that there are man exceptions. If you look at the demographic breakdown on IMDb of votes, this doesn't reveal any difference between men and women...unless you look carefully. You'll see that men have outvoted women 10-1! It is, simply put, a ""guy film"".Second, the film has almost nothing to do with the original ""The Inglorious Bastards: (1978)--other than the fact they were both about American soldiers fighting the Nazis. Both are very good and in a homage to the original, director Tarantino cast Bo Svenson (from the original film) in a role in the accompanying DVD extra ""Nation's Pride"". This new version is more like a Spaghetti Western than the earlier film--complete with music in many places of the film that would have worked great in a Sergio Leone movie.Third, although Tarantino did NOT mean for this to be realistic in the least, I hope that you don't believe that this is in any way based on history. Sure, there are some similarities, but so much of it is pure fantasy. There was no such military group like the ""Basterds"" and American soldiers did not do what these guys did! Heck, they made the ""Dirty Dozen"" look like pacifists!! And, unless you are a total idiot, you'll realize that the ending did not really occur!! As for the plot, I'll skip discussing that as the film came out several months ago and by now lots and lots of reviewers have already discussed this to death. Instead, I'll just say what I liked. Brad Pitt was terrific in the nominal lead. While he was NOT in the film as much as you might expect, he was hilarious and I loved his accent that was highly reminiscent of George Clooney in ""Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?"". Also, the German Colonel was amazing--speaking four different languages and making a great villain. The action was great and the film very enjoyable--but not as action-packed as you might think based on the commercials. Lots of fun and an interesting film because of all it's inside jokes, references to other films and it seeming a lot like a movie serial version of WWII. Watch this one.",Inglourious Basterds,361748
11,motta80-2,"Great fun, a real surprise",8/10,23 July 2009,"It just goes to show how wrong you can be. I had not expected to like this film. I was disappointed by both the Kill Bill films (although i preferred the second) and Death Proof (although it was better in the shorter cut of the double-bill release). I love Reservoir Dogs, admire Pulp Fiction and think that Jackie Brown is Tarantino's most mature piece of film-making - technically his most superior - including the last great performance elicited from Robert De Niro. Since then it seems to me while his films have been okay (i haven't hated them) he has been treading water in referential, reverential, self-indulgent juvenilia.Then i read the script last year for Inglourious Basterds - and i hated it! Sure it had some typical QT flourishes and the opening scene was undeniably powerful. There were a couple of great characters. But on page it was more juvenile rubbish, largely ruined by the largess of the uninteresting Basterds of the title. It made me seriously contemplate not seeing the film. The trailers did nothing to convince me. I only changed by mind when i had the opportunity to see the film with a Tarantino Q&A following in London. I figured it would be worth enduring to hear him in Q&A as i know from interviews how entertaining he can be in person.So little was i prepared for the sheer exuberant fun and brilliance of Inglourious Basterds.Easily Mr Tarantino's best work since Jackie Brown it is a triumph.Yes the references are there but they do not interfere with the story, they are not the driving force. Yes Eli Roth is stunt casting but he works fine, with little to do but look aggressive, and does nothing to hurt the film as i had feared. While i admired Mr Tarantino for using stuntwoman Zoe Bell as herself in Death Proof in order to amp-up the exhilaration of the major stunt scene her lack of any acting ability in a key role was a problem for the film. The same could be said of Tarantino's own appearances in several films, especially Robert Rodriguez's From Dusk Till Dawn, which Tarantino wrote.What really makes this work is how BIG it is. The spaghetti western vibe to much of the style, dialogue and performances is wonderfully over the top without descending too far into the cartoon quality of Kill Bill. The violence is so big. The audacity so big. Brad Pitt is so big! In the trailers the Hitler moment and Pitt's performance bothered me but in the context of the film they are hilarious. Pitt is actually brilliant here, exactly what he needs to be. He is Mifune's blustering samurai in Yojimbo, he is Robards Cheyenne from Once Upon a Time in the West, there is a very James Coburn vibe to him, and of course a suitably Lee Marvin edge.Christoph Waltz (who i did not previously known) and Melanie Laurent (who i first noticed in a brilliant French-language British short film by Sean Ellis) are sensational and i expect to see both used a lot more in the future. Tarantino has clearly not lost his eye for casting, which seemed to desert him in Death Proof. Waltz is equally large in his performance. Chilling, yet theatrical. He is Fonda from OUATITW, Van Cleef from Good, The Bad & the Ugly. And Laurent is suitably Cardinale innocence but tough, a fighter. They both dazzle here.That every member of the cast gets the fun to be had from what they are doing while not indulging themselves in just having fun and trying to get laughs helps tremendously. The laughs - and there are loads - come organically. Only Mike Myers comes close to tipping the wink and pushing it too far but his scene is reigned in just enough - with the help of a fantastic Michael Fassbender who seems pulled directly from the mold of Attenborough's Great Escape leader.All the actors shine and Tarantino throws in wonderful flourishes, but ones that work with the story. The introduction of Schweiger's Hugo Stiglitz is a riot. After a sensational slow-burn opening and a glorious intro to those inglourious Basterds the pace never lets up and over two and half hours flies by.It also looks beautiful, marking this as a return to real film-making rather than just self-indulgent silliness. The musical choices, as always, are inspired from Morricone on.The film is audacious and hilarious. After a summer when nearly every film has disappointed me it came as a huge surprise that the real fun and entertaining, but also involving and impressive film should be this one, when i would never have believed it from script form. Welcome back QT.",Inglourious Basterds,361748
12,rmax304823,Schlock and Awe.,3/10,14 August 2010,"It's one of those movies that's difficult to evaluate because it's as inconsistent as it is. The plot is ludicrous yet there are very suspenseful moments embedded in it. Nobody could have made this except Quentin Tarantino -- it's that original -- and yet it rips off bits of business and entire subplots from a dozen or more other sources.Any enthusiasm I felt for it is limited because some scenes -- the entirety of ""Chapter One"" -- approach a kind of pornography of torture that's in danger of becoming a genre unto itself, and Tarantino, the writer and director, seems to get too much of a kick out what is some pretty ugly stuff.Brad Pitt is an American officer with an atrocious mountain accent who recruits a half dozen men to be inserted into France with the object of killing Nazis. The men are Jewish. The reasoning goes: the Nazis kill Jews, therefore we will kill Nazis. The collateral killing of any innocents is beside the point. The innocent must be punished along with the guilty. See ""The Dirty Dozen"" is you want a classier presentation of this moral nihilism.Not only do Pitt and his men kill the Nazis they capture. They scalp them too, and Tarantino treats the audience several times to explicit scenes of the men slicing the scalps of hair from the skulls of the dead.One captured officer is told to indicate where his unit is and how well armed and refuses, saying he will not yield information that will endanger the lives of German soldiers. There's a scene in ""Reservoir Dogs,"" in which Michael Madsen is left alone with an innocent policeman and caresses his razor as he describes the pleasure he's going to get from torturing the prisoner. In ""Reservoir Dogs,"" Madsen is the sadistic madman and the cop is the terrified captive who winds up being mutilated. In ""Inglorious Bastards,"" the German officer who refuses to give up the information is told he will have his brains beaten out by a Jew wielding a baseball bat -- ""The Bear Jew."" The scene is long and drawn out. The camera cuts between the blackness of the cave from with The Bear Jew will emerge -- we hear the bat banging against the wall and coming close -- and close ups of the horrified face of the officer awaiting his own death. The horror is justified. The point is that the sadistic lunatic of ""Reservoir Dogs"" has become the hero now.Well -- what's the point of this scene? Just killing the recalcitrant officer is a violation of the Geneva Conventions. But why draw the scene out with such relish? What does Tarantino expect from the viewer? Chills, thrills -- exaltation -- during the anticipation of the grisly murder? LAUGHTER? That's the kind of crap I'd expect in a cheap slasher movie before the pretty girl in the underwear gets her throat cut and blood splashes all over the walls.""Pulp Fiction"" was a true original, even if it was a couple of sub-plots slapped together. ""Reservoir Dogs"" had some fine acting, though it ended pointlessly. Both were essentially well-done in their own shocking ways.But I can't forgive Tarantino for this one. I don't mind the in-jokes. (The name of Pitt's officer is ""Aldo Raine."") There is even some intentional comedy that works. Pitt is trying to pass himself off as a native Italian, and you ought to hear him mangle the word ""arrivederci."" But not even the scenes that embody suspense, the genuinely well-staged episode in the basement night club, can lift this effort out of the teen-aged trash can.Good performances for the most part, especially from Melanie Laurent who is unmistakably French, Christoph Waltz as the chief Nazi villain, and Daniel Bruhl as the fresh-faced young German hero who is given some inexplicable and uncharacteristically villainous lines just before he's done in.The climax is a fantasy, which is okay, but there are signs of outright carelessness in the direction. (I don't want to call it stupidity.) The audience of high-ranking Nazis is sitting there watching a movie about a heroic sniper and everyone -- der Fuhrer included -- is laughing out loud as hundreds of American soldiers are shot and killed in a strictly Hollywood manner, twirling around, stunt men tumbling down stairs, anachronistic squibs exploding. Does anyone actually believe that an audience of sophisticates would laugh during a movie like this? Or -- let me put it differently. We made the same kind of movie, ""To Hell And Back,"" in which Audie Murphy played his historically heroic self and slaughtered hundreds of Germans. Did anyone laugh? Tarantino unquestionably has a lot of movie-making skill. Maybe it's time for him to reconsider the parameters of his morality.",Inglourious Basterds,361748
13,bobt145,No Matter How You Spell It,10/10,25 August 2009,"...""Inglorious"" as our local theater decided to display its title on their marquee, minus the second word. It is terrific cinema.I don't hesitate to recommend this film to all but the over-squeamish. Let them never know what they're missing.I did hesitate to give it ten stars because of my experience of Tarantino's previous films. In every case, save ""Reservoir Dogs,"" they have improved with additional watching.So although I gave it ten stars, I did so reluctantly. It leaves me no ""up"" to go to.Yes Christoph Waltz is the Nazi we've all imagined the worst to be. He is cultured, sophisticated, suave and most sadistic, the kind of man who can make a glass of milk a threat and who puts out his cigarette abruptly in a strudel, grinding it into the whipped cream as if he were grinding his heel into a victim.To understand Tarantino's films, you need only have a sense of dialogue, color and pacing. The colors are as bright as necessary and when necessary, brighter yet. In the French farmhouse of the opening scene, they are muted and dark, but excessively so. Outside a brilliant sun is shining, but in the one room of the house, everything is bathed in shadows and black.It is a brilliant setting for an interrogation by Waltz, as the ""Jew Hunter"" of the SS, who dangles his host French farmer over the precipice of revealing what he cannot reveal numerous times, then pulls him back with obsequious lines of friendship and understanding.A second sadistic German, well-played by August Diehl, later functions as important actor in the final plot twist. Diehl's Nazi Major, who has an ear for German accents, is almost as good as Waltz....almost.Film classes will study much from this movie. They should look lovingly at the superb pacing. Tarantino knows just how long to draw out a scene, building suspense in the manner of Hitchcock, then at just the breaking point, suddenly coming to a resolution.For color, look for a final shot at a French Theater, where its secretly Jewish proprietor is staging a surprise for the upper reaches of Nazi leadership.We see her, played by Melanie Laurent, awaiting the hated German dignataries who will arrive for a film preview of the latest Deutsch film masterpiece, a propaganda piece about a German hero and his dubious accomplishments.Laurent is framed on a balcony, reflected in the glass mirrors of the gorgeous theater, her red lips and low cut dress reflecting everywhere the intensity of her designs on her guests. It is a single shot that would be worth an entire film.There are thankfully many more such images, many more paced scenes of exquisite dialog and suspense.In short, see it. I'm sure you'll see it again and again.",Inglourious Basterds,361748
14,zardoz-13,A revisionist Holocaust fantasy of far-fetched proportions!,1/10,23 August 2009,"""Pulp Fiction"" director Quentin Tarantino has taken Italian filmmaker Enzo G. Castellari's cult World War II thriller ""Inglorious Bastards"" (1978) and reimagined it as a cinematic atrocity entitled ""Inglourious Basterds."" Castellari's riveting mission-behind-enemy-lines thriller about a group of court-martialed Allied deserters led by Bo Svenson and Fred Williamson qualified as an electrifying actioneer with charismatic characters boasting several surprises. Tarantino's tasteless tale not only lacks charismatic characters but it also contains no surprises. A bombastic piece of wartime crap containing Brad Pitt's worst performance, ""Inglourious Basterds""--with its deliberately misspelled title--is as appalling as Sasha Baron Cohen's homophobic hokum ""Bruno."" Hopelessly pretentious with its tactless Jewish revenge plot, this polished looking pabulum takes its own sweet time unfolding during a torturous two hours and thirty-three minutes. Garrulous dialogue scenes, erratic characters and a convoluted plot that all defy good taste, much less credibility,undermine what might have been an acceptable movie. Initially, the action—which Tarantino breaks into five chapters--opens during 1941 in the scenic French countryside. Unctuous Nazi ""Jew Hunter"" Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) arrives at a farm house with several German soldiers and questions the owner, Perrier LaPadite (Denis Menochet of ""Hannibal Rising""), about Jews. Landa succeeds so well at ingratiating himself with LaPadite that the poor Frenchman breaks down and exposes the helpless Jewish family holed up down in his basement. The Nazis turn the basement into Swiss cheese with fusillades of machine gun fire. Miraculously, as only miracles in a movie can happen, one of the Jews, a young woman, Shosanna Dreyfus (Mélanie Laurent of ""Snowboarder""), manages to escape. In the next scene, U.S. Army Lieutenant Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt of ""Ocean's Thirteen"") assembles a team of Jewish Americans to infiltrate enemy lines and slaughter as many Nazis as possible. In fact, Raine demands that Sergeant Donny Donowitz (""Hostel"" director Eli Roth), Private Smithson Utivich (B.J. Novak of TV's ""The Office""), Private Omar Ulmer (Omar Doom of ""Death Proof""), Private Gerold Hirschberg (Samm Levine of ""Club Dread""), Private Andy Kagan (Paul Rust of ""Semi-Pro""), and Private Michael Zimmerman (Michael Bacall of ""Undertow"") take 100 Nazi scalps. So much for the time-honored Geneva Convention!In the next scene, Adolph Hitler (Martin Wuttke) clamors that their troops must stop talking about the ""Bear Jew."" The Fuehrer rants that the nickname German soldiers have saddled Sergeant Donowitz with is undermining Nazi morale. Indeed, Donowitz wields a baseball bat with ghoulish gusto. In one scene, he takes sadistic pleasure in smashing the skull of a Nazi soldier with a Louisville slugger. Moreover, Raine and his 'Holocaust' dogs display no qualms in scalping dead Nazis. When Tarantino isn't showing Americans carving the scalps off the fallen enemy, he has them slashing swastikas in the foreheads of live prisoners. Our psychopathic heroes have even gone so far as to rescue a renegade Nazi, Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz (Til Schweiger of ""Driven""), who has acquired a notorious reputation as a serial killer among his own ranks. Mind you, ""Inglourious Basterds"" is too comically cretinous to distinguish between good Germans and bad Nazis. Like the politically incorrect cavalry westerns of yesteryear, the only good Germans in ""Inglourious Basterds"" are a dead Germans.Three years have elapsed since Shosanna eluded Colonel Landa. She resides now in Paris and owns a cinema. A lonely Nazi soldier, Frederick Zoller (Christopher Reeve lookalike Daniel Brühl of ""The Bourne Ultimatum""), befriends her. Shosanna doesn't know Zoller is a war hero. Singlehandedly, he shot over 200 American G.I.s dead from his sniper's lair atop a bell tower. Nazi Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels (Sylvester Groth of ""Stalingrad"") has produced a movie about Zoller's exploits with Zoller playing himself. Moreover, Goebbels plans to premiere this epic in Paris for the high-ranking Nazi elite. Among those scheduled to attend are Hitler, Martin Bormann, Reich Marshal Hermann Göring, and famous German actor Emil Jannings. Of course, when Goebbels imposes on Shosanna to show the movie, she has no alternative. She does, however, have quite a barbecue cooked up for the cream of the Third Reich.Meantime, British Intelligence General Ed Fenech (Michael Meyers of the ""Austin Powers"" movies) and Prime Minister Winston Churchill (Rod Taylor of ""The Time Machine"") have concocted their own secret mission. They plan to send British Lieutenant Arch Hicox (Daniel Day-Lewis lookalike Michael Fassbender of ""300"") behind enemy lines to masquerade as a Nazi. He will accompany one of their most trusted double-agents, German film starlet Bridget von Hammersmark (Diane Kruger of the ""National Treasure"" movies), to the film premiere. Unfortunately, things go awry for Bridget and Hicox before they can rendezvous with Raine. They encounter a suspicious Gestapo officer in a basement tavern and a massacre ensues that nearly scuttles the mission.Evidently, the last thing Tarantino wanted to make was a patriotic World War II movie. Instead, he has tweaked history so that ""Inglourious Basterds"" amounts to a revisionist Holocaust fantasy of far-fetched proportions. Ridiculing the Nazis as supremely stupid swine is one thing, but it is quite another to depict Americans as murderous morons. Colonel Landa's outlandish incompetence at the premiere where he thwarts one plot but wholly overlooks another is hilariously awful. Brad Pitt's Lt. Aldo Raine, a clownish Tennessee hillbilly with an ersatz Jethro Bodine drawl, is Tarantino's homage to late B-movie hunk Aldo Ray. Actually, Ray starred in the Italian WWII thriller ""Suicide Commandos."" Pitt plays the leader of this scummy little band of scalphunters without a shred of subtlety. Indeed, ""Inglourious Basterds"" is about as subtle as a baseball bat to the brains. The only thing Tarantino forgot to do was dress his Jewish-American commandos up in grease paint, wigs, and phony accents like the Marx Brothers.",Inglourious Basterds,361748
15,abelardo64,A Comedy Of Horrors,9/10,3 October 2009,"Brad Pitt sticks his index finger in Diane Kruger's leg wound and keeps it there until he gets what he wants. Funny, horribly so. The invented yarn takes ""The Dirty Dozen"" for a ride and sometimes abandons it to pay tribute to other movies. Lots of fun. Even ""Paris when it sizzles"" is mentioned in a delightfully organic piece of dialog. I was thrilled by Christoph Waltzer's character and by his sensational performance. Brad Pitt creates a true original. I love the actor's lack of vanity. There's a quirk in the character that is pure Brad Pitt. Tarantino visits a new universe but. fortunately, his hand. his brain and his heart are visible all over the place.

16,Bolesroor,Fiasco,1/10,27 March 2010,"""Inglorious Basterds"" is a movie so clueless, so sloppy, so jam-packed full of half-ass characters and shock-value violence, so relentlessly terrible that I can't even muster the rage and indignation that most intelligent film fans feel toward Quentin Tarantino.I just pity him.American soldiers engaging in acts of deplorable violence against Nazi soldiers is not only justified- it's hilarious! And admirable. Just look at Hugo Stiglitz' statistics from the 1942-43 season in a flashback segment narrated by Samuel L. Jackson. Yes, Samuel L. Jackson. The idea that we're supposed to derive satisfaction from the torture of Nazis is just as abhorrent as a Nazi relishing the torture of a Jew. Let me tell Quentin something he should have learned in grade school: two loathsome evils do not make a right.Brad Pitt- one of my favorite actors- gives the worst performance of his career as a loudmouth macho bloodthirsty cartoon... I'll never look at him the same way again. He also looked particularly angry... for some reason I get the feeling he and Tarantino didn't quite get along. I can picture Brad slapping him silly between takes. Next time slap harder.Quentin has finally gone off the deep end and become the hack we all feared he would. He doesn't know if he's making a war movie, a parody of a war movie, an outrageous B-movie bloodbath or a documentary about milk & strudel. This is the definitive shrug by an artist who has nothing to say and insists on saying it loud.The one standout in the film is supposed to be Christoph Waltz as Col. Hans Landa, the icy, intelligent, brutally-violent Nazi commander. (There's a character we've never seen before.) His only crime seems to be the masterful use of conversation as an indirect threat of violence. The only reason for this of course is that Tarantino hasn't bothered to create any genuine tension or conflict, so we as an audience are forced to watch characters being forced to listen to Landa's menacing monologues. Dinner with a Nazi is scary enough... but by the time we get to his fifth interrogation I simply stopped caring.Who gets the award for worst stunt casting: human dingleberry BJ Novak from ""The Office"" or Mike Myers as British General Winthorp J. Starchington, III? I'd have to give the award to Myers, since his absurd makeup and wandering accent are funnier than Austin Powers on his best day.By the film's finale even the fundamentals of film-making have been abandoned and all sense of reality obliterated. We enter a small French movie theater so full of Nazi officers and SS propaganda that it might as well be Hitler's disco. Quentin has forgotten to introduce key characters earlier in the film, so now he compensates by scrawling their names in on-screen title cards, using hand-drawn arrows to identify them in the crowd shots. (Even with this pathetically sloppy device we have no idea who these people are- or why we should care.) Then Tarantino plays a David Bowie song on the soundtrack that was recorded 40 years after the film takes place! Your guess is as good as mine.A movie this awful does raise a lot of questions: Do most teenage refugees own and operate their own cinema? Are nonstop subtitles good for your eyes? Do war heroes play themselves in motion pictures? Do Nazis kidnap women and buy them dinner? Does Der Fuhrer pay full price for a matinée?Does a dying German soldier have just enough energy left to shoot our heroine? Would any high-ranking Nazi ever surrender to enemy soldiers after HE captured THEM? Should you try to masquerade as Italian when you can't speak the language?Was Hitler really gunned down in a movie theater?Of course not.Of course not.GRADE: F",Inglourious Basterds,361748
17,Theo Robertson,Hitler's Table Talk,4/10,16 February 2014,"One good thing about waiting several years after a very well received film is released is that you can step back from it and judge it on its content without all the hype . Sometimes if you go against the grain you do feel you're in danger of being branded a blasphemous heretic who should be locked up in order to keep little children safe at night or worse still to protect film makers from unpopular views . To be honest I have real excuse for missing Tarantino's INGLOURIOUS except that it never popped up in front of my radar until now . After finally getting round to seeing the movie I can put my hand on my heart and say I didn't miss all that much It's interesting that so many professional critics agreed that the best thing about the film was Christoph Waltz performance * and that this was qualified by the critics saying stuff along the lines of "" I found my interest waning when Waltz wasn't on screen "" . This sums up the entire problem with the movie - the scenes go on for far too long and lack a brevity of storytelling .A character sits down at a table and talks . And talks . And talks . There's a saying that jaw jaw is better than war war . Noble sentiments indeed and one hopes in an alternative universe that Tarantino is the British prime minister while Tony Blair is a cocky Hollywood movie brat but for a film lasting almost three hours there's little incident and actually feels longer than three hours Two selling points might have been that it's a war film and that it's a post modernist film . In other words it's a film that should make intelligent fun of all those terrible B movies featuring criminals in uniform who have the choice of a hangman's noose and volunteering for a suicide mission but there's not a lot of fun to be had here . One had hoped for constant knowing cheeky winks to the audience but this doesn't happen . There's certainly very little action to the movie and most of the film is composed of characters sitting down and talking in German or French or English . Just because a film contains subtitles doesn't make it worthy and you're left feeling there's no way this film would have been produced if it wasn't for the name of Tarantino . Little of importance happens in the narrative except to illustrate the film's own underserved self importance * Strangely enough when DJANGO UNCHAINED was released the critics once again praised Waltz as being the best thing about the movie . This is obviously critics code for "" Wait for this movie to appear on television because it's overlong , arrogantly self indulgent and often boring """,Inglourious Basterds,361748
18,ElMaruecan82,A dangerous and irresponsible film from a director who used to be great...,4/10,11 March 2011,"Reviewing ""Inglourious Basterds"" is a moral dilemma. I know it has everything to please the fans, it's entertaining, masterfully directed and edited, and features memorable characters portrayed by a big-star cast, and the whole film is carried by one of the greatest supporting and villainous performance of the last ten years. Christoph Waltz, as Hans Landa, is an unforgettable character, magnetic even in one blink or a crazy smirk. But this is a supporting performance, not enough to redeem the film.""Inglourious Basterds"" is the living proof that Tarantino lost his touch. The ""Kill Bill"" series is a masterpiece of movie homage, something that worked because you could feel that Tarantino made this film with his heart, he grew up with Asian Kung-Fu films, and made a masterpiece out of it. But now, why does he feel the need to rely all his movies on that concept? After the drive-in B-movies in ""Death Proof"" which beyond the action, was just an exercise of testosterone stimulation, and a tentative to resurrect Kurt Russel's character as he did for Travolta, I started thinking Tarantino was slipping. But I didn't take the movie that seriously and I thought even Tarantino is allowed to loosen up a bit, and please the fans of the genre, with a fun to watch and well-crafted action flick.But now, we have a film nominated in the Cannes' festival, in many glorious competitions, including the Oscars. It's something presented as a new ""Pulp Fiction"", so the movie takes itself so seriously before its release, it deserves a serious and honest critic  and all I can say is that I will probably never get the love for ""Inglourious Basterds"", a film where Tarantino caricatures himself, disguising barbarity and cruelty under the fallacious legitimacy of fighting the quintessential evil enemy, the Nazis. Done intelligently, it could have been an interesting film, but in this world where violence is preached by fanatics and fantasized by lunatics, this is (despite Waltz and his hilarious Italian scene) an irresponsible film whose plot twist made it even more dangerous, as it conveyed the dangerous message that this was the way it should have been done, therefore, this is the way WE should treat our enemies.And if violence, even in the cruelest and barbaric form is legitimated when you fight evil, you've got to question yourself about the meaning of that word. Is it right to carve a swastika in a soldier's forehead to condemn him for perpetual shame when he was just doing his duty. Were we supposed to cheer during the scalping? Or the scene where an officer's head was reduced to a pulp with a baseball bat? Were we supposed to cheer when Diane Kruger's character shot the guy she had just guaranteed his safety, or the soldier who was mercilessly shot at the end and then inevitably scalped? These scenes made me nauseous and hating the movie because it just encouraged the most odious and dangerous racist fantasies, in such a patronizing way, I wonder how come no fan felt insulted.This is a dangerous film, definitely glorifying violence by making it cool, bad-ass, and legitimate just because there's something ""naturally"" evil in the enemy, and it's not just violence, it's the graphicness, the cold-blooded horrific way of killing, and the fact that it's supposed to make people clap and enjoy the gruesomeness ... this is an irresponsible case of glorifying violence, and the script's biggest flaw. I guess the Shoshanna's subplot was a way to inject the eternal revenge story, supposedly the heart of the film. But for some reason, the actress didn't touch me, she was playing it too cool and aggressive, and the part that definitely killed the character was the glamorous sequence that looked more like an advertisement for cosmetics than anything else. Shosanna who witnessed the killing of her family, behaves like some kind of sexy James Bond girl. Probably not bad acting, but a too coldly artificial writing to be believable.(And if a great performance can't redeem a film I guess, a bad one can also ruin it... like the guy who played the projectionist, Marcel, his delivery of lines was so laughable I wonder if Tarantino was really behind the camera when it was shot)Now, I know the fans will over-analyze the film talking about its self-referential aspect, our approach to violence, a great homage to classic war films and I must concede that when I watched the opening scene, I thought it would be a masterpiece, but this 'homage' thing must stop now, it's okay for one or two scenes, but basing the whole movie structure on that has been a little bit overused by Tarantino ... it's time now to come with something more original, and less irresponsible.I say 'irresponsible' because Tarantino became like a cinematic label, as if any of his movies would automatically please the fans, I don't mean this as an insult, Tarantino was my favorite director five years ago, I've always thought the guy defined ""coolness"" in films, he was for me the-coolest-director-in-the-world and whatever he made, said and touched, was cool and entertaining. That's why I think this movie is irresponsible, because Tarantino uses his undeniable talent and creativity to communicate an extremely dangerous message, and many of his younger fans will think it's cool and bad-ass to scalp the evil enemy, because Tarantino said so, and Brad Pitt did it.To conclude, ""That's NOT a bingo!"" and the popularity of this film is revealing of a very sad reality where movies like ""Saving Private Ryan"" are considered as one of the greatest war films ever, and ""Inglourious Basterds"" praised as a masterpiece, even by Tarantino, in his pretentious closing lines  a movie I expected to like, and I ended up hating it with intensity.",Inglourious Basterds,361748
19,kosmasp,Waltz with Pitt,9/10,27 September 2009,"C. Waltz is the new discovery in this movie. He might have had a following in German speaking countries, but with this movie, he's getting world famous. Speaking 4 languages (and that's only in this movie, who knows how many more he is able to master) and being the main actor in this, despite the title of the movie. Which leads us to one thing that might be appalling to some people (especially to those who love(d) the original ""Inglorious Bastards"").The thing is that the ""Basterds"" (and yes the spelling mistake was intentional by Mr. Tarantino) do not get that much screen time. It's almost as if their story isn't the main act. You could have a problem with that (not only as a fan as stated above), so be aware that this is more an ensemble picture. And as said, Mr. Waltz is fantastic (I'm pretty sure we're gonna see more of him soon). Brad Pitt would be the second one to mention. Eli Roth on the other hand, as fun as it is to see him on the big screen, he just doesn't fit the bill. Til Schweiger and the other German and European actors are all really good. I'd say that some give the performance of their life.Speaking of the actors, one of the things that I really loved, is the fact that the movie is at least tri-lingual (is that a word?), french/German/English (with a bit of Italian thrown in there for good measure). That means a lot of subtitles if you watch the original version. But it works (imo) and makes the movie that much better.Another thing that you shouldn't expect though, is too much action. I heard quite a few people that criticized the movie, for being too talky. But that's Tarantino for you. There is action of course, but the long running time (might be a bummer for some) is made up by many conversations. There is tension, there is fun to be had, but the movie does take it's time to reach it's goal. Again, something that won't work for everybody. Great movie that cements Tarantinos status as great director.",Inglourious Basterds,361748
20,DarthBill,"""I don't suppose you'll mind if I go out speaking the King's.""",1/10,27 July 2010,"PLOT (or lack thereof): A group of Jewish American soldiers, led by Brad Pitt, go overseas to during World War 2 to terrorize and massacre Nazis while a Jewish cinema owner, the only survivor of her family, having barely escaped a German soldier known as ""The Jew Hunter"" played Christopher Waltz, who now plots to have her revenge when a film about a German sharp shooter is forced upon her to debut at her theater, while Waltz plans defection.The film is really nothing but another exercise on director Quentin Tarantino's part to see just how much useless dialogue he can cram into a scene and see how long he can drag a scene out before the audience gives up and turns the film off (similar to his misguided ""Death Proof""). Where Tarantino's earlier films, affectionate deconstructions of the noir genre, had enough chaotic energy to keep the viewer engaged while his characters blathered nonsense, much of it pop culture and cinema laced, this time around, like Death Proof, Tarantino fails to bring any of that lost energy to the proceedings. The film is dull, inert, and lifeless. Scenes drag on pointlessly with no real tension, in no small part because the characters are cardboard cut outs. Even Christopher Waltz's much ballyhooed and frankly overrated performance as the ""Jew Hunter"" Nazi fails to set off any sparks. The fact that the character is more annoying than interesting doesn't help.Brad Pitt and his ""Basterds"" aren't even in the film that much. While the marketing campaign suggested a darkly comic take on the Magnificent Seven formula, the truth is the that Pitt and the ""Basterds"" are barely plot devices.Trust me, you won't miss much by skipping this inglorious mess.",Inglourious Basterds,361748
21,Hitchcoc,"Hey, It's Tarantino!",8/10,15 July 2014,"I've read so many of the naysayers. Giving this a one rating seems really spiteful. They speak of Walz's excellence in his role. If there is an actor of such incredible skill, how can one give it one star. Yes this is violent. Yes it is gratuitous. Yes it stretches the bound of reality. But Tarantino pushes the envelope at every turn in every movie. My God, what about ""Django Unchained."" There will always be flying body parts and characters of almost supernatural proportions. The plot that leads to the face-off in the movie theater is very intricate and does stretch our believability meter, but it is really engaging. Yes, the Germans are interesting in their own ways. Remember, this is not a propaganda film. We are put into a setting that is not for one instance a real portrayal of an historical event. But it does draw out the evils of war and makes a serious statement. It does have heroes and heroines. I know at times I was left a bit confused as to the point, but it didn't diminish my enjoyment of the movie itself.

22,Llakor,Dark but Funny Comic Fantasy,9/10,30 July 2009,"Inglorious Basterds is a dark and violent comic fantasy, gloriously so. Built on the framework of The Dirty Dozen, Inglorious Basterds ditches the elongated training sequences of The Dirty Dozen to plunge into the action right away. In the process, Tarantino fixes one of The Dirty Dozen's major flaws by giving the bad guys screen time to remind us just how bad the Nazis were. The Nazis with the most screen time end up becoming the most completely human characters in the film, which ironically makes them even worse monsters.Bu ditching the training sequences, Tarantino is also able to give us a picture of the entire war, showing us not only British, American and German soldiers, but also giving us glimpses into the world of French and German civilians, both collaborators and Resistance.It goes without saying that any Tarantino film is going to have fantastic dialogue, but when Tarantino made the decision to have the French characters speak French and the Germans speak German, beyond adding a level of authenticity, Tarantino also somehow ensured that his dialogue in French was as sharp and funny and clever as his English dialogue.Case in point, during the opening sequence the Nazi ""Jew Hunter"" SS Colonel Hans Landa (Christian Waltz) is interrogating French dairy farmer Perrier LaPadite (Denis Menochet). Landa suspects that LaPadite is hiding a family of Jews. While subtly pressuring LaPadite, Landa asks for a glass of milk. After greedily gulping it down, Landa compliments LaPadite on his daughters and his cows, ""à votre famille et à vos vaches, je dis bravo."" The thing of it is, in French ""vache"" means cow, but it is also a vulgar name for the vagina. If reprimanded for this vulgar pun, Landa could quite convincingly claim not to understand French well enough to have meant it that way, but Landa does mean it that way and he means it as a threat. And LaPadite understands his meaning all too well.That is a really subtle piece of acting and word-play that many audiences would never catch, or at least they might understand the subtext without knowing the exact nature of the threat. The film is rich with that kind of detail. All of the French and English dialogue is chosen with that same attention to detail and while I can't swear to the German, I would suspect that it shows a similar level of craft.Inglorious Basterds opens with the phrase, ""Once Upon a Time... in Nazi-Occupied France."" Personally, this reminds me of the opening of every Asterix book and movie, another comic fantasy in a war-torn occupied France. Like Asterix, Inglorious Basterds is howlingly funny in places, although the film also turns darkly serious.In its more serious moments, Inglorious Basterds reminds us that the first casualties of war are compassion and the ability to relax, as in almost every elongated sequence of the film, Tarantino finds a new way to build cruel tension to almost unbearable levels.Tarantino also reminds us that film is dangerous, even inflammable and that its power deserves respect.If you can see this film as I did in a packed theatre filled with knowledgeable fans who get every joke, that you will see this masterful film the way that it was meant to be seen. If you are not that lucky, all that you will see is a great, great film that delivers a darkly funny punch.",Inglourious Basterds,361748
23,HalGuentert,This Movie Was A Bad Joke About WWII,1/10,21 January 2010,"For those that have studied WWII, and unfortunately, seen real human brains on the ground, this movie is a travesty, a sadistic farce, and a complete waste of time like most of Tarantino's other questionable work. I do admit to liking ""Reservoir Dogs"" to a point. However, this thing does not even have an original title.I (unfortunately) received this DVD by mistake and see this project as a new low for Brad Pitt and the other actors taking part in this joke of making jews more barbaric than the Nazis. It perpetuates blame on the common German soldiers while covering up the major part US and UK bankers like Prescott Bush had in funding Hitler, as well as, the now confirmed part that British Intelligence had in bringing Hitler and Mussolini to power beginning immediately at the end of WWI.WWII was a complex and tragic event, and the real world history deserves better than this self serving, mythological blood feast served up for fools too lazy to look for the truth and try to prevent a recurrence. History can repeat itself when we become manipulated by propaganda, desensitized to inhumane actions, and self righteous.If you want to look at atrocities, many can argue that Stalin made Hitler and the Nazis look like rank amateurs in the business of murdering innocent people, as well as, the drug crazed gangs of Niger roping off streets with human intestines. Where does it end? We need to be getting the multitude of shadowy intelligence agencies under control and accountability instead of getting a cheap emotional thrill about perpetuating their myths in Hollywood and our capitol cities.",Inglourious Basterds,361748
24,secondtake,Larger than life in the best cinematic ways,10/10,8 September 2009,"Inglourious Basterds (2009)We all know by now that Quentin Tarantino is in love with the movies, so it's no surprise that much of this film centers are around an astonishing movie theater. But his love of movies also shows in the way he works with classic ideas and great visual strategies that come from decades of the best of Hollywood. The very first scene is like a remake from some classic Western--John Ford or Sergio Leone, take your pick--with the isolated family seeing trouble coming in, ever so gradually, from the far distance.And then trouble arrives, and it unfolds here like a croissant in the morning sun, steam slowly rising into the French Provincial air. This, you'll see, or you know already, is film-making at its best, old-school or new-school, it doesn't matter. The suspense, the elegant and fluid camera-work, the astonishing writing and even more astonishing delivery by the two men at this very first juncture, playing a kind of ""I know what you are thinking"" kind of game, all drawn out in a breathtaking, poetic, nerve-wracking way.Then all hell breaks loose. This is the other side of Tarantino, the violent violence, where the blood is too red and too balletic to be real. I don't have the ability to step out of this kind of on screen gore and so it shocks me every time, and it seems like the movie might work just as well (or better) with implied violence, rather than splattering it in your face. But this director, I think, sees all of it from a director's point of view--that everything is artifice, including the preceding scene with the two men, where I, for one, was impressed partly by believing it, by being completely sucked in. Which makes the offputting violence that follows all the more upending.I have no doubt it is this push-pull effect that makes all of Tarantino's films have that energy few others can match. In this case, there is a lot of plain old fun built into seeing the bad guys get what they deserve (I felt a weird pleasure, which I confess and which I don't understand, in seeing one very particular bad guy shot to pieces near the end), and a lot of suspense as you root for the unlikely heroes. The archetypes, like Brad Pitt's good bad guy role with a Kentucky accent (better than your Italian, Brad), and the more original characters, like the young woman who owns the theater and is truly trapped by circumstances, equally make their scenes larger than life. In fact, Inglourious Basterds is pure Hollywood in the way it makes everything on the screen larger than life. Isn't that what the golden age of Hollywood was all about? Yes. And it is exactly what some directors like Tarantino are still bent on pulling off. A great film. Whatever the problems and the gore, this strikes me as a perfect film the way Fargo is perfect, or Reservoir Dogs. Tastes aside, you have to see it.",Inglourious Basterds,361748
25,claudiaeilcinema,Tarantino and His Italian Critics,6/10,4 October 2009,"You should hear the Italian critics talking about Tarantino and ""Inglorious Bastards"". They run out of superlatives. One of them last night actually shouted ""Tarantino is my God"". Wow! I, personally, suspect that Tarantino is the result of a generation of TV and bad (now cult) exploitation movies. I enjoy him, don't get me wrong, but I'm not shouting miracle when I still have ""The Great Escape"", for instance, so fresh in my mind. ""Inglorious Basterds"" more than any of the other Tarantino films is all about appearances. There is nothing underneath other than references to other movies. Nothing wrong with that in fact I like it but I refuse to treat Quentin Tarantino as a sort of Deity. I can't buy it. I think he should be placed exactly where he belongs among the best of his kind but what kind is that? Never mind, it works. Italian critics who are so prepared to destroy their own - you should read some of the reviews for ""Baaria"" - are prepared to fall to their knees in front of Tarantino. This are the same critics that last year, the year of ""Milk"", ""Slumdog Millionaire"" ""Edge Of Heaven"", The Wrestler"" etc, gave the David de Donatello Award for best picture to ""Grand Torino"" I want to make sure that I'm making my point clearly. ""Inglorious Bastards"" is a terrific comedy with most of Tarantino's trademark tricks in place. You'll have a great time with Brad Pitt and an incredible Christoph Waltz as the ultimate Nazi villain but don't expect a masterpiece as declared by some critics. That kind of review damages the film and me the spectator. It forces something on me. As if I was suppose to feel the same otherwise there is something wrong with me. No. I liked it, I recommend it for what it is. Period.",Inglourious Basterds,361748
26,CineCritic2517,A failure to fuse different movie genres into one feature.,1/10,11 September 2009,"Tarantino was in my opinion a master in fusing different movie genres into one. But he miserably and painfully fails to do so in Inglourious Bastards (IB). Where in the past in movies like Pulp Fiction and the Kill Bill saga there is a constant mix of both comical and gritty scenes which are consistently applied throughout these movies, in IB Tarantino tried to only loosely paste them together. The result is an unfocused string of scenes in which each displays another facet of the different genre. In one scene it's drama and violence followed by one that would have perfectly fitted into a Naked Gun type of film. This simply doesn't work and I found myself being highly irritated watching this failed experiment ruin an otherwise fine movie idea.Another failure of the movie is to not present the viewer dialogs which are actually worth the elaborate time it takes to conclude them. The dialog often proceeds at glacial speeds and likewise just as easily melds and vaporises as time progresses, leaving a pile of scattered moraine in stead of something actually contributing to the, as it already stands, paper thin plot. In the end IB is nothing more than a mismatch of ideas with a steal from Pulp Fiction here and a pinch from Reservoir Dogs there. These rehashed ideas, far superiorly employed in the past, will perhaps fool the younger moviegoer into believing they are watching something fresh and innovative, but people who have seen these other movies by QT surely wont be impressed. The movie ends at two and a half hours featuring long, drawn-out scenes that could have been easily compressed into one and a half. And like with Death Proof, there is far too little pay off to warrant stealing people's time and attention over these all-heard-before and talky routines.Through most of the duration of the film I contemplated suggesting to my friend, who was clearly not being entertained either, to leave, but I decided to see it through till the end. Suffice to say I have never been so glad the ending credits finally rolled so I could get up and make my way to the exit.The pro's:Excellent acting (apart from a horrible Pitt who was clearly miscast) and good cinematography in a film with some solid and interesting ideas.The con's:The film's criminally in need of an editor and serves perhaps a bit too much dialog in a foreign language for the average moviegoer to swallow. Not enough suspense to justify bludgeoning the audience with endless routines of mere dialog and no character development to make the audience care about whatever outcome these scenes, and ultimately the whole movie, might bring.3.5/10",Inglourious Basterds,361748
27,uhmartinez-phd,A Rip Roaring Yarn,8/10,7 October 2009,"An fun, engrossing, beautifully crafted piece of nonsense, the likes of which we hadn't seen in a long long time. The silliness of the story is marvelously camouflaged with great dialogue and some superb performances. Christoph Waltz must be thinking already about his acceptance speech. What a performance! The civilized monster, polyglot, refined and deadly. He gets us going from the first, sensational scene. Brad Pitt is also wonderful. Was he putting a Mussolinni chin while impersonating (hilariously) an Italian? I thought so. His character's name sounds like Aldo Ray and I'm sure that's no accident. The film is full of movie references. Another character is named Fenek, as an homage to his 1970's sexpot, Edwige Fenech. What is already one of Tarantino's trademarks is his sure step along the most immediately recognizable bits of pop culture. He's clearly not a cultured man but a pop expert, king in a world where people get their news from TV, don't read, other than magazines and comics, etc. That's how it happens, to be in the right place at the right time. For better or worse this are Tarantino times.

28,Sandcooler,Brilliantly offbeat wartime western,10/10,20 September 2009,"Wow. It's been a while since I left a movie theatre so overwhelmed. From the first minute to the last this movie is shocking, amusing and horrendously entertaining all at the same time. The prologue is vintage Tarantino. The way the tension is build up throughout that opening scene is truly magnificent, and the camera pans down just at the right time. And by that time you've already learned to absolutely despise Landa, probably the most disgusting character Tarantino ever came up with. He's truly a man you love to hate, and his charming persona just makes him seem even more evil. He's if possible even more threatening than Jules Winfield was in the infamous breakfast scene from ""Pulp Fiction"". The segments with the basterds are probably the ones Tarantino had the most fun with, and these segments really know no boundaries in any way. Not only are they hilariously violent (the baseball bat!), they also ignore every possible historic fact. I wouldn't really want it any other way really. Another highlight is the bar scene, which illustrates perfectly how unpredictable this movie is. There are too many good moments to be naming them all, but this movie benefits so much from its outrageousness you really need to see everything for yourself.",Inglourious Basterds,361748
29,oneguyrambling,Sorry sweaty-palmed fanboys - this is one of Tarantino's worst.,6/10,8 November 2010,"Read on before you complain! I am a fan of Tarantino, so why give Basterds a middling rating, a score similar to such non-classics as Big Man Japan and Silent Hill?Well after the initial scene there just aren't any scenes that ""pop"" or are worthy of a zippy description.IB just isn't as intricate and tricky as I think it wants to be, so we are left with a movie with long drawn out scenes, not enough dialogue worthy of note and insufficient action to fill in the lengthy gaps. I think Tarantino felt this might become known as ""the one where some Jewish guys have a crack at Hitler"".As mentioned the best scene in IB is the first with all the hallmarks of a Tarantino special. In essence it is a German soldier politely but forcefully interrogating a Frenchman who he believes to be harbouring Jews, so I'll leave the description at that, because Tarantino makes it so much more that trying to describe it in more detail would be pointless.In broad terms though it has crackling dialogue, the tension builds throughout and the scene is allowed to play out over about 20 minutes, where other directors might give it 3, get to the payoff and move on.In Chapter Two we meet the Basterds – in another example of ""taking their word for it"", as we are informed that the Basterds are an elite team of vicious, mostly Jewish, soldiers hellbent on killing as many Nazis as possible and striking fear into enemy ranks.We are introduced to a couple of Basterds, a German named Hugo Stiglitz who is infamous and feared (again because we are told so) and the ""Bear Jew"", a man who carries a baseball bat and beats his victims to a bloody pulp, but mostly they remain a faceless bunch headed by one Bradley Pitt - you might have heard of him.Speaking of baseball bats, in the real life game of ""Rock, Paper, Scissors"" I'd take a machine gun over a baseball bat every time. What does the Bear Jew do in combat, hang in the background until someone runs out of bullets? Or wait until a German soldier shows up with a club or bat so it is a fair fight? Seems a pretty inadequate weapon 99% of the time.We are given a couple of examples as to how the Basterds work, and EVERYONE has seen the speech Aldo Raine (Pitt) gives to his squad applicants, ""And I want my scalps!"" but they just don't seem that scary or menacing really. Nonetheless (because the plot says so) their reputation gets all the way to Mr Hitler himself, who deems them trouble enough that he takes time out of running a conflict involving several million soldiers to consider how he might deal with them.The remaining Chapters involve events that bring the main combatants into close proximity so that we might have some sort of climax to the film. In this case a Nazi propaganda film is to be premiered in a small French cinema, with many German dignitaries in attendance, including a man with an abbreviated mustache.This gives a small window of opportunity for assassins to kill most of the Nazi war machine in one crack, thereby ending the war (apparently). At least in this circumstance Tarantino didn't think small! Of course it leaks out that the premiere is happening and the British intelligence formulate a plan to bring in the Basterds and have them meet with a liaison to crash the premiere and do what they do best.Need I mention at this point we are about an hour and 40 minutes into the film, and the titular Inglourious Basterds have two on screen kills? Seems a little light in a war movie when they are the most feared soldiers in the entire war doesn't it? This movie isn't overlong, just ""over-nothing-worthwhile-happening"". I can sit through 2 and a half hours standing on my head if the movie justifies it, but I can't say that Inglourious Basterds gave me sufficient reward for my time, let alone ""Bang"" for my buck. There were almost more rounds fired in the standoff at the conclusion of Reservoir Dogs! Nazi Colonel Hans Landa, as the ""Jew Hunter"", is the best thing in the film and it is no surprise that he gets the best dialogue. The scenes in which he features provide some tension and menace that is not really tangible for the remainder of the film.As mentioned before the Basterds are largely under-utilised but that is also reflective in the fact that they are soldiers and this is a movie largely without battles and action.Tarantino sticks to his guns though and IB is again a movie made solely on his terms, the long drawn out scenes (many of them boring), considerable use of subtitles - even a bizarre section with a voice-over by Samuel L. Jackson for some reason - the music at times is also way too contemporary for a WW2 film, and if I bagged 300 for that then I must definitely point it out here.I think it's interesting that Tarantino chose to plot his film in an alternate version of WW2, because in an alternate universe Inglourious Basterds would have far more action and be a far superior film.Final Rating – 6.5 / 10. As a director Tarantino aims for ""cool"" above all else. This just ain't that cool, regardless of what the sweaty palmed fanboys think.P.S. When I looked to IMDb to make sure I spelt a couple names right I saw that IB is currently in the top 100 ranked films of all time. This is surely just a sad joke.If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com",Inglourious Basterds,361748
30,basilisksamuk,Frustrating Experience,5/10,4 August 2010,"Utterly frustrating viewing experience. There is an excellent film in here but it's ruined by the way in which Tarantino breaks the contract with the viewer. There is absolutely no need to vandalise the viewing experience by insulting the intelligence of the viewer and by scribbling (literally) over the images on screen in a way that further implies the viewer is an idiot who could not follow a simple story without the guidance from an unseen hand.The obvious thing to do to improve this film by 100% is to get rid of the Inglorious Basterds. They are completely irrelevant to the action and the storyline. You need an American covert presence in Europe to carry the story but the basterds team in no way fulfils this requirement, rather it detracts. For one thing the whole scalping and torturing your enemy storyline makes the basterds no better than the Nazis; for another the Brad Pitt character is an embarrassment from start to finish. I do not blame Pitt for this as he is clearly playing the part as the cartoon character that was defined by the script.I'm not averse to doing things differently and I think the unexplained change to the real historical timeline and the use of contemporary music works well. The first ""chapter"" is a master class in creating tension as is the sequence in the cellar. As others have commented the acting of Christoph Waltz is astonishing and quite the best thing in the film. But there are other beautiful sequences such as the opening of chapter five with its superb framing and use of the colour red. Such a pity that the rest of the film is so poorly done.Whilst I know that few will agree with me, the director Tarantino most reminds me of is Stanley Kubrick. Like Kubrick he can produce scenes of breath-taking originality but he is unable to sustain the vision over an entire film. If Tarantino could shed his sometimes infantile interjections into his own film-making process he could produce a work of true genius. Inglorious basterds is half genius, half embarrassing nonsense.",Inglourious Basterds,361748
31,TOMASBBloodhound,What's worse than having to listen to 2 1/2 hours of Tarantino dialog?,5/10,20 August 2011,"The answer: Having to READ about 2 hours of it! Yes, the man is talented. And yes, there are parts of this overly-lengthy film that are terrific, but I've just come to the point where the thrill is gone. Gone is my appetite for Tarantino's style with excessive homages to an era of films I never saw, and neither did many of his hard-core fans. Gone (if it ever was truly there) is my desire for endless conversations that seldom lead anywhere or advance what little plot his films often have. It's all pretty much gone. Tarantino has been doing this to us for almost twenty years now, and its time that either himself or myself moves on.Inglourious Basterds is marketed to the masses as somewhat of a revenge film about Jewish commandos slaughtering Nazi troops behind enemy lines with Brad Pitt as their leader. Some of this lengthy film will in fact actually deal with that story line. But so much more of it is window dressing with long, subtitled conversations in either French or German. Many of our characters are not believable... even in a Tarantino universe. Nothing we see is plausible. And very little of it is tense. Many have pointed to Christoph Waltz's portrayal of a kind of SS detective as being the lone good aspect of this film. That's pretty much the case. This guy grabs the film and runs away with it. Pitt is tolerable for once, but his character doesn't have to do much in terms of acting range. Thank Goodness. Diane Kruger has some nice moments, and its good to see her in something other than National Treasure movies. I guess... watch if you must, but this is not the director's best work. His breed of film peaked with the Kill Bill movies, and it isn't clear if he is capable of doing anything that isn't just a patchwork of what others have done. Inglourious Basterds is a long, talky waste of 153 minutes. Its few good scenes aren't enough to justify the rest. 5 of 10 stars.The Hound.",Inglourious Basterds,361748
32,t_atzmueller,Christoph Waltz - an Oscar performance within a pile!,4/10,20 October 2010,"It's a useless thing to post a review on a movie that already has more than a thousand reviews on IMDb. But the division between people who loved it and those who hated it is rather fascinating so I'll add my two cents.I'm a person who's of the later opinion. I just don't like Tarantino and his way of making an ""homage"" to me just seems like a cheap way of stealing stuff, that's not known or obscure at best for a mainstream audience but insults the true fan.I'm also a fan of 'alternate realities'-story lines (I recommend Ian McKellen in ""Richard III"", taking the age-old Shakespeare play into the time of WW2) and not necessarily too concerned with historic accuracy. In my mind, one could have done something with the story of ""Inglorious Basterds"" but what ruins it in this film is the horrible acting.Not even talking about Brad Pitt hamming it up like it really was a real grind house film but what in the heavens could have provoked any director to put Eli Roth in front of a camera? I realise that there isn't much real acting involved in a homage to exploitation flicks but at least a little charisma, a little character for an protagonist in a mainstream movie – is that too much to ask for? We now move on to the German imports: Till Schweiger, Daniel Brühl and Gedeon Burkhard. Schweiger divides the audience in Germany. He's by fans depicted as the Ben Affleck of German cinemas; by adversaries he's considered as a German version of Ben Affleck who's performance is annoying but who can produce a sellable love comedy during Summer. Brühl is another actor who leaves critics divided. 'A great talent in the making', say some; 'an actor with a steady repertoire of four facial expressions', say the others (three of which are featured in ""Inglorious Basterds"". And of course Burkhard, prior to ""Inglorious Basterds"" a regular in many-a daily soap-opera that are geared toward pensioners and the unemployed. The rest of the cast is relatively unknown to me and I'm relative grateful for that. And, adding insult to injury for hammy acting and lazy direction: the caricature of Hitler and his regime, just a few years after an audience has applauded the performances of Bruno Ganz and others in ""Der Untergang"".I give this film four stars  no, I give the actor Christoph Waltz four stars. And another Oscar  because he deserves it. Skills and a presence that rivals performances of contemporary roles like Heath Ledger as the Joker or Javier Badem in movies like ""No Country for Old Men"" and ""The Sea Inside"". That's the fascinating aspect about the movie: putting up 1st class actors against 2nd and 3rd rate: the result is ""Inglorious Basterds"".",Inglourious Basterds,361748
33,Pumpkin_Man,Very Boring!!!,5/10,25 August 2009,"I tried hard to like this, but in the end, this movie was just as bad and boring as Tarantino's crap-fest, Death Proof! There were a few funny parts and a couple of action scenes, but the rest was just dull conversations in another language. You practically read the whole movie. There was 95% talking, and 5% action! The film is told in 5 chapters, and the only two chapters I kinda liked were Chapter Two & Five. Brad Pitt plays Lieutenant Aldo Raine who is the leader of a group called The Basterds. They kill Nazis, and plan to kill all the Nazis and Adolf Hitler at a theatre during a Nazi fest. A few weeks ago, I rented the original Inglorious Bastards movie to get ready for this one, but that was a waste of time, because this has nothing to do with the 1970's version. I definitely would not recommend INGLORIOUS BASTERDS!!!",Inglourious Basterds,361748
34,terrygiu2000,The Jewish Scalphunters of Quentin Tarantino,7/10,5 October 2009,"Once again, revenge is at the center of a Quentin Tarantino movie. This time a Jewish dirty dozen takes things on their own hands. Tarantino re-writes history and shortens WWII with a comic stroke that is as entertaining as it is vacuous. A fantasy that re-arranges some controversial historical points. Okay, it's a movie and as such it works for most of its two and a half hours. Christoph Waltz opens things up in the most promising way. The opening sequence is filled with a subtle but unbearable tension. Weltz amalgamates all the Nazi villains we have loved and hated in the movies into one glorious creation. (I will advise my countrymen to see it in its original multi-language version - the Italian version is another movie altogether. Some of the extra pleasures are in the dialog that, naturally, are not to be found in the Italian version) Brad Pitt, rapidly becoming one of the best character actors in the world, with a leading man's face and billing, is truly fantastic. Diane Kruger makes a credible Barbara Bouchet (one of Tarantino's muses from trash action Italian movies from the 70's) and the rest of the cast has some exquisite touches like Rod Taylor as Winston Churchill. Highly recommended for a Sunday afternoon.",Inglourious Basterds,361748

36,funkyfry,Exceptionally poor effort at pornographic sadism,2/10,28 June 2010,"I really don't like this movie. I think right now I'm rating it like a 2 or 3. I haven't seen ""Death Proof"" but I think I've seen all the other ones he's directed and this is definitely the worst. In fact his films have been getting worse all the time and the last respectable thing he did was ""Jackie Brown"" as far as I'm concerned. I'm pretty much through with him. His credit is totally gone with me. As far as I can tell he makes movies to feed the fantasies of 14 year old boys. It seems like his early movies were fun and different, even if they used a lot of stuff from older movies they put it together in a different way. But this movie and ""Kill Bill"", these are just stupid movies to me. Pornography of violence basically.There's something to be said for the old exploitation movies. I'm not entirely ignorant on this subject. He used a lot of ideas from the B-crime movies of the 50s with ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Reservoir Dogs"", and then he did I guess his version of ""blaxpoloitation"" with ""Jackie Brown."" But the thing is, that movie was made with respect to black people. It's not even really a blaxploitation movie at all, just a decent modern caper movie that uses music from the 70s movies. But with this ""Inglorious Basterds"" thing, it's really like he's trying to make his own ""Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS"" movie. But he's trying to have his cake by making it ""Ilsa, She Wolf of the Jewish resistance."" And ultimately he just presents this sad tableau where every character and every scene is dehumanized and dehumanizing. If he had actually wanted to make a movie that would have entertained Hitler, he couldn't have done better.I want to give this movie points for being different, but how can you reward somebody just for being worse than others, for daring to go further into violence for the sake of violence and justifying it with some lame-arse stuff like ""oh they're all Nazis, who cares what happens to Nazis?"" It's still dehumanizing in my opinion, it debases us to be encouraged to fantasize about committing this kind of violence to anyone. Movies like this are what makes me scared for the future of America, which I love dearly. Don't try to say that the ""Basterds"" are presented in some kind of negative light, or the film is a parody of American Exceptionalism. That's just an excuse that Tarantino built into the film with a few throw-away lines like ""watching the Jew Bear bash a Nazi is the closest thing we get to a movie."" Just to be self conscious about using violence and hate as a cinematic value (like the most base and disgusting exploitation films Tarantino apparently adores in a different way than I ever could) is not to justify it, not even in an aesthetic sense.",Inglourious Basterds,361748
37,atarilord,The only WWII film I enjoyed,9/10,24 August 2021,"This is actually the only World War II film I found myself glued to the screen because of how fun and enjoyable this is.

All I can say is that this film is just fun.

39,adrongardner,This one ain't DeathProof,1/10,21 August 2009,"Previous Tarantino movies were from a guy in love with other movies. This one is from a guy in love with his own writing. It isn't Inglorious, its disgusting.I saw Pulp Fiction at 14 years old, and I saw it 6 times in the theater. I have an original Reservoir Dogs poster and I think Jackie Brown is a timeless achievement and Quentin Tarantino's best movie. Kill Bill was a huge mess, but it was entertaining.I absolutely hated Inglorious Basterds. The entire point of a film is to entertain and if there is one unforgivable sin a movie can commit, it is boredom. The movie is just a collection of endless and excruciatingly boring scenes of people talking at tables in various languages. There is even one scene where 3 people talk for nearly 45 minutes at the same table, before, thankfully they are all shot. I wished they would have been killed off after 5 minutes. Even Woody Allen knows when to shut the F**K up. This table talk style is a Tarantino hallmark, but in other films, I actually cared about what they were saying and the people who were talking. Here, I couldn't care less. All of Quentin's films display an enormous confidence, particularly Jackie Brown. But here there is a pervasive feeling in every scene, Tarantino had no idea where he was going with the film. Is it violent? Sure there's torture and scalping galore, but you'd have to remind me. Thankfully, the film was so thin, I didn't even remember I had seen it earlier in the day when until I saw a review headline on MSNBC. He's out of gimmicks and apparently dying to write a novel.

41,Captain_Couth,A mediocre effort from Tarantino. Nothing but a pastiche of films and silly sitcom dialog,5/10,21 August 2009,"I saw Inglourious Basterds at a midnight screening and I was unimpressed with the movie. Seems like Tarantino has run out of ideas and sharp dialog. He promised a war movie in the style of an Italian western. All I saw was a pastiche of Italian westerns, bad humor and long drawn out dialog that lacked any of his previous films unique wit. Being a fan of pop culture Tarantino peppers the script with a lot of it from the 30's and 40's (yes it seems really forced). If you have seen a lot of Italian westerns, then you'll know what you're in for. Long panning camera shots, close ups of eyes and even longer wide shots. The actions scenes are few and scattered throughout the film. What I really didn't like about the film itself was that it's too helter skelter. One minute it's serious and the second it's silly with a lot of inane dialog and boring chatter that took over ten years to write (according to QT)..The characters were not that interesting. Shoshana (played by Melanie Laurent) is the main character and the film centers around her involvement in the underground. She come off cold and not all that interesting. Colonel Landa (Christoph Waltz) is the ""Jew Hunter"" but he comes off like a Teutonic Columbo (I kid you not) and really mugs and overacts for the camera. The Basterds (led by Brad Pitt as Aldo Raine) are marketed as being the central characters of the film. But their appearances are too few and far between. Pitt's character's accent and personality comes off cartoonish and it really doesn't work. Eli Roth is not a very good actor and his character ""The Bear Jew""is very wooden. He's a good filmmaker who should stay behind the camera. Mike Myers guest role as a British officer is pretty bad and the audience was laughing along every time he spoke.I wish the movie was made as a farce but I don't think that was Tarantino's intentions. He tried to make a ""spaghetti western war movie"". But it comes off like a real pedestrian effort that's caters to an audience that's not his. This film felt like his first ever mainstream movie. I was really stunned by how bad this movie is. The lighting is real annoying. I know Robert Richardson loves the whole ""halo light"" thing but it can be very distracting. The QT fan boys will fall all over themselves for this one because when he says jump they always say ""how high?"" I don't know how well this movie will do at he box office but what I do know is that he needs a hit big time to re coop the money lost for Grindhouse (which I really enjoyed). Tarantino used to fire on all cylinders, even in his so-so movies (Kill Bill Vol.2) but this one has my scratching my head going ""what the hell did I just watch?""Several of Tarantino's trademarks appear in this film such as ""The Mexican Stand-Off"", pop culture references (albeit 30's and 40's), a bare foot scene (QT has a well known foot fetish) and the n-bomb is dropped a few times in the film (don't ask how they managed to work that into the movie).",Inglourious Basterds,361748

""The Guns Of Navarone"", ""Operation Crossbow"" and a myriad of 70's B exploitation Italian movies. Tarantino is certainly clever and knows how to use the camera but then, I have to say it, nothing. The childish ""divertimento"" dressed in smart ass dialog remains there. The entertainment value is, perhaps, the most one should expect from a movie but it seems a damn shame that such a talent should be put at the service of something so one dimensional. I can't help but remember Ernst Lubitch's ""To Be Or Not To Be"" that was also a comedy with remarkable, inventive dialog but it also had so many other layers that ""To Be Or Not To Be"" after 70 years still resonates with whoever has seen it. Christoph Waltz is terrific and Brad Pitt is always great fun to watch but the experience is purely epidermic in spite of some truly gruesome moments. Am I expecting oranges from an apple tree? If that's so forget what I've just said and run to meet Tarantino's basterds.

43,okieindian,Inglourious Basterds waste of time film and my money,1/10,20 December 2009,"Too many morons will believe this is a factual film and those idiots will pass it on as such. It is an insult to the veterans of WWII, and an insult to the intelligence of film goers. The trailer for the film is a piece of misleading garbage that has little to do with the film, and the group portrayed in the trailer should have been called ""The Inglourious Idiots"". Added to all the above is the fact that too many Hollywood drug addicts think that having most of the film in a foreign language makes it a better film. That just proves that much of the Hollywood crowd is a bunch of snobbish, self-important, elitist, and truly uncreative a**es that do not know how to make a good film. I have never been more disappointed in a film. The high point of the movie is Brad Pitt (Angelina Jolie's live-in). His pitiful imitation of the Billy Bob Thornton (One of Angelina's many former squeezes)character in ""Slingblade"" was hilarious. The attempt to copy Billy Bob is soooooo bad that Pitt should be at the top of the list for that ""Rotten Tomato"" award.. Sheesh, when will film makers try to actually make a good film again. Of the last 100 I've watched, there have been two I'd like to see again. This one is 101 on the list...",Inglourious Basterds,361748
44,ferguson-6,Business is a-Boomin',8/10,25 August 2009,"Greetings again from the darkness. Quentin Tarantino and the Coen Brothers are whom I depend to always deliver something never previously seen on screen. Creativity of itself is not sufficient ... but when combined with a love and mastery of film-making, more often than not we are treated to something special. QT certainly delivers that with the Basterds.I found Chapter One (of Five) to be a mini-spaghetti western film short replete with perfect music, anticipation, stare downs, word play, a shoot-out and ultimate escape. Christoph Waltz immediately seizes his role as Col Landa and never lets go. He envisions himself, not as the ""Jew Hunter"" (a moniker he relishes, nonetheless) but rather as a super sleuth in line with Sherlock Holmes (hence the pipe!).Chapter Two introduces us to the titular Basterds led by Lt Aldo Raine with Brad Pitt as the hillbilly ring leader of the Dirty Dozen-type band of Nah-Zee killers. Pitt's exaggerated jaw and outlandish accent, coupled with his QT-penned dialogue, makes for one frightening cartoon character on a singular mission. And at the same time, it is a real hoot! The multiple story lines begin to intermingle in a fabulously intricate tavern scene. The dialgoue and approach to this remind a bit of Reservoir Dogs, but with the subtle facial gestures and multi-lingual word play, it goes to a whole different level. While many thought this scene dragged, I was fascinated.The finale in the Cinema Paradiso (not really, but it was the first thing I thought of) is well paced and delivers a fabulous ending of dramatic violent intimacy in the projector room and flamboyant special effects in the main theatre. Let's just say Lincoln's last night at the theatre ended better than Hitler's and Goebbel's.So many movie references in the 2 and a half hours that you can't help but tip your cap to Mr. Tarantino. For us movie lovers, he really is our leader. He is living out our fantasy and delivering just often enough to keep us fed. As an example, the lead up to the Cinderella scene is just pure torture as QT works in his foot fetish. Having previously mentioned the work of Pitt and the fantastic turn by Christoph Waltz, I must also say that Melanie Laurent in her red dress, helped capture the feel of 40's and 50's femme fatales. She was absolutely perfect.While this one is not quite at the level of Pulp Fiction, it is purely a cinematic marvel. Though not the most accurate of history lessons, there is still a bit of message that sneaks in. But more importantly, the message of cinematic adoration can't be missed. Bravo Mr. Tarantino. And thank you again.",Inglourious Basterds,361748
45,jeffchan,More junk from Tarantino,1/10,21 February 2010,"Tarantino continues to make idiotic cartoons that at best glorify and at worst encourage violence. Next time there's a mass shooting somewhere, consider whether movies like this one have made violence fashionable, dramatic, cool, newsworthy, glorious or even a little less than totally unacceptable.Suspension of disbelief can't possibly include fantasizing that the Nazis would be stupid enough to send all four of its top leaders into a tiny Jewish-run cinema in Paris. Comic book authors usually won't insult their readers to that extent. On the contrary, they tend to write with a level of logic and intelligence far above Tarantino.Production, acting, music, cinematography in the film are very good, but they can't counteract the insipid premise, plot, and overall concept. Speaking of music, the borrowed Morricone pieces are very good, but the rock, r&b, etc., are totally out of place and tear down the facade of a period piece.Similarly, Christoph Waltz as SS detective Hans Landa gave an amazing performance which was ruined by psychotic leaps out of character as written by Tarantino. Yes it showed Waltz's amazing acting range, but it also destroyed the integrity of his character.There are numerous ""artistic"" continuity errors in the film, no doubt created to give a cleaner looking shot. When Landa strangles von Hammersmark, both of their chairs mysteriously disappear. When Raine carves Landa's forehead, Landa's handcuffs disappear so he can grasp at the grass in pain, etc. Again this reinforces the notion that these are comics, and rather bad ones at that.",Inglourious Basterds,361748
46,szlachcic-49538,Tarantino at his best,10/10,14 April 2022,"This movie is a masterpiece. There is everything that a great movie needs: awesome humour (but the movie is not a comedy), great actors and the most important - the most terrifying villain in movies history, Hans Landa. Whenever he appears you can feel how scarred everyone else is, how smart he is and the actor gave his best playing him. Tarantino made a very radical, but marvelous decision that the movie is not in english - when french people talks they talk in french, germans in german etc. - the effect of that was just incredible amd you can feel how real this world is (i mean... Its Tarantino, he likes to change the history so it's not quiet real). It's awesome, go watch it, 10/10.

47,b_shaker333,Tarantino Delivers!!!,10/10,23 August 2009,"I must admit when I saw the preview for ""Inglorious Basterds"" I gave myself big expectations. THIS FILM DID NOT Disappoint.Rarely when I watch a movie with such high-expectations do I have those expectations met or exceeded; this film did that and more. Even more rarely do I clap at the end of a movie, this I and everyone else in the theater did.I have to say I am a little biased towards Quentin, I grew up with ""Pulp Fiction."" I watched it when I was 12 and it is still my favorite and most influential film.However, since then Quentin has not really lived up to his billing. His style was getting a little predictable instead of familiar, the quality honestly wasn't there (I never watched Jackie Brown, and then there's Grindhouse). That is until ""Inglorious Basterds."" What Quentin did was exactly what was needed for the war genre, a spaghetti western feel that could only be done by Tarantino or Sergio Leone, but seeing how Leone is dead, Tarantino's the self appointed guy on this masterpiece.So let's look at the movie which I won't give away. The writing was spot on, a beautiful transition between using not one but four different languages in this movie. Not to mention this movie was set up in the classic Tarantino mold, great scenes of rich meaningful dialog and sudden shocking action.The acting was superb!! Christopher Waltz deserves an Oscar, seriously. I don't say that often, but honestly the man should get one for this movie, he spoke every language in this movie, and delivered with such amazing touch and poise. He stole the show in a movie that everybody was amazingly impressive.I have no problem building this movie up, because this movie is the best film I've seen all year, and probably all of next year. Quite frankly the more I think about it, this movie may crack my top films of all time, and is Quentin's best movie since ""Pulp Fiction."" Take it from me, watch this film. I loved it doesn't do this movie enough justice.I watched it yesterday and I'm still blown away. Thank you Quentin from the bottom of my heart for you making this movie. You're back on top again buddy. I can't say enough for ""Inglorious Basterds!""",Inglourious Basterds,361748
48,xenolupa,I really don't understand why people like this movie,2/10,30 October 2009,"The acting is overacting. The plot does not exist. The story is completely unbelievable. This is fiction with over-fictional elements brought in a semi-serious setting. A farmer hiding Jews in the basement, being ""interrogated"" friendly by a Nazi, while the guards wait outside, they come in later and shoot them all and let one escape. That is a bad start. It is stupid. The stupidity does not end. This was not a funny movie, this was not satire, this was not entertainment, this was a long long list of stupid scenes, one unbelievable plot hole after another. An insult to history, an insult to every intelligent movie-lover. I was mad after seeing this. I really do not understand why people give compliments to this movie. Really.",Inglourious Basterds,361748
49,BA_Harrison,"Bold, brutal and brilliant.",9/10,22 May 2014,"Even though the title is virtually identical to Enzo G. Castellari's 1978 Italian warsploitation 'classic' The Inglourious Bastards, Quentin Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds is most definitely NOT a remake. Far from it. Not only is it one of Tarantino's more original efforts to date, but it also one of his best films for a long time, a riveting tale of derring-do that features plenty of everything that made his first two movies such a success: great dialogue, wonderful performances (Christoph Waltz is brilliant, as is an almost unrecognisable Mike Myers), excellent pacing, impressive direction, explosive violence, fantastic use of music, and more than a few playful visual touches of the kind that only Quentin seems to be able to get away with.Despite being fairly talky in places, with the bulk of the dialogue spoken in either German or French (and subtitled in English), the film is a thoroughly absorbing experience, with not a boring moment in its entire 153 minutes. The long conversational scenes are brilliantly executed and entertaining in their own right, but they also serve to make the violence seem even more explosive and brutal when it happens. And boy, is it nasty when it wants to be, with bloody scalpings, repeated baseball bat blows to the skull, and point-blank gunshots to the nether regions amongst the graphic carnage on display.It's not all typically cool Tarantino monologues and OTT gore, though: in an extremely bold move, the writer/director eventually steers events into fantastical territory, rewriting history to suit his whims. Those who have slated the film for its lack of historical accuracy are completely missing the point: Quentin is giving us his version of events, entertainment being the number one priority, facts be damned. It's daring movie-making and a whole lot of fun when approached with the right attitude.",Inglourious Basterds,361748
50,Fredolow,Downhill since PF,1/10,23 November 2009,"Seeing this film with an 8.5 rating beggars belief. Tarantino's finest moment was undoubtedly Pulp Fiction. Clever story, interesting characters, roller coaster ride and a well thought out, interwoven plot. This film is quite the opposite. Almost lazy. Weak and insulting script, AWFUL acting from Brad Pitt (embarrassingly bad given how much he's manage to shine in other, more challenging roles (i.e. Snatch), and predictable throughout. So, Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, and downhill ever since. Where's the spark gone? Or perhaps QT's just lost it for good. Pity.It seems many people these days are just happy to hail any old tripe he roles out as 'original and daring', when in reality it's quite the opposite - shallow and intellectually insulting. There were a couple of moments when the dialogue started to show some of the old sparkle, but generally (apart from the main German officer) performances were weak or, worse, comical. Each film he brings out I hope for a return to form, but what once was concentrate now just seems to be over-diluted tripe.",Inglourious Basterds,361748
51,coldwaterpdh,Top 250!? Are you kidding me???????,2/10,27 January 2010,"""Inglourious Basterds,"" a title which is stolen from a superior Italian trash flick by Enzo Castellari, is pure pretentious drivel.The opening scene of the movie is the only one which can compare to films from the glory days of Quentin Tarantino. The rest of the movie just descends down a long and boring hill and putters to a stop. It never builds any kind of strong characters. We are given a glimpse into ONE of the 'basterds' past but none of the others. It's like Tarantino said every few days of shooting: 'You know what would be freakin' kewl? If we did ....this....' It's all a jumbled mess with no theme even. It bounces from Spaghetti Western, to Italian Exploitation to Eastern martial arts and back around again. I got lost in the 'coolness' of it all.Brad Pitt who I happen to think is a fine actor, fell way short in this. His little southern accent gimmick wears off after about 10 minutes and his character just seems comical. And Eli Roth as 'the bear jew ?' What the heck is that!?This Tarantino guy just happens to be the ONLY film maker in Hollywood that is brash enough to steal from the masters (Leone, Fulci, Castellari, Argento, etc) and doesn't mind adding a dash of modern Hollywood lameness to it. It's ashame Americans are dumb enough to fall for it and we don't seem to have room in our hearts for more creativity in films these days.A total example of style over substance. It will not stand the test of time. I'll stick with the originals. Blue Underground releases a good handful every year! This is not a good movie. 2 out of 10, kids.",Inglourious Basterds,361748
52,allanharley01,Self indulgent and reliant on reputation,1/10,13 March 2010,"Reviews of this film are largely split into 2 camps; it's good because, or it's bad despite, it's direction by Tarantino.The question I asked myself after this was would this have been made without the Pitt/ Tarantino stamp? The answer was no; and the result was a film that made me so irate that I was moved to post my first review on IMDb...I found everything about this film treated the film goer with something approaching contempt. The script was thin with the exception of one well written character - Landa. Scripting for other characters was anodyne or non-existent, or, in the case of the ""Jew-Bear"", simply a bit weird. Same for the other aspects of characterisation, that was formulaic and thin in nearly every case, especially the made-for-Pitt Aldo Raine and the other Basterds. Style pastiching that normally works didn't; subject matter was treated with either insufficient levity or indifference; scenes were badly edited or irrelevant. The redeeming aspects were cinematography and production values - style over content.So - am I taking it too seriously? No; this is not a funny film (though occasionally it seems to try) and the violence that is shown sits uneasily between cartoonish and unnecessary - a prime example is that of the surrendered German who was beaten to death; added nothing, in any way. In fact the tone of the film was so inconsistent in the way it considered the material that it made me very uneasy.For me - Tarantino needs to start making films to impress others, not just himself. Obviously (most of) the rest of the world disagrees, but that's something either Mr T or I will have to learn to live with...One of the most disappointing films I've seen.",Inglourious Basterds,361748
53,rbrb,"Disaster Movie: probably the worst ""film"" I have ever seen....",1/10,18 August 2010,"Shame on IMDb saying this is a drama/thriller/war film. Nothing of the sort. ""Saving Private Ryan"" would come into that category, not this dreadful mess of a movie.It looks and feels like the writer/director so called has made it up as he goes along as the whole thing is uneven and drifts from drama to farce and various other genres.It is part parody, part fantasy, part black comedy(without being funny)and proved to be a total waste of my time and goodness knows why I did not bother to turn it off sooner. Brad Pitt is a complete embarrassment as he looks like he got out of his VIP chair to ad lib his role. And the actor playing Hitler is also an absolute joke but humorless.In brief the scenario is that a bunch of Jews in the 1940's go to get revenge on Nazi's, and the climax of this takes place in a cinema in Paris where all the German leaders will be present. The picture has unnecessary and needless violence, the plot and story are outrageously ridiculous and whilst Christopher Waltz steals the show even he cannot save this movie.Now have to ask rhetorically:Why do the members here give this movie over 8/10 on average? Further, why have are the box office takings almost twice the apparent budget? Seems that a few influential but totally out of touch film reviewers and some clever misleading marketing has duped a lot of people into believing there is some worth in this disaster of a movie.My verdict:What a load of rubbish,1/10",Inglourious Basterds,361748
54,robinhio84_,"I'm not a war film fan at all, but this is fantastic",9/10,19 March 2022,"From the moment this movie starts the score already gives an epic feeling. The first scene is so strong and somehow this level is maintained throughout the movie. Tarantino absolutely excels with this film. The story is great, but almost 2nd to the performance. Most actors are great, however it's Christoph Waltz that takes his role to the next level..One word of precaution: there is the quintessential Quentin level of violence mixed with outstanding dialogue. Think reservoir dogs.Personal Note: It's a film I watched coz of the IMDB 250 and I couldn't be happier. Without it; I would have probably not chosen to put it on that quickly. And this is one of those film that really gives credit to the quality of the list (with a few exceptions).

55,heisenberg83,Tarantino's best since Pulp Fiction - I absolutely loved it.,10/10,23 August 2009,"Just come out the cinema and felt the need to review this fabulous movie. I really didn't enjoy Tarantino's last movie (""Deathproof"") so I didn't enter this one with high expectations. But it was phenomenal. From the opening scenes, I could see Tarantino had taken the Sergio Leone formula (""The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly"") and cleverly transposed it into the WW2 era in Nazi-occupied France. In fact, the opening scenes at the milk farm are incredibly similar in tone and feel to the opening scenes of Leone's GBU. Every scene of this movie is beautifully shot and wonderful to watch. Tarantino has returned to form here and works the camera like a master. I was reminded of the kind of suspense you get from Alfred Hitchcock's best suspenseful scenes. Much of this movie is like that, an ever increasing build-up of suspense taking the audience to cracking point before letting off the steam. Brad Pitt's performance as Aldo Raines is terrific and leaves you begging for more, and the guy who played the main Nazi villain, and the cinema owner girl. All terrific. Even Eli Roth didn't bother me in his role which I thought he would. The use of movie music was great (especially BATTLE OF ALGIERS in the prison break scene) and moments of typical Tarantino humour made me smile throughout. I didn't know what was going to happen next and that's what makes a great movie for me. He has made a really top World War 2 movie here, without resorting to barely any clichés or action at all. I don't wanna give anything away but this has gone straight into my top 10 favourite movies of all time. Even the use of contemporary music (David Bowie for example) doesn't seem as odd as it sounds and works really well. I'll be getting the soundtrack and the DVD. Oh, and thanks for letting the Jews wins this one Tarantino, good man!",Inglourious Basterds,361748
56,RJBurke1942,Where Tarantino fantasizes about dirty war in war,4/10,18 February 2010,"Okay – here's the story, in a paragraph: a bunch of American soldiers terrorize German infantry for years, in France, behind enemy lines. They become infamous to the Nazis, resorting to intense cruelty to the Germans. Even der Führer wants them caught. Meanwhile, in a French town, a lovely French-Jewish femme fatale plans to blow up her cinema when a famous German action flick is shown to the German hierarchy – including Hitler, Goering, Goebbels and Borman. Coincidentally, those infamous American soldiers are sent to do the same job. Also, there's a very nasty Nazi colonel who just loves to hunt down and kill Jews – and he smells a rat in the House of Cinema. How it all turns out, I'll leave up to you to discover – that is, if you see this film.But, I don't recommend at all. Let me tell you why.First, it's billed as drama/thriller/war. Well, I guess it does contain all of those attributes, but they forgot about fantasy. Because, this story is, at core, a spoof about war and sheer fantasy, in addition.Second, in its effort to establish and develop character, it's often boring because it's way too talky for a thriller; you see character from what people do, not from what they say. Brad Pitt (as Aldo Raine) is okay as an over-the-top parody of hill-billy Americana – and he does it well. But, even his character becomes too talky. The nasty Nazi, Col. Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) is talky also, but at least he's a detective (in his own words), so he has to ask a lot of questions. The rest of the cast do their best with a script that varies between intense dread, only occasionally, to high camp, often – especially concerning the German hierarchy.Third, the whole story is preposterous. Let's face it – any war story that purports to show the entire German hierarchy being blown up in a cinema can only be regarded as coming from another planet Earth in another universe. And the (way too long) card game scene in the café basement is screechingly contrived coincidence and just too stupid for words. So, if you do see it, leave believability (the prime requirement for good stories, especially war) at the door. You've been warned.And, finally, although Quentin Tarantino started well with his filmic revelation, Reservoir Dogs (1992), and followed up with his much better Elmore Leonard story, Jackie Brown (1997) – his best to date – this one is his nadir, in my opinion. Technically very good, especially with the editing, this basterd of a story nevertheless kills the whole experience. If he was trying to show war in the raw, look no further than the battle scenes in The Thin Red Line (1998). If he was trying to create a thriller, stay with the Bourne franchise. If he was attempting drama in war, watch From Here to Eternity (1953) or Twelve O'Clock High (1949), and too many other superior films.To be fair, it has its moments: the frenetic shootout in the café basement is editing at its best. And the opening scenes at the French farm are a tour de force in building dread. However, the cardboard cutout characters left me totally indifferent to the fate of any of them: in sum, a dead story about death at its worst. It'll be interesting to see if Christoph Waltz gets the Oscar nod for Best Supporting Actor. Miracles do happen, though.I note that Roger Ebert gave it four stars. Is that out of ten? I hope so – I give it four also.Oh, heck, see it if you must, but just keep in mind it's a fantastic spoof.",Inglourious Basterds,361748
57,nikki_wire,Appalling,1/10,4 February 2010,"I simply cannot believe this movie's current rating on IMDb.It is currently sitting in the IMDb top 100, nestled closely with The Bridge on the River Kwai, Raging Bull and the Prestige.To find this movie in the same standing as those three is truly staggering to me. Hence I am taking the time to give this film 1 star, to hopefully help get it down towards its rightful place among the other pieces of truly worthless cinema with which it belongs.I can understand that this is a movie that you either love or hate - it is certainly true that it is both a provocative and original film. However, what surprises me is the massive bias towards the ""love"" side, given the film's content - which can be summarised as an unashamedly unrealistic and soulless collection of sadistic/casual mindless violence, strangely blended with dramatic scenes of the kind of things that genuinely took place under the Nazis.What I am trying to say is that combining very tense, well written SS interrogation scenes (which evoke some genuine emotional investment in the film) with comic book character British generals/Nazi leaders/Jewish soldiers makes for an extremely uncomfortable combination for me. At times it feels like someone has spliced together Schindlers List with Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.My best guess is that the film's originality and uncompromising approach is refreshing to people bored of the same old Hollywood formulae. Certainly the film is unpredictable. The plot (such as it is) is extremely meandering and many of the characters' actions are pretty much inexplicable. *SPOILER* (I point here towards Colonel Landa's killing of Bridget and his non-killing of Shosanna.) But then again every single character is so one dimensional that it leaves you with no idea which characters you are supposed to actually care about anyway. There is no real shock when anyone gets killed because you don't know who anyone is or what makes them tick.Brad Pitt gets the award here for the most wooden and pointless character to appear - he is truly awful throughout the film and finds himself in a role where he does not have to portray a single emotion throughout the film. Nothing.My final point is that originality on its own does not make a great film. Yes, Tarantino has made a movie where you see things that you have never seen before in a major Hollywood release, but that is not any sort of achievement. The reason a high budget film has not been made before where the entire German high command has a day at the cinema in occupied France with almost no guards or security is because that idea is stupid. Yes, the film is stupid - and no amount of brushing over with ""Tarantino is being postmodern"" or ""he's being ironic"" will overcome that plain fact.In summary this is a film that takes an exploitation film script, (that would ordinarily be filed under ""trash cinema"") gives it a big name director/very high quality cast and then takes the plaudits for being ground breaking.It is not. It is simply a steaming turd given a coat of gloss paint.",Inglourious Basterds,361748

The Russians were the only reason the world had survived and hadn't become a total Jew genocide.Was this film a joke, a comedy, a drama, or a parody? I didn't get that and I didn't like that. The end of the movie was absolutely terrible as it turned into a complete joke.This film is an abomination for spoiling the history and making a mockery out of people who truly fought to save the world.

Tarantino's chapter style with lots of characters sort of has to have consistent great moments, because it's missing something as a whole and this is a bit up and down.

60,jonathan-577,a master popularizer at his very best,10/10,7 September 2009,"Tarantino was never much of a philosopher, humanist, or world historian – just someone so utterly immersed in cinema that he could translate his obsession into terms that seemed not just relevant but also emotionally engaged. Now, at a rather troublesome and ambiguous moment, he takes on the Nazi film, with Bowery Jews and Southern lieutenants teaming up in a simple-minded crusade against Evil. In so doing, he offers more evidence that he's drinking from a bottomless well – that the movies can, and should, do anything. This is especially propitious since it comes along at a moment when cinema history is going down the toilet almost as fast as world history. More than ever he's playing the film prof here, but unlike his Americanism, his cinephilia is not triumphalist: he knows too much about his subject to lie about it. Glorious tributes to Sergio Leone and Raiders of the Lost Ark (and King Kong!!) vie with articulate digs at Pabst and Jannings and nitrate film. And yet it's anything but an in-crowd movie; I'm sure I don't get half the references myself. Instead, he sculpts these elements as a master popularizer, boiling them down into a teeming, bizarre concoction that is both devastating and offhand, manic yet full of grace, a jokester who delivers the punchline as if his life depended on it. And while you can always hear him talking, it's the overtones and cross-rhythms of his superbly attuned cast that bring it to life. This is as close to profundity as this man will ever get - pretty damn close.",Inglourious Basterds,361748
61,view_and_review,"Witty, Quirky, Violent",7/10,1 October 2021,"You really can't go wrong making an anti-Nazi war movie. I think that's the one war everyone pretty much agrees upon. Quentin Tarantino takes some liberties with historical occurrences and I'm not mad. Sometimes you have to tell the story how you wanted it to be even if it's not how it was.The Inglourious Basterds the movie is named after were a band of mostly Jewish-Americans taking the fight to the Nazis in France. They were led by Aldo (Brad Pitt), a Tennessee bred soldier who demanded Nazi scalps from his men. While the Basterds were fighting in their own unique fashion, a French Jewess who narrowly escaped slaughter was planning an attack of her own. While these two separate and capable parties were doing their thing, one SS officer seemed to be Johnny-on-the-spot for every plot. Col. Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) was the German Sherlock Holmes and his demise couldn't come soon enough.IB had Tarantino written all over it. It was witty, it was verbose, it was quirky, and it was violent.",Inglourious Basterds,361748
62,derwunderbaremandarin,A waste of time and money,1/10,23 February 2010,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.What is the purpose of this movie? A bunch of Americans enters Nazi-occupied France and starts slaughtering Germans. You see them scalping their enemies and beating them to death with baseball bats. While making jokes, of course.Some will say that this movie is a parody of a certain genre. For a parody, it is neither witty nor funny. The contents is zero. It is exceptionally brutal and disgusting. Underneath lies a subtle political message, because it is again ""the good guys"" killing ""bad Nazis"". The whole plot is unthinkable if you turn it around. Could you imagine a storyline where Nazis (while making jokes) kill everybody in the Warsaw ghetto with flamethrowers? Probably not, but this movie is exactly about that, with the exception that is satisfies the weird moral expectations of a certain audience: slaughtering people is so cool when done by the right people.This movie only works because of the hidden Nazi-ideology underneath. It does not regard the enemy as people. And if the latter is supposed to be an element of the fun, I am happy to say that this kind of fun will always remain a mystery to me.Another mystery is how such violence can fascinate the American crowd while a bit of nudity will freak them out. But if a naked body is pornography, this movie with all its brutality is pure pornography at its very worst.Inglorious Basterds is a pointless, boring and tasteless waste of time and money.",Inglourious Basterds,361748
63,sssalem,Very disappointing,1/10,23 October 2009,"Seriously disappointing performance by Brad Pitt and Q T, the plot is very superficial and lame, and, unless indirectly intended, this film actually glorify the Nazis and portrays them as men of honor, and show that the Jewish people are deceiving, cant keep promises and bloody vicious. ((THE FOLLOWING CONTAINS SPOILER)) Hitler together with the most notorious Nazis are attending a stupid plot less movie about the killing of 300 Italian soldiers in a small cinema theater in Paris is unbelievably ridiculous. the Nazis laughing and hooraying each killing in the movie as if watching a basketball game STUPID, the deal at the end is lame. whats really appalling is that the movie earned great reviews and is ranked here in the 40s amongst the greatest 250 films. will not be surprised if it harvested many awards, including Oscars, as well. the movie is simply a kissing ass to the Jewish people, but hey reconsider, its not even doing a great job doing that. it truly dwarfed the whole Nazi - Jews conflict and a pure insult to all who fought and suffered from the tyranny of the Nazis.",Inglourious Basterds,361748

He was made to look goofy but I didn't laugh once at this stinking dog turd.Anyone who rates this crap as even good needs their head testing or needs to stop licking Tarantinos backside.Kill Bill 1 and 2 sucked as well.

65,madbeast,A disgusting travesty,1/10,30 August 2009,"This is a disgusting travesty of a film that does its best to re-imagine the Holocaust as a comic book that was conceived by a 12-year old boy. There are a myriad of films that portray World War II in a fanciful light, but ""Inglorious Basterds"" is one of the few that I can recall that uses the extermination of the Jews as a launching pad for an outlandish Sam Peckenpaugh -inspired cartoon which depicts historical figures like Adolph Hitler and Joseph Goebbels - monsters who were responsible for the murder of millions of people - on the same level as Lex Luthor or The Joker.Brad Pitt and his crew of seemingly invincible marauders cut through the German lines with such ease that it's a wonder that the war lasted as long as it did, and with such a sadistic bloodthirstiness that they seemed likely subjects for a war crimes trial at the conflict's end. Tarantino crudely and artlessly tries to take the narrative between their bloody and far-fetched ""heroics"" and more genuine atrocities suffered by victims of the Nazis, so the line between Tarantino's outlandish fairy tale and the real-life horrors of the Holocaust are blurred to a degree that made me feel like the director was exploiting the brutal death of six million people in order to splash a lot of cool, fake blood on a movie set. That's perfectly fine if you're making a flight of fantasy like ""Kill Bill"", but the blood that was spilled in the Holocaust wasn't supplied by Hollywood special effects wizards and deserves more respect than it's given here.",Inglourious Basterds,361748
66,Prichards12345,"Slow and often stupid, but with some good acting",6/10,29 August 2010,"Tarantino has produced a movie that is something of a curio, a would-be action movie without much action, long stretches of dialogue which sometimes work and other times merely bore, and acting which ranges from brilliant to terrible.Brad Pitt, the leader of the Nazi hunters, is a cross between Ged Clampitt and Bruce Forsyth! He is bloody awful. Christopher Waltz, who plays Eric Lander, an SS ""Jew Hunter"" is terrific though, as is Melanie Laurent who coveys a wide range of emotions while saying little. Haven't a clue what Mike Myers was doing in the film; cod British accents are fine for comedy; here he was just crap. The movie does have a long but excellent opening scene and a great last 30 minutes, problem is it takes too long to shift gears - the cellar scene in the bar is overlong and pretty stupid - crack behind enemy lines troops agree to meet in a cellar full of German soldiers???? Tarantino even brings up the stupidity several times but never answers it - why not just meet in a park or a hotel or something? Answer of course is so Tarantino can do a Mexican standoff...where the only survivor is someone who's vital to the plan. Yeah, right. Our crack team are actually extremely thick, as they leave evidence around all pointing to her as an enemy agent, and then come up with an explanation for the plaster cast which is so stupid the guy who wrote Springtime For Hitler would have seen through it. Would never have happened in Richard Burton's day!I liked the fact that they actually kill Hitler et al! Although two guards for the German High Command in occupied France which has been invaded by the allies is a bit weak. It's strange that the film seems to go out of the way to avoid action while containing much off the cuff violence; and seriously under-develops the basterds, while lots of time is given over to more minor characters. I liked the German sharpshooter, though, and overall a good film - just not as good as Tarantino can be. A two out of four stars movie for me.",Inglourious Basterds,361748
67,imseeg,"Somewhat silly plot, but nevertheless quite good suspense and juicy acting performances.",8/10,23 January 2020,"Brad Pitt is undercover in Nazi Germany during World War II with a secret mission to kill Hitler. Will he succeed or die trying?The bad: this plot is rather silly at key moments, because some events that take place are simply not true to life or highly unlikely. Dont wanna nag about that flaw too much though, but it is a thing that bugs me nevertheless and it makes me only wanna award it with 8 stars, instead of 9 or 10.The good: the suspense is terrific. Tarantino is a master at building up suspense in long lasting scenes. The dialogues and characters are to die for, ranging from violently wicked to hilariously stupid.This is one of my favourite Tarantino movies of the last 20 years. It nowhere near equals Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs or Jackie Brown, but it comes close. Seen it many many times and I will enjoy it many more times to come.",Inglourious Basterds,361748
68,Quebec_Dragon,Bring on the hate,4/10,5 October 2009,"I might be one of the only people crying foul but aren't we getting diminishing returns with Tarantino since Kill Bill 2 ? I was majorly disappointed with Inglourious Basterds. I found the film weak, unsatisfying and plain long. It seems that Tarantino is writing longer and longer (and longer) conversation pieces or monologues about mundane or inane subjects with a very short (or no) payoff at the end. In his earlier filmography, those parts used to be clever, somewhat brilliant despite their outward superficiality but he did limit them, pace them better and they were nowhere near as self-indulgent as in Basterds. He relies on the quality of his actors to keep our collective interest but that can only go so far. I suppose those drawn-out conversations can build up a certain tension if you're patient enough and that Tarantino delights in doing the unexpected even with characters you think might be major. I'll give him some credit for subverting usual movie clichés, which might be due to his extensive movie knowledge.Regarding the featured Basterds commando, they were a disappointment. Besides their leader (Brad Pitt's character) who sounds and looks more like a southern redneck than a Jewish American, the other members of the commando have extremely little screen time, even less talking time and zero personality. Being angry and killing Nazis with a baseball bat is not good characterization. If you were expecting some kind of over-the-top revenge trip on Nazis by the Jews, you'll get very little satisfaction even at the end as the Jews themselves are basically superfluous. I would argue that the German characters shown here are, in general, more interesting, likable and/or multifaceted. You almost feel sorry for some of them (which perhaps was Tarentino's intention but then he should have worked more on the Jewish characters to compensate). The actions scenes are usually quick and cringe-worthy with a longer set-piece at the end that was not particularly exhilarating or well shot. I know violence in real life is probably like that but their shortness was accentuated by the very static overly long conversations.The most memorable character by far is the SS colonel Hans Landa. Beyond his amazing linguistic skills (my native language is french and his was very good), you'll enjoy his suave friendly unpredictable antics. He manages to make extremely long conversations somewhat bearable through sheer screen presence. I also liked very much Brad Pitt's enthusiastic and fun portrayal of Aldo Raine even though he's caricatured and not particularly believable. The 2 characters above are mostly responsible for the few funny bits. The cast in general was very good especially the 2 female leading roles. Certain trends (or trademarks) in Tarentino's film-making are getting worse and you should avoid this if you're looking for great action, comedy or war film unless you're really keen on overlong Tarentino-type dialogue and want to see great multilingual acting.Rating: 4 out of 10",Inglourious Basterds,361748
69,Tweekums,Tarantino's War Movie,9/10,4 March 2017,"This wartime movie follows two separate stories that are destined to meet in the final scenes. In the first Col. Hans 'The Jew Hunter' Landa enters a French farm house and, after talking to the farmer for some time, shoots the Jewish family he was hiding; one of them, eighteen year old Shosanna, manages to escape. When we next see her it is 1944 and she is running a cinema in Paris. Here she catches the eye of a young German soldier; she isn't interested in him but it turns out he is famous amongst the Germans thanks to his exploits as a sniper. A film has been made about him and he wants the premiere to take place in her cinema with all the top brass in attendance she sees this as an opportunity to avenge her family's murder. Meanwhile the second story follows a small group of Jewish American soldiers, nicknamed the 'Inglourious Basterds', who are working deep inside enemy territory killing any Germans they can get their hands on. When British Military Intelligence learns of the film premiere this group are brought into a plot to blow up the cinema with the help of a German actress, Bridget von Hammersmark, who has been working as a double agent. As the big night approaches it emerges that Adolf Hitler himself will be in attendance along with other senior Nazis if everything goes to plan the war could end in 1944.If you like your war stories to fit in with real history you might find this rather annoying as some real people who did not die in 1944 end up dead in this film if however you are looking for a cracking war film with a good amount of action, some very tense scenes and a spectacular finale you could do a lot worse than this. The film opens more like a spaghetti western than a war film with the Germans arriving at a remote farmhouse. Here Landa and the farmer just talk for the first twenty minutes of the film the tension gradually rising as we wait for something to happen. Christoph Waltz is delightfully menacing without ever issuing a direct threat or raising his voice; in this scene and for most of the movie. After this prologue things get more interesting as we switch between the two plots to kill Nazis at the cinema; at any time either could be exposed or they could somehow ruin the other's scheme. Given that Tarantino's previous films are pretty bloody I expected this to be very violent but it isn't excessively; there are indeed moments of violence but more often there is just the feeling that something violent is about to happen; when it does it is short and bloody. The cast do a fine job; as well as the aforementioned Christoph Waltz there are great performances from Brad Pitt as the leader of the titular 'Inglourious Basterds', Mélanie Laurent as Shosanna and Diane Kruger as Bridget von Hammersmark. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to fans of Tarantino's earlier films as well as people looking for a thrilling war movie.",Inglourious Basterds,361748
70,comps-784-38265,Rotting faeces masquerading as 'Tarentino Art',3/10,17 August 2017,"The luvvy darlings have all slapped Tarentio luvvy on the back on told him he's a writing/directing genius. Unfortunately this is not the case.If you are going to re-write history in a film, you need to pick a period outside of living memory. Otherwise a lot of the audience will know it's not just inaccurate, but blatantly so. This rather kills the illusion, by slapping the viewer, with a smelly cold wet fish of disbelief for what they are seeing. I liked some of Tarantino's other films, but this seems to be one where he scribbled the script on loo paper whilst high on drugs or alcohol. Fassbender excels as does Waltz (Pitt is just a poster boy and hardly seen!) but the film is so patchy and jerky you never get into any story, just long periods of tedious scenes and dialogue. Watch once (if you have no other choice) and never, ever, ever again.",Inglourious Basterds,361748
71,kols,"First of all, Pitt's accent ...",1/10,30 May 2016,"Texas? Brooklyn? Midwestern? Couldn't tell but whatever it is irritated me greatly as an affectation.Then there's both plot and story - not so much as plot and story (fantasy is fantasy) but their presentation, which struck me as pretty much being on the same level of affectation as Pitt's accent.Same with script, cinematography, characters, soundtrack, acting and anything else I may have left off.Now I can see how one could see this as a ridiculously off the wall parody of a war/cum spy movie but, as such, it just irritated me - neither plot nor story made sense, none of the characters were engaging and none of the 'bits' - like the German officer trying to negotiate medals, position and pay for allowing the bomb plot to go off - worked. For me.Given the movie's success and rave reviews, mine is obviously a minority opinion. Which is fine and congratulations to all of you who enjoyed it. Just as I found it a weird exercise in slightly ugly pointlessness, it is fitting that if it does work for others, it works. That is the nature of any work of the imagination, that both viewpoints are valid.",Inglourious Basterds,361748
72,laurylou-1,Waltz is a Genius!!!!!,10/10,23 July 2009,"I had the PRIVILEGE of attending the UK premier of Inglorious Basterds this evening! Having seen the trailers i had high hopes but had doubts due to a string of self indulgent films (c'mon lets be honest, self indulgence is his tarantinos middle name)I was surprised to find though that he had pulled the cat out of the bag with this one. The film is rich with interesting dialogue, Perfect timed comedy with a dash of brutal assassination.The crowning glory of this film though lies with Christoph Waltz whom no fault or error can be found. He manages to create a real tension in the audience whilst remaining quite ""theatrical"" (couldn't think of a better word). He definitely deserved his prize at Cannes and is heading for an Oscar no doubt!!!! Hoping to see him in something again soon!

73,Turfseer,Tarrantino shoots himself in the foot as 'Basterds' devolves into puerile wish fulfillment fantasy,5/10,31 August 2009,"Inglourious Basterds is Quentin Tarrantino's homage to the entertaining World War II action films of the 60s and 70s. Of all such films, 'Basterds' mostly resembles the highly entertaining ""The Dirty Dozen"". In 'Chapter 1' (unquestionably the best scene in the movie), Tarrantino raises his 'Dirty Dozen' to a higher plane. In his World War II epic, the Nazis' hatred of the Jews is not ignored (unlike these earlier action films). At the outset, Tarrantino's SS man, Landa, is wholly believable as the charming sadist who ends up murdering a Jewish family hidden under the floorboards of a French dairy farmer's home. Like many of the scenes in the film, the opening scene is dialogue heavy but the tension is so palpable that one sits engrossed until the scene's brutal and harrowing outcome.The reason why 'The Dirty Dozen' was so entertaining was that each convict 'misfit' had a distinct and extremely interesting personality. Tarrantino doesn't bother to develop any of his basterds as fleshed out people. Instead, all they can do is scalp Nazis or as one of them does (the so-called 'Bear Jew') beats Nazi brains out with a baseball bat. What's more, Tarrantino doesn't bother showing how they develop as a team and how they overcome obstacles leading to their reputation as professional killers. Instead, they're plopped down in occupied France and meet no real resistance. The whole charm of 'The Dirty Dozen' was that that they had to overcome not only the external obstacles of fighting the Nazis but deal with their own internal strife. In short, they were fairly plausible, believable characters. Not so with Tarrantino's group who are not only unbelievable but unsympathetic (they're as sadistic as their Nazi opponents).The problem with Tarrantino's narrative is that it gradually becomes more and more implausible and incoherent. I was willing to suspend my disbelief when Shoshanna, the Jewish girl, escapes while Landa murders her family (did his gun jam?) but how does she become the owner of a movie theater a few years later? Wouldn't the Nazis have uncovered her Jewish heritage? Tarrantino's portrait of Goebbals as a dilettante in the world of German cinema rang true but I question the assertion that he was the #2 man (next to Hitler) in the Nazi hierarchy (certainly Bormann, Heydrich and Goring had a lot more power).Visually, it was a nice touch in showing Hitler with an unflattering complexion as well as making fun of his out of control temper; but to reduce Hitler to a complete buffoon while other Nazi characters are quite believably scary, makes no sense whatsoever. Hitler, after all, was the brains behind the operation.Tarrantino does serve up some juicy characters which were highly entertaining. I liked Pvt. Fredrick Zoller (Daniel Bruhl) as he first appears to be a harmless, lovesick puppy dog, enamored with our Jewish cinema owner and actually exudes modesty despite having become a war hero and accidental movie star. And it makes perfect sense for him to morph into a sadistic stalker on the verge of rape when he shows his 'true colors' after confronting Shoshanna in the projection booth. In some ways, Zoller is more sinister than Landa.Kudos also to Diane Kruger as Bridget Hammersmark, the movie actress who's also a double agent. Despite its unpleasantness, the scene of Kruger's demise at the hands of the sadistic Landa pulls you in. Perhaps the best character in the movie is Major Dieter Hellstrom, played by the brilliant August Diehl, who ends up exposing Michael Fassbender's film critic turned spy in the basement tavern face-off. The way Tarrantino has the diabolical Major deduce it's 'King Kong' during the card game is utterly brilliant. Through Hellstrom's 'deduction', Tarrantino demonstrates that he has a profound understanding of the sinister nature of Nazi politics and ideology.Tarrantino, however, shoots himself in the foot in the final third of the movie. The Basterds are supposed to be a crackerjack professional outfit but allow themselves to be easily apprehended at the film premiere because no one speaks any languages except English. And despite Hitler showing up at the premiere, there's absolutely no security (Shoshanna's black lover who plans to set fire to the building has free rein to walk around without being stopped once). In Tarrantino's warped universe, he somehow feels some kind of perverse satisfaction in having Shoshanna laugh at the Nazis as they are being burned to a crisp in an on screen rant. Finally, what really killed the film for me was the denouement where the sinister and charming Landa suddenly becomes a blithering idiot by offering to surrender to the Allies after allowing the Basterds' bomb plot to proceed. How could the ""Hangman"" of Occupied France suddenly deceive himself into believing that Lt. Aldo Raine, the notorious Nazi killer, would agree to his ludicrous demands and then keep his word?Inglorious Basterds contains a plethora of clever references to the history of cinema. Many of the scenes are overlong and talky but the dialogue is always crisp and never boring. Tarrantino's characters are a mixed bag—he's much more successful with his Nazi antagonists than his American protagonists. Particularly disappointing is Brad Pitt who has little to do except practice a Southern accent. With the exception of Hitler and SS Landa's final scenes, Tarrantino does a credible job of humanizing his Nazis. That doesn't mean he approves of them but it shows he knows what makes them tick. Tarrantino should have consulted with Daniel Mendelsohn before making his mad revenge fantasy. Mendelsohn, writing in Newsweek, gets it right: ""An alternative, and morally superior, form of ""revenge"" for Jews would be to do precisely what Jews have been doing since World War II ended: that is, to preserve and perpetuate the memory of the destruction that was visited upon them, precisely in order to help prevent the recurrence of such mass horrors in the future.""",Inglourious Basterds,361748
74,webcrind,Only in a sick society can a guy like Tarantino make any money.,1/10,26 September 2009,"I will make it short: Tarantino is a very sick individual, no doubt. He has no sense for timing, he steals of other ( better) directors like it would be virtuous, and he absolutely knows nothing about WWII. Brad Pitt, who is one of my favourite actors, simply stank. His accent was awful and he overacted like an amateur. The scene where his bluff of being an Italian should have been called, but for some weird reason is not, is absolutely laughable, but nevertheless not funny.We were a bunch of guys watching that movie and none, seriously none liked it. I firmly believe that Tarantino is in love with himself and that shows what bad taste he has.

77,chandean-69762,Inglorious Basterds 2009 Review,8/10,1 March 2021,"Tarantino does it again. Although not my favorite Tanantino film, it's still really great!
If you've seen any of his previous work you know exactly what to expect.
Inglorious Basterds does some masterful buildup. It all builds up to that finale, which is satisfying and so worth the 2 hour wait.
Within the two hours before the finale contains some of the best character building i've seen, with some great acting (as usual, Tarantino knows exactly who he wants) that just make the film come alive. That combined with some tense action and some extremely suspenseful moments keep you on your toes the entire time. There's even a lot of humor in this which I wasn't expecting!Personally there are some points that I felt dragged, but I feel like this will be even better with a second watch, and make most of those moments feel more meaningful.

79,chadlund,Most overrated movie of the 21st Century,1/10,12 June 2016,"Tarantino is so full of himself, but the only achievement I can acknowledge is that he has reached unconditional praise and success for movies that are vastly overrated, severely violent, so incoherent that they should be changed to fantasy genre because of their lack of realism.Inglorious Bastards is basically Ocean's Eleven remake with violence and 100% ego displayed. There's no story, it's not funny, nobody is even trying to act.I don't have a problem with directing a comedy about WWII - after all, the Grande Vadrouille is a sensational and hysterical movie, that manages to ignore completely the gravity of the war and the occupation. Why ? Precisely because it is a real comedy. All the fundamental laws for directing a movie are missing, it's alarming.",Inglourious Basterds,361748
80,gregeichelberger,Typical Tarantino overwhelms World War II fantasy,4/10,12 August 2009,"Whenever I view a Quentin Tarantino film I expect a quirky plot, decent acting and a cool soundtrack. Unfortunately, I also expect non-existent pacing, a confusing narrative and long, drawn-out talking sequences.You get plenty of the above with his newest effort, the revenge fantasy, ""Inglourious Basterds, a remake of the 1978 Italian picture, ""Bastardi Senza Gloria"" (literally ""Bastards Without Glory""). It's ""The Dirty Dozen"" meets ""Valkyrie"" meets ""Kill Bill"" and tells the story of a small band of Jewish-American guerrilla soldiers who are dropped behind enemy lines in German-occupied France and strike fear in the hearts of Hitler's military.Led by Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt), the group accomplishes this by raids and ambushes in which dead German soldiers are scalped (in some very gruesome scenes) and survivors have swastikas carved into their foreheads (think younger, more Teutonic versions of Charles Manson). While there are eight of these commandos, the two most interesting are Pfc. Omar ""The Bear Jew"" Ulmer (Omar), who beats Nazis with baseball bats; and Sgt. Hugo Stiglitz (Til Schweiger), an ex-Wehrmacht soldier who killed a dozen of his own troops.The trailers for the movie are really pushing this plot line, but that's a false premise. There are really only a few scenes of such carnage, instead the story revolves mostly around a lisping SS colonel, Hans ""The Jew-Hunter"" Landa (Christoph Waltz, a German actor appearing in a rare U.S. production) and a French Jew, Soshanna Dreyfus (Mélanie Laurent, a French actress appearing in a rare U.S. production), whose family Landa had killed.She owns a movie house in Paris and becomes acquainted with Frederick Zoller (Daniel Brühl), a war hero who supposedly killed over 100 U.S. soldiers in Italy. A film of this exploit, ""A Nation's Pride,"" was made by Nazi Minister of Propaganda, Josef Goebbels (Sylvester Groth). Of course, the premier of this film will take place at the picture show.Also complicating matters is a British spy, Lt. Archie Hicox (Michael Fassbender) who is unintentionally hilariously briefed by Michael Myers (doing his worst Group Capt. Lionel Mandrake impersonation) and Winston Churchill (Rod Taylor, ""The Time Machine,"" ""The Birds""). Then, there's another subplot which has the Fuerher himself (Martin Wuttke) possibly attending the premier.To complete these various story lines, Tarantino falls back on his habit of filming scene after scene of people sitting around tables, talking, talking and talking (see ""Grindhouse's Death Car""). Talking in taverns, talking in houses, talking in war rooms, talking in basements, talking in prisons. Mr. Tarantino, there is a person who toils on every film set that ever existed - this person called an ""editor."" Please make use of this person.These sequences swallow up about 80 percent of the movie's 2-hour, 30-minute running time and leave precious little time for Pitt, who does well, albeit with a bad Southern accent, and his mercenaries.There some good things about the film, however. The sets and costumes are wonderful and quite accurate as far as period detail goes; the location cinematography by Robert Richardson (""The Aviator,"" ""Kill Bill, Vols. 1 and 2"") is terrific; the movie uses authentic German, French and Italian (with subtitles); and Tarrantino knows his German cinema history, dropping names like Lili Riefenstahl, P.W. Pabst and Emil Jannings.A good surgeon could have removed about 45-minutes from this movie, though, added a few more scenes of the Basterds and toned down the David Bowie. Then, it might have been the taut, compelling film I thought it could be.",Inglourious Basterds,361748
81,dbborroughs,Okay send up of the Euro-war film is for fans of Tarantino's dialog only,4/10,23 August 2009,"Quentin Tarantino's painfully over long World War Two film that started as a remake of Enzo G. Castellari's Inglorious Bastards, but which changed over time to this monster of a movie.The plot has a band of American soldiers, all Jewish, operating behind enemy lines killing Nazi's when the opportunity comes to work with a British officer who's job it is to kill a large portion of the high command at a film premiere in Paris.The film is essentially a long winded send up, you can't take anything in this film seriously so its a send up, of the Euro- war films of the 1970's and 80's. Indeed the film that the movie takes its name from is from 1978. To be certain the film has better production values than most of the films that he is sending up but it isn't all that much better than the most mediocre of the genre.What went wrong? Tarantino is what what went wrong. To be certain Tarantino knows his war films and the film very often feels like it fits very nicely in the genre, I'm currently going through a good number of Italian war films and from a feel point of view this film does get it right. His rip offs and borrows, of which there are many, mostly work (even if they frequently break the mood).The problem is Tarantino's attitude is more is more. This is all well and good, except that the films he is sending up are at least an hour shorter than this behemoth. This film drones on for two and a half hours. It never seems to end. Actually it never seems to get going. Honestly the film is well over an hour in before the film even begins to start to move, and even that it does slowly. I kept wanting to hit the remote to get to the point where it gets moving.What is the deal with this film. Its a war film with very little action. Most of this film are these long, painfully long, sequences where the characters just sit around and talk. The opening introduction of Christoph Waltz's Col Lada is twenty minutes long. Yea it plays out in essentially real time, but at the same time I screamed ""get on with it"" at the screen (yes I was shushed) because there really was no point. Actually there is little point to much of the dialog. This is a film that could be trimmed by at least an hour and lose nothing but inane dialog. (Your ultimate love or hate for the film will depend upon whether you like Tarantino's penchant for long rambling dialog exchanges that goes nowhere, or if not nowhere drone on way past the point of what is really required and serve no point beyond showing how well he can write).Which brings me back to the idea that this is an action film. How much action is there? Very little. The shoot out in the bar, the end, the introduction of the band at the train bridge (maybe thats an action scene) and maybe one other sequence, the rest is talk. To me the film felt mostly inert. Its not a film that slowly builds only to have the tension released in an orgy of violence, rather its rambling nonsense punctuated by an occasional scalping. If you really want to be fair you'd have to say that this film is static in away no Euro-war film- other than a concentration camp exploitation film- ever was.I'm curious what the tone of the film is suppose to be. After the too long but tense introduction of Lada and Shoshana, the film jumps to Brad Pitt talking to his men about what is expected of them (100 scalps). Its fall down funny. Its so over the top that you can't take anything that happens after that even remotely seriously. Forgive me it sinks the film since every time Aldo Raine comes on screen or is heard the film falls into silliness. You'll have a serious sequence and then Pitt comes on and spoils the mood.Its also troubling. Its troubling because I'm not sure what I'm suppose to take away from the film. Clearly the jovial attitude is suppose to make it easier to root for the good guys, but at the same time what they do, often in a joking manner, isn't funny. I don't think the Nazi's do anything other than shoot people, the good guys scalp people, cut their throats and beat their heads in with a baseball bat while their comrades cheer and dance around. These are the good guys? I don't think Tarantino was going for the same effect that James Dickey was going for with his novel To the White Sea (the film of which had Pitt attached) since there are too many jokes. I'm sorry the implications of what the heroes are bothers me.I do have to say that the performances, outside of the Basterds who are just too over the top, are for the most part very good. I was very impressed by Michael Meyers who has a solid cameo as a British general.Do I like the film? Kind of, but not really. Its better than I thought, but not as good as it should have been. Its a bloated approximation of the Euro-war film. Tarantino has beefed it up and disjointed it in the way that an over-imaginative five year old who is making up his own story would do. Unfortunately for Tarantino the plots of many of the films he's sending up, I will not say paying homage, are so close to parody already that he's pushed it all in the wrong direction. He's done better, and he's done worse.I can't really recommend it since its too long for what it is. Wait for DVD or cable",Inglourious Basterds,361748
82,advaithrsn,Don't know what kept me from watching this before,10/10,10 September 2022,"A fantastic film, which has an espionage feel to it along with graphic violence and gore, which I personally love watching (especially evil people getting butchered and shot gorily and stuff).This has some of the best performances I have seen from any actor. Brad Pitt did a spectacular job and that accent of his made it more entertaining (don't know if he nailed the accent or not). Melanie Laurent also played her role to perfection. Though being an ensemble piece, the show stealer for me is Christoph Waltz. Man, he had such a great screen presence and I couldn't picture anyone else playing that role! There were no weak links whatsoever. This movie is conversation-driven for the majority of its duration, but was thoroughly engaging and well-written. Cinematography, sound design and VFX were top notch. Another major plus point is the costuming and make-up, though minimalistic and nothing extravagant, but must have been thoroughly difficult to nail it, as simple make-up and costuming often proves to be the most difficult to get it right. The set designs also gave the feel of the 1940's era.A must-watch for all the people who love intense character-driven stories along with occasional gore and bloodshed. A solid 10/10 from my side!",Inglourious Basterds,361748
83,doughelo,I don't know WHAT this film was supposed to be,1/10,1 April 2010,"This was by far the worst and sickest Tarantino film I've seen, and I've seen all but one. It's an ungainly mix of cartoony revenge fantasy and sub-Eli Roth torture porn. The Basterds roam around France without any apparent source of supplies, ammunition, or command of any language other than English. Their actions are hideous, scalping bodies (with vivid sound effects and exposed brains), carving swastikas in foreheads..slowly.., sticking fingers in bullet holes, yet these are the good guys and the torture is played for laughs. Tarantino doesn't know any difference between ordinary (e.g. drafted) German soldiers and Nazis, and thus any amount of carving up is OK as long as it's done by Jews or their redneck leader. I guess he thinks it'd be equally OK if the Germans scalped American bodies and carved stars in their foreheads? Tarantino is good at dialog and set pieces, but fails to weave them together into a coherent narrative. There are basically two revenge fantasies coming together in the Paris movie premiere, but neither one affects the other. There is zero character establishment or development. We're not told how a penniless Jewish girl came to own a fabulous movie theater a few years later in occupied Paris, or even how she established a false identity. None of the Basterds have separable personalities or life histories (we don't even find out why Aldo has a rope burn on his neck). Compare and contrast with ""The Dirty Dozen.""The climactic premiere sequence is so absurd it's not even laughable. Sometime after the Allied invasion (which is never referred to, although we've been told it's June 1944), the entire German high command takes off for a gala film event in Paris, about 300 miles from the front lines (it's not like they had any pressing business). At the theater, Hitler is protected by a grand total of TWO guards. When you can't even be as realistic as a Mel Brooks movie (""To Be or Not To Be""), you're just insulting the audience. I've seen better security at the library.Hmm, what else? Why aren't the Basterds surprised when the theater catches on fire? That wasn't part of their plan. Why did Landa completely lose control and strangle the actress? It's wildly out of character from every other scene. If he's angry she's a traitor, he already has it in mind to become an even bigger traitor himself. Why does every German they meet speak English? What was the point of scalping the driver at the end? The war was about to be over, who were they trying to freak out? Does Tarantino even know what Goebbels looked like?I could go on, but it's like picking apart the physics of Bugs Bunny. It's a spectacle of Tarantino acting out his man-child, which unfortunately gets taken as a daring alternate history.",Inglourious Basterds,361748
84,tobydale,Disappointing to the point of irritation,5/10,15 November 2010,"First of all let me say that in general I'm a big fan of Quentin Tarantino movies. But this one left me cold. I've given it a day or 2 to think about it and I've decided that this is not a very good film.Now we all know that Tarantino knows his cellulose - and there is homage throughout all of his movies to some of the greatest films of all time. We know already Quentin! Why keep doing it! Isn't it about time you moved on? For me the worst point of this movie was its counterfactual content. Everyone of a certain age and intelligence knows that Hitler blew his brains out in a bunker in Berlin in 1945. But I wouldn't mind betting that many watchers would have skipped out of the cinema thinking that World War II came to an end in 1944 because of some huge explosion in a cinema! Not so.Now defenders of this movie will probably claim that ""it's an art movie - anything goes"". Okay fine. But it is still a movie. Art films don't have to be counterfactual, but they can be fictional, example, Babettes Feast, Jean de Florette, Once upon a time in the West, they still tell stories fantastically well and look brilliant. You can also have art movies that are factual, for example, the Passion of Joan of Arc, Amadeus. These are some great movies! But Inglorious Basterds doesn't hold a candle to any of these - not even in the same league. Why? On this showing Tarantino has reduced the war movie to a comedy. It's a very odd comedy, a violent comedy, a character's larger-than-life comedy. But it's a comedy nonetheless.Tarantino is trying to do a lot of things with this film. For one thing, he is making a statement about the power of film and its propaganda qualities. For another he's trying to say, "" yeah, the Jews had it rough"". Yes Quintin, we know already. He's also trying to say people will sell each other out if the price is right. Okay, we know. You told us before.The film just doesn't hang together. But then Tarantino films can have separate stories running within them, Pulp Fiction being the classic of this type. Pulp Fiction contains larger-than-life characters and is hysterically funny. I didn't want for this movie to be a comedy especially since it begins with the brazen ( and predictable) murder of a basement full of Jews hiding from the Nazis. Okay Quentin you got my attention. But then the film descends into comedy and parody and homage and we've seen it all before.One thing you can say about this film is that it is full of tension - there are long scenes with dialogue. Always nice in a movie that - dialogue, and usually Tarantino films have quite good dialogue. But this just doesn't go anywhere - it's just unbelievable silly nonsense. The only character we care about - Soshanna - is somewhat surprisingly gunned down.Tarantino is a very gifted filmmaker and storyteller. But I think he needs to get over himself. He needs to stop taking the film watcher for granted. Even the music, good though it is, is borrowed. War has in the past been been a vehicle to some of the greatest movies ever made. But this most certainly is not one of them. Disappointing.",Inglourious Basterds,361748

86,qnpjvscnw,Not that great,4/10,1 May 2023,"Just another terrentino film trying to be a western with over the top gratuitous violence to try and shock the audience. The story is basic and contrived. It's not that the acting is bad given the material - they do the best they have to work with but to call this a great or good film doesn't make a lot of sense. There is no special underlying message. Just a lot of violence for the sake of violence and to satisfy Quentin's strange fascination with blood and gore and thinking that makes him a great writer and director. If you like gore, then this is the movie for you. If you want a good story line you might as well pass.

87,itamarscomix,Messy and indecisive,7/10,23 September 2011,"Being a devoted Tarantino fan, for me this movie was a disappointment. Inglourious Basterds has its flashes of genius, as you'd expect from a Tarantino movie, but they're lost in a muddle of half-baked ideas and characters, and in the end it's probably his weakest movie so far, lacking in the one thing that even Death Proof had - energy and pace. The film does have some mentionable qualities, that are enough to make it watchable and even quite enjoyable - as you would expect from Tarantino, it's fantastically professional in every aspect, especially cinematography and sound. Some of the characters have tons of potential, and the actors are usually spot on (another honorable mention to Christoph Waltz), but there are so many characters that not one of them is developed enough to be satisfying. Tarantino fails to juggle a large number of plots and sub-plots the way he did in Jackie Brown in Pulp Fiction, and they never intertwine in any meaningful way. And worst of all, it's not even that controversial or offensive - Tarantino took a lot of liberties with history, and he certainly created violence that's more realistic and more explicit than ever before, but it's really just violence for the sake of itself. I realize I'm in a minority here, but I don't recommend this movie. I'm not saying don't watch it - there's a lot here to enjoy. But in the end, it's just not that good.",Inglourious Basterds,361748
88,gavin6942,Tarantino Has Finally Made His Masterpiece,9/10,6 September 2009,"In Nazi-occupied France, the Jews are being exterminated like rats. One escapes... only to later find herself mixed up with a German hero and Joseph Goebbels. At the same time, Lieutenant Aldo Rayne (Brad Pitt) leads a band of Jewish soldiers, not unlike the Dirty Dozen, who roam the European continent and slaughter, torture and disfigure Nazis at every stop. How do these two stories intertwine? Very well, if you ask me.This film seems to be very controversial, which comes as some surprise to me. On one hand, my friend Matt disliked it with a passion, saying it had too much of Tarantino's silliness imposed. On the other, certain people including myself have declared this Tarantino's masterpiece, outshining ""Pulp Fiction"" and being one of the best films of 2009, if not the best. Strong direction, and easily Tarantino's best writing, moving away from his pop culture references to more serious fare.The acting is wonderful, setting aside Brad Pitt and Eli Roth (who were great comic relief but not fantastic actors). I didn't even recognize Mike Myers, which is a good thing or I would have been appalled. The lead female Jew (Mélanie Laurent) and the Jew Hunter (Christoph Waltz) were perfectly balanced as strong characters. But the real strength of this film is in the writing, and subtle parallels between different segments of the film.The opening scene features Colonel Hans Landa the Jew Hunter comparing Nazis to hawks and Jews to rats. For me, this screamed of a comparison to Art Spiegelman's ""Maus"" where Nazis were cats and the Jews mice. And these connections ran through the length of the film, up until the David Bowie song ""Cat People"" played in the third act. While the song did not originally refer to Nazis (I assume), it now fits perfectly with the Spiegelman reference and the inclusion of the line about ""1000 years"", shortly after the movie has a toast to the 1000-year Reich.This all comes together in the theater scene, when the female lead is looking down from the projectionist booth at 350 Nazis she is about to kill. This is a reversal of the 350 killed from the ""bird's nest"" by her Nazi suitor, Private Fredrick Zoller (Daniel Brühl). So, the tables have turned, and the ""rat"" becomes the ""hawk"". Though, perhaps ironically, the one Nazi she doesn't kill is the very man who massacred her family: he lives to escape to America.There is another parallel between this film and GW Pabst's ""White Hell"". The film figures prominently on a billboard, but is also used by the British film historian to explain his accent. Later on, another character claims she broke her leg while mountain climbing. For those who haven't seen the Pabst film, this is the very plot: a mountain climber with a broken leg. Another friend and I have debated over whether Landa recognizes Shoshanna at their meeting in the French restaurant. He claims yes, as Landa orders her milk and then puts his cigarette out in his cream, a reference to her earlier life on a dairy farm. I feel this is meant to cause tension, but there is no reason to believe Landa would recognize a woman he has never seen face to face and goes by a new name.Tarantino is finally maturing as a director, moving away from his sophomoric days and pop culture fascination. Sure, he still has his moments -- the introduction of Sergeant Stiglitz (Til Schweiger), for example, or using Sam Jackson for a voice-over, or the Bear Jew -- but all in all this looks like a new direction that shows great promise and I expect Oscar nominations to be in the near future.",Inglourious Basterds,361748
89,lee_eisenberg,Quentin Tarantino's best movie yet,10/10,31 August 2009,"I have read criticisms of Quentin Tarantino's ""Inglourious Basterds"", saying that it glorifies violence or that it glosses over Nazi atrocities. Some people apparently don't realize that no part of the movie is meant to be taken seriously. This flick should not be interpreted as a historical film. It is basically a comedic spaghetti western set in WWII.Brad Pitt, playing a none-too-educated (but extremely clever) yokel leading a platoon of Jewish-American soldiers into Nazi-occupied France to kill and scalp Nazis, puts on one of the funniest performances that I've seen in years. And let me tell you, this movie leaves NOTHING to the imagination! As is the case with pretty much any Tarantino movie, this is one that squeamish people should avoid as if it was the H1N1 virus. For non-squeamish people, this is the flick for you! Tarantino is not afraid to show anything and play it for laughs. The scene in the cinema is, in my opinion, the movie's highlight: I would rank it right up there with Gene Kelly's stroll down the pluvial sidewalk in ""Singin' in the Rain"".Among the rest of the cast: Christoph Waltz as Nazi Col. Hans Landa, aka the Jew Killer; Diane Kruger as German actress Bridget von Hammersmark, collaborating with the Allies; Til Schweiger as a German-born Jewish soldier with the Americans; Mike Myers as an English officer; and Melanie Laurent as the daughter of a Jewish family, now seeking revenge.All in all, I recommend this movie as much as possible.",Inglourious Basterds,361748
90,produpp,"Brave, unique and just sheer brilliant!",10/10,2 June 2009,"Inglorious Basterds makes no apologies, asks for no forgiveness, it's a  no holds barred assault on the senses. Tarantino doesn't care if he  offends, if he steps all over stereotypes and clichés, this is film  making at it purest. It's great to see a film maker whose work clearly  isn't interfeared with by the powers that be. Tarantino is a master of  effortlessly cranking up immense tension and suddenly mixing it with  laugh out loud moments; you're not sure if you should be looking away  in disgust or rolling around laughing, either way it's a roller coaster  and one not to be missed! It's not for everyone, certainly if you're not a fan of Tarantino's style, this may be a little hard to swallow, but  never-the-less, it is a film which simply has to be seen. No self  respecting film fan should miss this. And the performance of Christoph  Waltz... Oscar don't you dare ignore him!!
