0,Ed-Shullivan,A simple story with a cast of animal characters that come to life and warm our hearts,8/10,3 February 2017,"This date night was going to be an unexpected twofer. First on our list we saw La La Land and just loved it so we stuck to the musical genre and next on our list was the lighter side of comedy with the animation feature Sing. Neither Mrs. Shullivan or I are fans of 3-D films but this was the only format being offered at 10:00 PM so we went for it. It took me about 15 minutes to adjust to the 3D format even though I have tried it a few times before, and my opinion has not changed. In my opinion the 3D format does not add any value to a film and by the sparse theater crowd I assume most are in agreement with me. Producers have attempted the 3D format for more than 60 years now with little success and I will be glad when the format is abandoned and the editors rely on content quality and not CGI.The film Sing is great and it will appeal to a vast crowd from the age of 3 to 103. After I had adjusted to the 3D format and we got to know the animal characters and the story line I for one just forgot that it was an animated feature and I sat back and watched the film progress in a very positive light. There are some big name stars lending their voices and I am sure they are proud of their finished product. Buster Moon (Matthew McConaughey) owns a theater for live performances that lately he has been unable to sustain paying his debts so the bank is after him to pay up or the bank will repossess Buster's dream theater. Buster's late father had worked extremely hard in his car wash across the street from the theater to fulfill Buster's dream to open the theater and Buster needed to pull off the biggest hit of his life if he were to keep his dream theater out of the bankers grasp. Each of the animal characters has a story to tell. Each of the animal characters also has a great voice and a personal life that the winning prize money if they were to win the sing off would take care of. The plot is simple so the children should be able to follow along relatively easy, all the animated animal characters were adorable. There are also some bad guys besides the bankers who want their hands on the prize money, and this just adds more humor and excitement to this cute little animated feature.The songs were great, the story line very heartwarming, and the animated characters were all cute and cuddly. Mrs. Shullivan and I ended our date night on a high note for this twofer evening. I give the film an 8 out of 10 rating, taking two points off for making me watch the film in 3D which did nothing to enhance this viewers experience. If you like this review I also wrote one on the first film we saw tonight which was La La Land.",Sing,3470600
1,view_and_review,Illumination Scores With Sing,8/10,11 December 2021,"Illumination Entertainment jumped into the animation game in 2010 with ""Despicable Me"" to challenge DreamWorks and Pixar and they made a big splash. They released some rather flat movies after that, but they'd already established that they could make a hit. ""Sing"" is proof that they only needed the right story with the right characters and they could be back in the conversation without a ""Despicable Me"" derivative.In ""Sing"" a koala named Buster Moon (Matthew McConaughey) was a struggling theater producer. He was trying to keep his dream afloat of running a successful theater, but he kept producing terrible acts. Then, with his back against the wall and his theater in danger, a brilliant idea coupled with a typo gave him the talent needed to make a hit.""Sing"" was comical, upbeat, and had great music. With actors like Reese Witherspoon, Seth MacFarlane, Scarlett Johansson, John C. Reilly, and others lending their voices, the names were certainly there. But it would be the singing voices that stole the show. It's something about the right musical numbers that makes everything come alive.",Sing,3470600
2,rdoubleoc,Great movie.,9/10,27 February 2019,"I've seen quite a few animated movies, but this one was very theatrical and memorable. Great choice of cast for voices, great story, and great animation. Not just a kids movie -- a lot of adults will like this as well.

3,Hellmant,"I'm not a big fan of most animated kids' films, these days, but this is one of the better ones.",8/10,4 January 2017,"'SING': Four Stars (Out of Five)The new hit computer-animated comedy musical; about a bunch of anthropomorphic animals that enter a singing competition, hosted by a koala bear that's trying to save his theater. It was written and directed by Garth Jennings (who also helmed 2007's 'SON OF RAMBOW', and 2005's 'THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY'), and it was co- directed by Christophe Lourdelet (a veteran animator, and first time filmmaker). It stars the voice talents of Matthew McConaughey, Reese Witherspoon, Seth MacFarlane, Scarlet Johansson, Taron Egerton, Tori Kelly, John C. Reilly, Nick Kroll, Jennifer Saunders and Jennings himself. The movie received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it's a blockbuster at the Box Office. I enjoyed it quite a bit.The story is set in a world inhabited entirely by humanoid animals. Buster Moon (McConaughey) is a hard working koala; who owns a classic theater, which hasn't been doing well financially (in quite some time). Buster is extremely optimistic that he can save it though, if he puts on a singing contest. When the $1,000 prize money is accidentally advertised as $100,000, many animals are eager to audition. Buster is determined to press on, despite not having the reward money that's promised. Multiple talented misfits ambitiously pursue their dreams, by participating in the competition. I'm not a big fan of most animated kids' films, these days, but this is one of the better ones. It's entertaining, beautiful to look at, and it's pretty emotional, at times, and inspiring as well. The music is all catchy, and fun to listen to, and the voice cast all does a good job. The film is funny, without being too overly silly too. I really enjoyed it, and I think most kids will as well.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/xGBv2IpDjDc",Sing,3470600
4,klchu,Great songs and great characters,9/10,26 November 2016,"I knew I was in for a good music movie when the first song gave me chills.I went into this movie expecting lots of songs and gags, and they are there, but I didn't expect to start caring about the characters and their stories. SING brings together a talented cast and writers for a movie that transcends some of the animated movies out there. The whole family loved it so feel free to bring anyone from 5 on up. Even the younger ones may enjoy it when it's available at home.Every voice actor delivers and the animators nailed it. The pacing and directing are also very well done. In fact, I could have done with even more of the ""auditions"" at the beginning.

5,tavm,Sing is the most enjoyable of the musical computer-animated movies we've seen this year!,9/10,21 December 2016,"This is the third computer-animated movie in a row that features actual singing by the characters after Trolls and Moana. The title basically means just about every character is singing something because it's about a singing contest being produced because the producer wants something that brings the people to his theatre, not like those previous shows that didn't do much for his career. Seems like all genres of music from various decades is represented here. My movie theatre-working friend was especially enamored with the gorilla singing a song associated with his favorite singer, Elton John. This movie does show the struggles of putting on a show and possible disasters that happen when risks are taken. I really don't want to reveal any more so I'll just say that me and my friend highly recommend Sing.

6,Floated2,"Interesting characters, great concept",8/10,27 July 2019,"There have seemingly been a wave a very solid animation movies within the last few years or so. Sing is quite a different animation film since the basic is about singing. Initially did not expect this film to be great, funny or interesting but upon viewing, there was something different in both style and originality with this film.What makes this film work is not only the singing (there are a blend of older songs and newer ones of different genres) but the different type of characters, and how each main animal character is given a backstory and subplot.For a family/children film it works- the comedy is juvenile, the visuals are nice to look at and it sends a positive message. Exceeded expectations, anticipating Sing 2.

7,aminifatimaaa,lighthearted and inspiring,8/10,20 May 2019,"An immensely enjoyable & likeable animated comedy, Garth Jennings' Sing is extremely entertaining to children and adults. The film may not, however, leave a lasting impression as the tale of a singing competition and its animal competitors does little to stand out. Characters are cute, and voice-talent is strong; but both the narrative and the animation lack depth. Sing is fun, but it rarely hits any high notes.

8,kevin_robbins,This is a unique and very well done movie. A modern day masterpiece.,10/10,17 February 2022,"Sing (2016) is a movie we went to see in theatres as a family. The storyline follows a struggling theatre that is looking for a way to not go out of business. The owner decides to have a singing competition that receives more auditions, participation and attention than he ever imagined. As it gets closer and closer to show night several participants will have to overcome their inner demons if they hope to deliver the performance of their life.This movie is codirected by Garth Jennings (Son of Rambow) and Christophe Lourdelet in his directorial debut. The voices are provided by Matthew McConaughey (Mud), Reese Witherspoon (Legally Blond), Scarlett Johansson (Black Widow), Seth MacFarlane (Family Guy), John C. Reilly (Step Brothers) and Jennifer Hudson (Dream Girls).The animation in this picture is excellent and very well done. The characters are brilliantly written and pull at your heart strings the entire movie. The storyline builds up perfectly keeping the audience glued to their seats and unable to be able to wait to see how it ends. The voices are perfectly selected as are the song choices. The ending doesn't disappoint and gives the audience everything it is looking for.This is a unique and very well done movie. A modern day masterpiece. I would score this a 10/10 and strongly recommend it.",Sing,3470600
9,donaldricco,"Sing, sing, sing sing!",8/10,23 April 2017,"I really enjoyed this film! Great songs with extraordinary voices! And cute characters too, especially the porcupine! Though I will admit, the car wash scene was a little awkward... though my 9 year old daughter thought it was funny! And her favorite part is the pig singing in the super market to the Gypsy Kings! Fun movie - great singing!

10,vasanisalim,Excellent movie. Clean entertainment for kids.,10/10,19 December 2016,"We saw Sing at a free preview organized by the makers and AMC. I really enjoyed watching the movie with my kids. I appreciate the fact that the makers did not resort to toilet humor to generate laughs. The entertainment was clean. There were no unnecessary sexual references.I like kids movies that inspire and Sing managed to do that. It encouraged kids to get over their fears and try against all odds. All the characters were lovable and unique in their personalities. Movie also had some very good music. Length of the movie was just fine for kids. My kids sat through the whole movie and did not get bored or restless till the end. Everybody in the theater seemed to have a good time. Nice feel good movie to watch with the kids. Go for it.

11,TheLittleSongbird,"Doesn't completely sing, but really soars when it does",7/10,21 July 2017,"Took me a while to come round to watching 'Sing'. It looked very interesting, and animation and musicals are things there is a real personal fondness for. Why did it take so long to watch it? Being behind with my film watching and hearing very divisive opinions on how good it was or not.Seeing 'Sing' for myself finally with an open mind, from personal opinion it was an enjoyable film with many good elements but has a few things that stop it from being even better. It really does soar fantastically when it does work, which it does a vast majority of the time, but doesn't completely sing with a few things that weren't given quite enough attention. While opinions seem mostly mixed to positive, it is easy to see why people will find fault with it. As far as 2016 animated films go, it's a good one and one of the better ones but there are far superior ones overall.Let's start with the positives, which are a great many. The animation is wonderful, it's bright, colourful, rich in detail and with slick character designs and some parts in the musical numbers have some imagination. Absolutely loved the soundtrack, which was incredibly varied which was great (from the Beatles and Katy Perry to Puccini and Stevie Wonder, amongst many others) and they are not just great songs on their own but the renditions of them have so much passion and heart (even remarkably fresh takes on songs that are done to death in talent shows).Most of the writing is good with something for both kids (younger and a little bit older) and adults. Parts are very funny and others very heartfelt. Likewise with the story, simple and standard stuff but it entertains and it moves with very emotional and beautifully written back-stories for particularly Johnny and Meena. The portrayal of talent shows and the backstage drama, while not much new at all, is affectionate and with much heart instead of being cynical or exploitative. Its message is universal and is as easy to relate to as the best of 'Sing's' characters. Enjoyed most of the characters, Johnny and Meena are instantly easy to relate to and the portrayal of the underdog with a heart of gold will also appeal greatly. The chemistry between them all is great. The voice acting is terrific, especially slick Matthew McConaughey, emotive Taron Egerton (really surprised me he did) and Tori Kelly and sassy Reese Witherspoon. John C Reilly is funny too.However, as has been acknowledged, 'Sing' is pretty predictable in places and would have benefited from having less characters and richer depth to more of the back-stories, all interesting but some rushed and not explored enough. Some of the characters were too thinly sketched, and some could have been left out entirely (a shame when most were written very well).For instance, count me in as somebody who found Mike an unpleasant and annoying character that will go over some children's heads and will make adults question about the message the character is meant to give out. Seth MacFarlane overdoes it in the voice acting too and considering the type of film needed to tone things down, this is a family film not the more adult-oriented 'Family Guy'.On the whole, while not perfect 'Sing' is enjoyable family fun. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Sing,3470600
12,lesleyharris30,"Simple Family Fun with a Stellar Soundtrack,",8/10,5 February 2017,"Sing is a great movie with a well developed plot and an outstanding voice cast. It is a simple, sweet film that the whole family can enjoy as we are taken in to a world of talking animals as they compete in a singing competition. There are countless fantastic covers performed by the animals throughout, a version of My Way by Frank Sinatra particularly stood out for me. There were far too many characters to follow, I think this could have been trimmed. There were obviously going to be ones that were more intriguing than the others and I feel like they should have limited it to the characters that really stood out. I found Meena to be a very boring character, I did not have much compassion for her, nor did she interest me in any way. The voice cast is outstanding in this movie. Matthew McConaughey shines as a polite koala, Reese Witherspoon is stellar in both speaking and singing parts as Rosita, Taron Egerton has great depth in Johnny, while Scarlett Johansson brings in a lot of energy as Ash. The highlight for me has to be Seth MacFarlane as Mike, this mouse suited his personality and the type of characters he is well use to playing in the likes of Family Guy perfectly. I found myself smiling whenever he came on screen, I loved his cocky, arrogant personality and his own song covers were terrific. It is a whole lot of fun that will leave you humming a variety of songs afterwards. While it is forgetful, Sing is a great ride and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good family film. In order to save his theatre, Buster Moon puts on a singing competition in which anyone in the city can compete.",Sing,3470600
13,nogodnomasters,All Creatures Great and Small,10/10,13 August 2017,"Following on the heels of ""Moana"" this is another must see film for the kids (and of course for you since you have to take them). Buster Moon is a play producer/director who has made flops. He means well, although his antics may approach that of Zero Mostel. He decides to have a talent contest for the best singer. We get to meet every character. The characters are cliché and the film formula, but it works due to the animation.We want them all to win as they are all underdogs. I was secretly pulling for the elephant. We have a shy singer, an unappreciated housewife and mother, a jilted woman, a con man, and a young person forced into a gang. None of the performers sing from just one artist. The film boasts 64 song credits, and while it has plenty of songs, it is not a musical. Fun uplifting film with some down moments. It was a film where the audience felt like applauding afterwards. A story about following your dream.",Sing,3470600
14,r96sk,Smart song choices,8/10,3 March 2020,"'Sing' isn't anything new, but I thoroughly enjoyed watching it.Excellent animation, fun characters, smart song choices along with a competent storyline. Matthew McConaughey is terrific, he brings a lot of life to Buster. Seth MacFarlane and Scarlett Johansson are fab, too.

15,classicsoncall,"""Real talent from real life - that's what audiences want!""",8/10,22 January 2017,"My eight year old granddaughter could hardly contain herself when I asked her if she wanted to see the movie. All through the picture she would poke me when something struck her as unusually cute or funny. We caught the 3-D version which was well done. I don't get to see that many so it's cool to see how the animators make their characters come off the page so to speak.I for one am pretty poor at recognizing the actors behind the voices in animated flicks like this and I wouldn't have guessed a single one here. With that in mind, I thought all the non-professional singers who lent their talent did a pretty good job. Seth MacFarlane was a hoot as Mike the Sinatra Mouse with a nice rendition of 'My Way', and I couldn't get over Scarlett Johansson rocking it out as her character Ash, or Reese Witherspoon as Rosita. They all sounded good with strong singing voices.What gets me as I read the negative reviews on this board for what's nominally a kid's picture is how nasty some of the comments are. One particularly deranged reviewer goes into specific detail on how each of the singing animals performing in Buster Moon's talent show represents a nominee of President Donald Trump's cabinet. That would be especially amazing foresight for writer and director Garth Jennings who started on the project early in 2014, with an almost completed film screened as a work in progress at the Toronto Film Festival back in September of 2016.Well, not to get sidetracked, but this film is generally fun entertainment for the entire family with an important message of perseverance for youngsters on working toward completing their goals. That one's best exemplified by Tori Kelly's Meena - ""Don't let fear stop you from doing the things you love.""",Sing,3470600

18,valadas,Beautiful,8/10,16 December 2016,"A movie whose characters are all animals but in anthropomorphic shape and with human feelings and reactions. Their number is extremely varied: koalas (the chief character is one), elephants, gorillas, dogs, giraffes, etc. and even squids. Their facial expressions are extremely human. And the urban atmosphere is totally human: the buildings, the streets, the cars and the traffic. The story is rather interesting. The main character, a human koala, organizes a singing competition to try to restore the old prestige of his beautiful theater. This meets with several problems including a flood that destroys the theater building meanwhile. But having the friendship and help of his public he ends up having his theater rebuilt and gives a nice concert in it.",Sing,3470600

I was even stoked to have realized Seth McFarlane was on this and omg, his voice just melts you, it is just so sexy! The frank Sinatra look on his mouse character, really suits his part! You don't get to see enough of McFarlane singing in animation especially when he's on Family Guy! I don't have a particular favourite singing animal on this but all were very good.

The depth of the character development for animated people/animal things. The number of characters was complex but complimentary. The thorough plot and plot twists. And then the music, singing. Super heavyweight Jen Hudson, pros like Reese Witherspoon, Tori, Jennifer Saunders, John Reilly. The singing built up throughout. And shocker to me Scarlett Johansonn was awesome. Its got fart jokes, jiggly pig bellies, sad family tales and a really super ending.Pay your dues, have no expectations, sit and enjoy. Sing my arse, they Jennifer Hudson'ed this flick. Awesome !!

21,Amthermandes,"Like ""Zootopia,"" with singing.",7/10,15 January 2021,"It's a cute film, despite the overbearing typical modern themes of ""you're special,"" ""you can do anything you set your mind to"", and ""follow your heart"". Plot development and execution is extremely predictable and ""cookie-cutter"", but the good stuff is all in the details: the humor, the characters, the animation, and sure, even the music.One may think the movie is purely a platform upon which to showcase all the current, popular musical artists, with almost no thought or heart going into everything else, but thankfully this is not the case. It's not perfect, and yes, there is heavy ""music placement"", but it should be obvious even to the most skeptic of critics that a lot of work went into creating a fun, family-friendly movie for all.The actors & singers do a great job too, and on a personal note, it's a great way for anyone unfamiliar with Seth MacFarlane's singing abilities to see just how friggin' talented the guy is, despite their opinion of him.",Sing,3470600

It was nuanced, emotional, multilayered, with a strong beginning, middle and end.I loved every minute of this movie and I can find no fault, it's a 10 outta 10 from me.

23,mrsjond,Brilliant,10/10,4 December 2016,"I have just seen Sing with Hubby and two 7 year old's we all thought it was absolutely brilliant. It is rare for us all agree we all enjoyed a film. In fact this is the only one this year.The music was first class lots of heads rocking to the beat, it had a good variety of music and I am even considering getting the soundtrack.Rosita Pig was my favourite character and I thought Reece Witherspoon had an amazing voice though really all of them were good singers.If you are looking to start the New Year off (as due for release in January 2017) I cannot recommend going to see this film enough as ""fun for all the family"".

24,grandmastersik,Sing the praises,9/10,9 January 2017,"Let me start off by saying that I HATE all those singing competitions on TV... so my initial thoughts were, ""Why on earth would I want to sit through an animated X Factor?""Luckily, my little girl wanted to see it, and reluctantly I took her, making note of the Just Dance-inspired soundtrack and Blake Snyder style storytelling-by-numbers. Suddenly though, despite all the clichés, typical Hollywood plot beats and predictability, I found that I actually cared what was happening. No, it was more than that, I was completely engrossed - and I don't even know how or when it happened.Sing is a unique and bizarre film: it's the perfect example of stars aligning to turn even the most sceptical viewer into a sniffing, pumped-up fan of song, dance and being just alive. It's the kind of film that says, ""Wow, there really is still magic in Hollywood.""I've never been a fan of Elton John and my knowledge of Taylor Swift began at ended at her being a pop singer, but each song fitted perfectly and to see my little girl stamp her feet and clap was worth the admission price alone! Sing is the ultimate feel good film; we left on a high and it lasted for days afterwards.In this age of Netflix, where the concept of owning DVDs is quickly becoming obsolete, here is a film well worth the purchase when it becomes available. Fantastic.",Sing,3470600
25,Anurag-Shetty,A good animated film with great singing performances.,7/10,3 January 2017,"Sing tells the story of a koala named, Buster Moon(Matthew McConaughey). To save his theater from shutting down, Buster has a singing competition involving some very talented animals. Sing is a fun film. The animation is superb. The 3D is impressive. All the actors sing really well. The only flaw in the movie is, there is not too much humor in it. There are barely any laugh-out-loud scenes in the film. A note on the voice-over work. Matthew McConaughey is brilliant as Buster Moon. Reese Witherspoon is awesome as Rosita. Seth MacFarlane is excellent as Mike. Scarlett Johansson is spectacular as Ash. John C. Reilly is great as Eddie. Taron Egerton is outstanding as Johnny. Tori Kelly is amazing as Meena. The supporting cast is good. Sing is not a must watch. However, it is worth a watch with your family.

27,mrkgkaye,Definitely A Must See,10/10,3 January 2017,"I read some other reviews before posting my own, especially the ones that are rated less than 5 stars. I just have to say that Sing is a good movie that does not tie into any racial stereotypes nor does it enforce any kind of agenda. So those that believe that there are some sort of hidden message to Sing, is dead wrong.The plot is a bit interesting only because without the singing competition there is no way to connect the characters. But that is the thing, each character that is represented is going through something different that wants them to be there. It is exactly like Buster Moon says ""Do not Let Fear Stop You from Doing the Thing You Love Most""I found myself connecting to each of the characters emotionally, because i know that we have all been there at some point in our lives. The Adult Themes are much needed in Sing, because without them it would have just been another cheesy, second rate, kids film with no depth.You got:a tired, overworked, and under-appreciated pig mom, with 12 piglet children, who gave up on her dreams, while her husband is completely oblivious to her. A moody porcupine teenager who was selected over her boyfriend which she finds out later that is a complete jerk when he was ""cheating."" OK so the definition of cheating is weak, but he is caught singing with another girl in her apartment. The ""swift and conniving"" mouse guy who is only in it for the money, trying to hustle mobsters, but fails. All while living on his own standards.An Elephant teenager who is just too scared and shy to get over her insecurities to sing in front of others, especially when she has the family supporting her. Oh and the grandfather that helps her get the courage to do so, because of his ""birthday wish"" to see her sing and excel in life.And, my favorite, a gorilla teen who does not want to be like his father and not a part of his notorious gang who pull off a gold heist.",Sing,3470600
28,planktonrules,"A simple movie....made really, really well.",9/10,1 July 2022,"I had no interest in seeing ""Sing"" but my oldest daughter insisted I should watch it. I am very glad I listened to her, as I really enjoyed the film.The story is very simple...a conniving producer, Buster Moon (Matthew McConaughey), is in desperate trouble...he's nearly broke and his dream of being a beloved Broadway style producer are a bust. In desperation, he concocts a scheme...to hold a singing contest. But instead of paying the winner $1000, there's a typo...and the finalists all expect the prize to be $100,000! There's more trouble as well...such as the bank wanting to foreclose on the theater! Additionally, each of the finalists have a backstory which add to the tension and give the story some depth.The plot is super-simple. So why did I give this CGI film from Sony/Universal a 9? Well, everything about the film worked perfectly...the voice actors, the writing and, especially, the truly amazing CGI. For 2016, it's every bit as good (if not better) than a Pixar or Disney release....with amazing shading, lighting and textures. Add to this one important thing....it's fun! Overall, a truly excellent film...one that had me wanting a sequel...something I RARELY want!",Sing,3470600
29,patriciogl10,Unexpectedly charming.,8/10,11 December 2019,"Sing features an memorable collection of songs performed by a talented cast that undoubtedly brings this movie to life. But Sing doesn't offer just that, it appeals as well through an engaging story that you will connect with because it was written to cause that on viewers, so cleverly I might add. There's a wide array of characters that aid to the changing dynamics that also help propel the story in a cohesive way.All the acts in the film are evenly proportioned, going seamlessly from one to the other, as if they were glued in a harmonious way. In that particular sense this film really grabbed me, it is consistently firm in quality from start to finish; that's how I perceived it, hence why I believe I enjoyed it so much. And of course the songs are excellent, which I consider them to be a wonderful accompaniment to a heart-warming story.I highly recommend this film, if you enjoy music or simply want a great animated film, go with Sing!",Sing,3470600
30,neil-476,Musical fun,8/10,15 May 2018,"Buster Moon, seeking to save his failing theatre, stages a talent contest. The competitors include dancing housewife Rosita, teenage delinquent Johnny, undervalued songwriter and ace guitarist Ash, cocky crooner Mike, shy songstress Meena etc. And each of these has personal and domestic issues to be resolved.A synopsis makes it clear that there is very little originality here as regards story. This sort of tale dates back to the 1930s, to early sound musicals with Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney. And even though the characters' assorted problems can be viewed as more modern - Johnny's Dad is a bank robber, Rosita's husband undervalues her, Mike is tied up with organised crime - they still won't come as a surprise to any adult who has watched films since childhood.But let's factor in that these characters are all anthropomorphised animals, and that this is a CGI movie with kids as its primary audience, and the familiarity of its plot becomes considerably less important.Since marvelling at Toy Story, and then Shrek, there have been so many CGI features that one can more or less take it as read that character and product design, animation and voicework will all be first rate, and that is the case here - one expects accomplishment, and a film which falls short in these areas is far more noteworthy than one which doesn't. So we can take it as read that Sing - largely put together by the French Despicable Me production company - is as visually striking as we would expect it to be.Where it succeeds is in the musical numbers, both in how they are staged, and in how emotionally they are integrated into the narrative. I'm a sucker for music which grips me by the throat, either in its own right or by reference to how it is presented, and a lot of the music here does just that. I'm not going to give examples because, if this movie is your sort of thing, then I don't want to spoiler any of the delights in store for you.The music, from across the musical spectrum, is well-chosen and well-used, whether in its or original form or as rearranged. I had never realised that Golden Slumbers/Carry That Weight was so sad.So don't see it if you hate musicals, CGI, or movies with no surprises. But if you're OK with all that, you'll love it.",Sing,3470600
31,ayoreinf,"Well written roles, carry this movie beautifully",8/10,2 March 2019,"To be precise, most of these are well written cartoon roles, and still, though this cartoons are supposedly shallow we get the stellar cast finding in them hidden depth. They all seem to be mere cliche. The busy neglected stay at home mom; the silly infatuated teenager; the sensative son of a gangster; the slick con man that thinks the world of himself; the cantankerous ancient diva; and obviously the clumsy and shy fat girl with a golden voice. Each and every one here is a cliche, but a well written one, and they all get room for growth, and in this little heartwarming singalong, they do grow and they do warm our hearts while doing it.It's not easy writing cartoon characters and making them human enough for us to care for them instead of laughing from them, but Garth Jennings pulls it off. He gets his stellar cast performing one surprising real life singer after the other. The fact that the actors do sing their songs helps a lot, making each song their own.At the bottom line it's funny at the right moments and moving at the right moments, even though the story is never really original and never really surprising, it does make us care for every single character on screen, and in my personal book, it's quite an acievement",Sing,3470600
32,FelipeCarrillo,A Touching and Moving Animal American Idol,9/10,5 January 2017,"In 2007, Christopher ""Chris"" Meledandri, the founder and current CEO of Illumination Entertainment, founds his own animation film production company after having been President of 20th Century Fox Animation and supervised and produced movies such as ""Ice Age"", its sequel ""Ice Age: The Meltdown"", among others. Three years later, ""Despicable Me"" seeps in worldwide movie show-times as a joyful, energetic and mostly invigorating feature film. Since then, the company has been rising, collecting recognition and purification which are credited to its works. With discrepant spin-offs, sequels, and original ideas, they've been working on providing an annual film, and while 2011 didn't release any new project, they challenge themselves this year like the major studios with two films filled with magic, spirit, and exultation. After ""The Secret Life of Pets"" of Chris Renaud and Yarrow Cheney, arrives the seventh one and the first animated musical of the Universal Pictures section. The factory shows clearly conviction deposited in its product, since it has been a pretty competitive year in the matter, and even story lines of this film have been outlined in other projects, putting it at great risk around to the unpleasant and subjective paradigms. However, there are inexplicably films of which you cannot hate, even though you know that something goes wrong, well this is the case.In a universe where humans are substituted by animals, it's ordinary to glimpse a giraffe jogging, a lizard talking or a zebra cooking. In this domesticated world is set Buster Moon (Matthew McConaughey), a koala owner of a fluctuating theater which is falling apart due to the almost non-existent income. He hopes to become a virtuoso host and rebuilds the theater, which his father bequeathed him; so announces a singing competition without restrictions or impediments, anyone who considers that can hum has the possibility of auditing in the proscenium. After a grueling knockout round, there are five shortlisted contenders to fight for the tempting award, a prize that has been altered by mistake. The finalists are intended to be a heterogeneous group: Rita (Reese Witherspoon), a housewife and mother of 25 piglets should be related a lover pop culture pig, Gunter (Nick Kroll); an egotistical and individualistic small mouse, Mike (Seth Macfarlane); a teenage elephant with stage panic, Meena (Tori Kelly); a young bouncer who wants categorically a different tomorrow from his family gives him, Johnny (Taron Egerton) and a rocker porcupine with an amorous deception, which impels her to emerge as a soloist; Ash (Scarlett Johansson). Around these plots, the story succumbs in well-known territories, however, it comes out unscathed thanks to the thoughtful and authentic connection with their characters; a story that finds its main propellant in the wonderful inspiration.In times where scrupulousness for accuracy and concentration for detail ruled in ""Zootopia"" or ""Kubo and the Two Strings"", many people consider that the film does not take hold in visual terms regarding its predecessors, placing emphasis repeatedly in the facial gestures scarcity and poor worked textures, however, contrary to what many declares, I encounter this one even more effective since they put the organic aside for going deeper in significant features for development, it should be noted that the above does not mean that the movie perishes visually, it's gorgeous on the essentials; the squids liveliness, the flood, the city environment and the auditions are grandiose but evidently dissimilar against its competitors. It's noteworthy that Illumination has joined the trend of concealing different easter eggs among its films in order to generate a kind of not confirmed interconnection among them, clearly highlighting the masks used by gorillas in the robberies, the iconic and unforgettable face of Snowball played by Kevin Hart in ""The Secret Life of Pets"".Music is a vital issue, therefore they inject covers of 65 different artists, which ranging from Ariana Grande's low notes to the exquisite polyphony of Frank Sinatra. Katy Perry, Kanye West, Sam Smith, The Beatles, Beyonce, Lady Gaga and Nicki Minaj lead the melodic lists artfully personified, linked and adorned by particularly humorous circumstances. In addition to this, the film also conceived two own songs: ""Faith"", performed by Stevie Wonder and Ariana Grande and ""Set it All Free"" sung by incredible Johansson.The last card of the ascending study is an uplifting, noticeably touching and fertile in laughs reality show that will return you the hope of finding simple films with teachings so important. With animation standards of the seventh art in these days, ""Sing"" may not be an aesthetic pearl, but who longs for sensational animals and computerized voices when you have Taron Egerton singing to the dreams, to Scarlett Johansson as a mother and model or to Mathew McConaughey keeping alive the illusion of dreaming and fighting; any human being would swap one thing for other.",Sing,3470600
33,StevePulaski,Illumination finally gives their formula the life and respect necessary for it to succeed,7/10,26 November 2016,"After wading in the water in terms of quality for the better half of this year, Illumination Entertainment finally gets the above-average film they deserve with Sing. The sad part about a film like this - which is basically an animated variety show of animals covering yesterday and today's pop tunes - is it's more likely to fail than succeed on the simple merit that its narrative prompts for things like humor based on recognition, general unevenness, and lazy screen writing. While all of those certainly come into play sooner or later, you might just be surprised, as I was, how Sing's effervescent charm sneaks up on you well into its second act and manifests its way into becoming an enjoyable, character-centered experience.The film revolves around the perky Buster Moon (voiced by Matthew McConaughey), a Koala bear who owns the historic Moon Theatre and has for the past twenty-five years. In the present day, however, the theater is dilapidated, with crippled, worn infrastructure that can barely stay intact. Buster hasn't put on a show in three years, but with the help of his elderly, but well-meaning lizard assistant Ms. Crawly (director Garth Jennings), they decide to host a singing competition which will eventually pave the way for a variety show of sorts for the entire neighborhood.Originally intending the winner of the competition to get $1,000, a typo by Ms. Crawly renders the cash prize $100,000, money that Buster doesn't have but must fake like he does until the show is over. This becomes harder to do when he sees exactly how troubled most of his talent are, and how they're all singing to escape or better themselves. There's a teenage gorilla named Johnny (Taron Egerton), who is trying to forge a path for himself unlike his father's that doesn't involve petty crime and gang activity, a mouse named Mike (Seth MacFarlane), who is in total debt with no immediate relief, a young elephant named Meena (Tori Kelly), who needs to overcome stage-fright in order to pursue his dreams as a singer, a porcupine named Ash (Scarlett Johansson), who gets accepted while the other half of her duo/boyfriend Lance (Beck Bennett) does not, and a pig named Rosita (Reese Witherspoon), who is caught in the middle of a struggling marriage with her husband and twenty-five piglets as she tries to relive her years as a performer.A movie where animals sing once-popular radio hits feels like the ""cat video""-infested bowels of Youtube taken to the next level, so on that note, much like their film The Secret Life of Pets, Illumination has cracked the secret to getting people interested in their films on a purely conceptual (no matter how basic) level. But after insulting us with Minions and shortchanging us with Pets, the studio finally gets it right with Sing by giving us what we subconsciously expected to see, which was a bit of a story behind the characters. We'll come for the cuteness, but we'd also like to be given a reason to stay and a reason to connect to the film.Sing features an amiable cast of characters with familiar voices - McConaughey and MacFarlane are very good, for that matter - and infuses their stories with enough interest to make them transcend the tropes they could've fallen into it quite easily. For example, the stories of Meena, Rosita, and Ash are actually kind of sad, and give way to the wonderful idea of female empowerment based on breaking out of ""your place"" or your comfort zone and fully becoming your own, confident person. Common, absolutely, but screenwriter Jennings infuses a bit of disillusionment into their stories to give them an emotional layer that might even echo or resonate with parents, who thought they were taking their kids to see another cute and cuddly kid movie. Maybe they might even see something in the way the Johnny character feels, as he's constantly pressured by his father to be tough and to be a part of his gang rather than encouraging him to be his own person.Sing has moments where its lazy screen writing does prevail, such as the handful of montages we get that show a goofy pig dancing to Lady Gaga's ""Bad Romance"" or kangaroos singing the Men Without Hats' ""Safety Dance."" They're moments of brief amusement until you realize how entirely vapid and distracting they really are. Thankfully, where Jennings could've stopped writing, he decided to keep going, and the result is a modestly successful animated film that at least makes an admirable attempt to give us more than the internet and other movies of the like already have.Voiced by: Matthew McConaughey, Reese Witherspoon, Seth MacFarlane, Taron Egerton, Scarlett Johansson, Tori Kelly, Beck Bennett, and Garth Jennings. Directed by: Garth Jennings.",Sing,3470600

I still cannot get over the vocals of all of the actors, they were incredible. Jennifer Hudson's rendition of Golden Slumbers is soul lifting. We just saw t after the Christmas rush in 3D, and that was the best way to really appreciate it.

The movie was a feel good movie and it had things for both Kids and the Adults to enjoy. Me and the audience laughed throughout and enjoyed the film, we even clapped when the end credits rolled.

37,MayuMG,"It looked great, then I had doubts, and then I enjoyed it thoroughly!",9/10,6 January 2017,"Honestly, the first trailer I saw caught my interest immediately. It also seemed to have Johnny, the gorilla, as the main character, so you can imagine my surprise and dis-ease when the new trailers hardly showed him at all. It made me feel like ""Oh no... if they're this unsure of their plot, what will the movie be like?"" But I held onto my first impression and went into the theater with excitement, and I was not disappointed in the least.The focus was mostly taken by Mr. Moon, but the movie did this very interesting thing where all the characters are given just enough screen time to flesh them out, encouraging the audience to find patterns and realize the overarching moral. It strangely made the moral much easier to feel and realize. No main character felt unnecessary, and it made all of them easier to love (I love every single one of the characters, actually). I think I liked it better this way than how it would've ended up with one main character. It gets the message across much better than it would've before. By seeing everyone's own stories and problems and determination to pursue their dreams, it provides a larger umbrella for all audiences, that no matter what you've been through, you can still keep going. Basically, the movie focused more on the message than the story. I really appreciated that, and I'm sure the kids do too.I also like this thing that's been happening in movies lately: a theme of wanting the past to be popular in the present. And the fact that Mr. Moon isn't the usual stubborn traditionalist is refreshing and makes him a LOT more likable and unique. La La Land had it's stubborn traditionalist through the Jazz fanatic Sebastion, but he obviously learns to be a bit more open-minded by the end. That was good, but Mr. Moon being open-minded from the start is much more likable and makes him a sturdy pillar amongst the messy lives of the singers who search for solutions throughout the film. So basically, whenever I saw the guy, I felt like everything was gonna be okay. Mr. Moon didn't care as long as he kept running his beloved theater, and I think that's a type of conviction that's rarely found today. I would say Mr. Moon is my favorite character, but I can't because all the other singers are just as likable in how they overcome their problems.But I will admit I didn't like how it encouraged what good singing is. It creates a connection with the kids of today, but it also teaches them that what we're listening to now IS good singing and kind of encourages kids to stay in that spectrum of pop music.I gotta appreciate Mike the mouse's singing, though. Knowing Seth MacFarlene was gonna voice him instantly made me feel excited about the music they would be singing. Gotta love Seth. :DSo basically, just go see it. As an adult, it was very enjoyable. As a musician, I appreciated their efforts quite a bit.Also, Mr. Moon's name reminded me of Georges Méliès in Hugo. If that was intentional (which I feel like must be), I love it. :D.",Sing,3470600

39,Rob-O-Cop,"Dubious, vapid, trite, shallow, with nothing really to say at all",4/10,5 March 2017,"Trailing miles behind Pixar/Disney in the story department Illumination doesn't seem to be able to deliver anything worthwhile to audiences in terms of insight, laughs and meaning. They're still stuck in another decade as far as quality animation with depth is concerned, and this movie is not only no exception it pushes the bar even lower for them.There's nothing wrong with the look and sound of their productions but the content is shockingly vapid, and even worse sends out dubious messages to it's young an impressionable audiences.In this movie we have a gorilla family involved in organised crime portrayed as normal. They of course are voiced with non American accents cos crime is foreign, right? Then there's the mean-natured mouse who cheats the Russian bears at gambling and ends up with the tarty mouse and no repercussions for his mean-natured behaviour through out the whole movie.The Koala steals electricity and water and cons his way to keep his theatre alive, but this is just charming behaviour of course.The film is full of cliché character portrayals and vacuous 'role models' wrapped in the myth of singing stardom c/o the American idol myth.There is nothing of real value for children here, let alone any real depth for the average adult. The only thing going on here is a dark cynical racist pastiche of the ugliness of the entertainment industry played like it was a positive thing. Gee, thanks for your contribution to society.",Sing,3470600
40,matthewssilverhammer,"It's Bad, But At Least There Are No Minions In Sight",3/10,30 December 2016,"2016 has been a porcupine quill in the eye, so it feels appropriate that Sing, a decided disappointment, is the last movie I review this year. Illumination (Minions, Despicable Me) might be the most mediocre studio around; each of their movies have such potential, yet refuse to reach past clichéd stories, characters, and humor. Sing is no different, leaning on montages to fix problems, stilted familiarity to force emotion, and a long-expired message about kids being themselves. Gimme a break. It starts great, introducing us to each of the singing-animal characters with a flying shot, letting us know how they're music affects and is affected by the life around them. Unfortunately from there, each high note the movie hits is undercut by a sour one. The lack of one clear protagonist gives it some stakes, but they do little with them except to bombard us with ""The Voice"" style sob stories. The song performances definitely have their moments, but they also have their annoyances (Crazy Town's ""Butterfly""; rabbits singing ""Anaconda""; yet ANOTHER cover of ""Hallelujah""). The one decent character, a soulful gorilla named Johnny, is even ruined by a dangerously cynical parenting storyline. Worst of all, the humor fails. In my theater, the only joke that garnered real guffaws was a shoddy gag about nervous farting. The characters being animals serves no purpose but to cheaply engage children, unlike the far superior Zootopia from earlier this year, which used its non-human characters to great comedic and thematic effect. I guess if you found the trailers for Sing hilarious, emotionally fulfilling and coherently plotted, then you may enjoy this. Otherwise, don't buy a ticket for this show.",Sing,3470600
41,Giacomo_De_Bello,5/10,5/10,15 December 2016,"Theater producer Buster Moon (Matthew McConaghuey) owns the most glorious theater in town, but his many failures have brought the theater gradually into almost falling apart. When the bank gives an ultimatum to Moon has one last chance to reestablish the theater to its former glory and he decides to assemble the greatest singing competition ever put to stage.By reading that synopsis I don't think anyone would ever believe it needed to have animals as characters and that cuts right to the problems ""Sing"" has, even though it manages to sneak in some good laughs and funny characters, the final product ends up being a mess, overlong and stuffed with too much stuff for a single film.What is sad about this film is that it furthers a pre-conception about Illumination Entertainment and the more we go on the more that becomes evident: they are not making movies based on good stories, their interest is widely oriented towards flashy products that attract kids and they keep struggling with bringing those ideas on screen in a way that makes a film pleasant and watchable for all audiences. Their animation is also inferior to anything we've seen in the genre recently. So of course they are making tons of money and good for them, but the more we go on the more I frown when the logo of the company comes in before the film, it has never meant good news up until now and that's really sad.Garth Jennings worked on this project for five years and wrote and directed this alone, something very rare in the animation world, so he definitely deserves a huge amount of respect for diving into such an effort and, admittedly, he comes out with some good stuff: many of the characters in this film have a great starting point and an effortlessly comedic dynamic, Miss Crawly, voiced by Jennings himself, is the old lizard assistant to Moon and almost all of her jokes work, her dynamic on screen is just comedic gold. Seth MacFarlane also brings to life a hilarious, irreverent rat with a passion for jazz and that is another element of the film that really works.There is also a raw energy to the film that is established through the music that is passed on to the audience in a positive way for the major part, it gets you going along with the characters and brings out some very funny musical gags and jokes that are definitely the highlight of the film. There's also to consider the fact that the protagonist of the film is incredibly likable and even though his journey doesn't offer much emotionally, he remains a strong character with some very strong traits.Yet, nothing, not even he incredibly high spirited joyful atmosphere of the film can save some of the big flaws in the storytelling and the overall concept of the film. There are no two ways around it: you are watching a film with anthropomorphized animals and I couldn't, for the life of me, explain to myself why they were animals and why was this the medium through which I was watching the film, it is a fatal story flaw that annoyed the hell out of me, especially considering how big of a production this is.Another highly unbalanced element is how the music is handled in the story. Whilst it does manage to give the film a pleasant beat at times, for the majority of the film the way in which the characters interact with it is pathetic and this is coming from someone who has been a musician for all of his life. The message behind the music, the way showmanship is represented, the idea of the competition and worst of all the actual music choice, all of this is handled terribly, it sets a terrible example for kids and it really disrespects the musician figure. It does not manage to make the music relevant thematically or emotionally and that is yet another flaw in how the movie is structured and brought to life.Finally, there are many touches of style in the film that fail miserably. The way the characters are introduced by making the camera move fast around the city, is one of the laziest and most useless techniques I have ever has the displeasure to experience in a theater and I think that everyone involved in taking that decision should really think about it. It is terribly out of place and adds nothing to the story or the tone of the film. It is really something that I was shocked to see employed in an A+ Hollywood production and this is not the only useless and lazy stylish addition that the film employs.Overall sing has some good comedic touches, some likable characters and an overall energetic vibe to favor it, yet the film on a whole does not stand up as a pleasantly joyful experience because of several flaws from the inception of the idea to the character development.",Sing,3470600
42,ashleydesern,Sing,8/10,22 December 2016,"I went into this movie not expecting very much. I had recently seen Zootopia and Pets, both animated movies set in worlds full of solely animals, and had similar expectations. Sing, however, had much more of a plot than I had expected. The animals go through some real issues and struggles faced by people who own small businesses or businesses related to fine arts. This is a good movie to take the kids to as it is animated, full of songs, and family friendly in its humor. The outstanding cast full of big names in the must industry makes the movie more inviting to parents as well. Overall, this movie was worth the watch.

43,pinkarray,Second-hand embarrassment,3/10,25 December 2016,"And so this ends the tiring amount of movies all about animals this year.I went to the theater to see a movie for Christmas. I was torn between wanting to see Star Wars Rogue or Sing. But since I haven't seen much of the original Star Wars, I wasn't too sure about seeing it and decided against it to see Sing since I love songs.As a music fan, I was very disappointed. It was bland, it was clichéd, and the dramatic parts were forced, or is it just me ignoring the movie by looking at my phone because I don't give a crap and it was quite boring?Rosita's piglets and those radio animals don't contribute much to the story and were just there for almost pure annoyance. Taking the piglets out will not chance the story and maybe even the radio animals.It's like the writers weren't even trying to make these characters sympathetic. Few of the characters were jerks The plot is contrived and lazy. The jokes were funny and annoying at the same time especially that fart scene, I have had enough of fart scenes! They are NOT THAT funny!The character design was ugly and sick to watch.Now for the plus, well, the animation was dazzling and sparkling. Most of the voice actors did really well singing and voicing their characters and they should be proud. There was a little obnoxious singing in there but not that much. I think kids might like to sing along to some of the great songs in here, other songs that were covered I didn't like so much. Though, I don't understand why for God's sake, they put Anaconda in a kids movie! Even if it's just a little bit, ugh!-_- And what is with people and twerking these days?Though, this movie could've been better and I was disgusted at how many famous actors they put in this movie. Just because it's a movie about characters singing famous songs, you put famous actors in there? And Reese Witherspoon is one of my favorite actors and she should be spending her time voicing a better movie than this.There was a bit too many famous songs in there for me.I guess I'm not into these type of movies.",Sing,3470600
44,Animated_Antic,I really had a good time.,9/10,4 January 2017,"I seriously had started to doubt Illumination's movies after the disaster known as ""Minions"". I really had lost my appeal in their movies and ""Secret Life of Pets"" didn't help me win them back. Sing on the other hand, did. This movie is very well crafted, fun, funny and overall a good movie.The story is about a koala who owns a theater named Buster Moon (Mathew McConaughey). He's struggling to keep his theater open and pay the bills so he figures, if he holds a singing competition, he can bring back the crowds. He plans to give out a $1,000 prize to the winner, but an error makes it seem that the prize is $100,000. The competition quickly spreads around town and Moon selects the best singers. An overworked mother pig named Rosita (Reese Witherspoon) who is partnered with a crazier pig named Gunter (Nick Kroll), a teenage porcupine rock star named Ash (Scarlett Johansen) who is trying to get over a breakup, a gorilla named Johnny (Taron Egerton) who does not want to be part of his fathers gang, a shy and stage fright elephant named Meena (Tori Kelly), and an arrogant mouse (Seth MacFarlane).One of things that I really enjoyed about this movie were all the characters. They're all very likable and the actors who play them have really good singing voices and film doesn't even use auto-tune at all (unlike Trolls). Another thing that I did enjoy was the animation which is really good and is mostly laid back unlike Illumination's previous movies. The story is also really well written, for the most part. There are some jokes in the movie that aren't really funny, but they're very rare and I also thought the story kind of went back and forth as it seems some certain scenes weren't tied together well. And, yeah, let's talk about the similarities that this movie has to ""Zootopia"". The film really didn't need to be composed of anthropomorphic animals. In fact, if you made them humans I think only one line would change and that's it. The city they live in also seem unnatural for the animals. In ""Zootopia"", the city looks like a city animals built and would live in, Sing's city looks more like a Southern California city, but if you ask me those are nitpicks.All in all, Sing is a very good movie and I definitely had a fun time. I definitely enjoyed this movie and certainly recommend it. It's not a great movie, but I don't think it's supposed to be. I think it was only supposed to be a nice simple animated film and I definitely plan on watching it again.",Sing,3470600
45,rgkarim,"Sing it Loud, Cute and Proud",7/10,21 December 2016,"Tis the season for movies, and this week there are plenty of films for all to see. My first review this week is the latest animation film geared toward the younger audience group. Assuming you've seen the title of my review, you know I'm talking about Sing, Illumination Studios' latest production. As an answer to Disney's Zootopia, Sing is trying to take the anthropomorphic animal story and a little twist to bait you in. But was that twist enough, or is it another generic animation. Please read on to hear my opinions on the latest blockbuster.LIKES:  Very Fun  Decent song and dance numbers  Character development  Touching momentsThe thing you always hope for in a kid's movie is a fun adventure for the audience (both adults and kids). Sing does its job of providing laughs and energy, having a variety of jokes that will tickle your funny bone from time to time. Little kids will find the slapstick antics of characters farting, tripping on stage, or crashing into some sort of scenery. Adults on the other hand will embrace the funny voices, well timed delivery, and popular culture references. Whatever your style of humor, Sing will surely entertain most audience members. For a movie titled Sing, you hope for a little singing and dancing, right? Good news, there is some of that in this movie. Sing's song and dance numbers keep with the cute theme of the movie, filled with explosive colors and energy. The singing isokay in the film, but the music director picked a wide variety of tracks (from a multitude of genres) in hopes of roping all ages into the film. Their twists on some of the classics is certainly enjoyable, though doesn't quite come together like the originals. Dance numbers are again cute, but are primarily comedic relief than a true wow factor you might have expected. My main like of Sing though, is the emotional moments the directors packed into the film. The cast of aspiring singers each have their own problems (shocking right) and our heroes must face them semi-head on throughout the 90-minute run time. While the outcomes are certainly predictable, the dialogue, music, and animation are more than enough to maximize the emotions of the moment. I found my heart strings being tugged at a few of the story arcs, but enjoyed the attempt at teaching the audience some important lessons. Nevertheless, there is some simplistic character development to help around out the adventure. DISLIKES:  Different theme than presented  Many numbers were shortsighted  Dropped potential characters  Story, while touching, was kind of blandWhen I saw the trailers for Sing, I was expecting American Idol meets Zootopia. To an extent, we do get that, but it's only in the auditions part of the movie. You've seen most of the audition numbers in the trailer, and the studio didn't expand much past this. As a result, the music numbers I would hope blow me away were reduced to simplistic quips that while comical and cute, weren't that impressive. Surprisingly they are missing some genres like country, rap, and others that some audience members might have been hoping for. I guess the soundtrack will have to make up for the short bytes. In addition, the contest aspect really wasn't pursued, as the story takes a different approach to make it a completely different movie than you were expecting.This approach, as well as the short numbers, also reduced the screen time of some of the other animals you might have been hoping for. So, all those animals you see auditioning, don't get too attached, because chances are they aren't going to stick around long enough for the adventure. In addition, some of the supporting characters have limited roles, their story lines hastily wrapped up and lost in the musical numbers. And the result of all this is again an entertaining story, but one that is kind of bland and lacking suspense. The incomplete use of characters and the lack of the contest aspect took away the suspense of rooting for your favorite animal, diluting this film's potential to really drive the emotions home. The VERDICT:If you haven't guessed from my review, this film is fun, fun, fun. It has energetic song and dance numbers, some cute wholesome comedy, and yes some predictable emotional moments that we all like to see this time of year. However, the decisions to not pursue the contest, limit the engagement of the other characters, and the lack of hard-hitting numbers took away from the movie for me. Therefore, this reviewer recommends, and predicts, this film will be best enjoyed by families with little ones (who will most likely flood the theaters to see it). However, this reviewer recommends holding out to see this one at home instead of in the movie theater. Scores: Animation/Comedy/Drama: 7.5 Movie Overall: 6.5",Sing,3470600
46,Amari-Sali,"While Sing may not be a classic in the making, it still makes for a good way to spend almost 2 hours.",7/10,26 November 2016,"Review (with Spoilers) StorylineSince he was a kid Buster Moon has loved the theater. Not in terms of desiring to be a performer but more so he wanted to own one, create production, and he eventually got to do that. Problem is, he sucks at it. However, undeterred, he decides to have a singing competition. Not as a Muppet style last resort to gain funds, but as a business as usual type of thing. Unfortunately, though, his assistant Ms. Crawly makes posters not offering $1,000 but $100,000. Which brings the talent, but also brings a swath of issues for two of them really need that money.HighlightsSong ChoiceThere is a little something for everyone here. Naturally, pop hits dominate, but for those who like something old school Mike mostly does Jazz with his saxophone or Rat Pack era songs like ""My Way."" Also, there is scattered rock or pop/rock music here and there. The most notable song choice would be Johnny singing ""I'm Still Standing"" by Elton John.Meena and JohnnyMeena and Johnny are really the only two characters who are given real emotional grounding so their highs and lows matter to you. Meena seems to not have a father and is being raised by her mother's family, she is shy to the point of anxiety attacks and seems to be the only introvert in an extroverted family. One which fully supports her singing, but with her grandfather being so aggressive about her pursuing her talent, you can see he only makes things worse.Then with Johnny, he is another case of a missing parent. In his case, it is his mom but with his dad around, and his dad's criminal gang being sort of parental units, you see he is making it. Problem is, his dad has a vision and plans for Johnny which he doesn't necessarily want. So when he goes against the grain, as seen in the trailer, and gets disowned, it leaves him with no one really. His father's friends came with his dad and without him, we watch a heartbroken Johnny try to just figure out what life can be like without his dad.CriticismToo Many Characters & Not Enough DevelopmentIn order to get funding, the production companies seemed to have gotten as many name recognizable talent they could, and from there they wrote enough of a story to keep the big names happy. Not the type of story which could give depth to each character, but with it being a kid's movie, you can assume the general consensus was there is no need to get that deep. Hence why we don't explore the stress Rosita has from taking care of 25 piglets nor dealing with a unfulfilling marriage. Hence why Buster, despite being the lead, never becomes someone who can get a real emotional response out of you. For never-mind, he is a bit of a selfish butt-head for ripping off his stage hands and then taking advantage of Meena for free labor, but the one thing which could redeem him is that he is trying to make his dad's hard work pay off. The problem is with this, it more told to us than shown. Even then, it isn't like we see his dad struggle or even Buster struggle alongside him. Heck, even the one person who could have given his story some oomph, Ms. Crawley, she is purely a comedic relief. There is no development of their relationship so we can understand why she has stuck with him nor were we given an understanding why he hired her and what she means to him. I mean, she doesn't even act as a source to make Buster's dad more than just a picture trotted around to remind us how bad Buster feels about possibly losing the theater.Overall: Mixed (Home Viewing)Did I cry a little due to Meena and Johnny? Absolutely I did. However, I can't say if I didn't get to see this for free, at a screening, that I would actually pay for this. Did it have potential? Yes, it did. However, it seems like another case of having an animated movie, bloated with Hollywood stars, which is more about a money grab than creating something which has longevity.",Sing,3470600

48,ironhorse_iv,Sing is not worth singing praise about. It was just alright. Mediocre.,7/10,17 January 2017,"Besides Disney & Pixar, Illumination Entertainment has been on something of an animation roll as of late, ever since 2010's 'Despicable Me'. Despite, most of their films, not being hits with critics, their movies continue to make mad cash. Sadly, their newest movie 'Sing' is one of their weakest. Directed & written by Garth Jennings and co-directed by Christophe Lourdelet, the film tells the story of a group of anthropomorphic animals such under-appreciated pig mama Rosita (Voiced by Reese Witherspoon); the gentle son of a gorilla crime boss, Johnny (Voiced by Taron Egerton), punk-rocker porcupine Ash (Voiced by Scarlett Johansson), arrogant mouse street performer, Mike (Voiced by Seth MacFarlane) and shy elephant, teenager Meena (Voiced by Tori Kelly), who has the pipes but not the confidence, all entering a singing competition, hosted by an ambitious theater-owning koala Buster Moon (Voiced by Matthew McConaughey), who needs a hit show to save his beloved theater from foreclosure. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, the way, they introduce all these characters in the beginning of the film, was very awkward. The quick fast jump transitions was just too much. It seem, early second that it was moving, without giving enough time to establish, who they truly are. I really didn't like it. The film pacing was all over the place. Another problem with this movie is how many songs, were feature in this film. 80 songs ranging from the 1940s to 2010's is way too much for a jukebox musical. Because of this, the film's music felt more like an endless amount of swiping through Pandora than a great use of storytelling device. Plus, of the many, many pop songs used in this family film's soundtrack, there are a few that are rather explicitly not kid-friendly, including ""Butterfly"" by Crazy Town, which is subtly, about cunnilingus, and ""Anaconda"" by Nicki Minaj, which is explicitly about having intercourse. So that was weird. Honestly, the movie could had work better, if they allow a few songs to sink in, throughout the film. Instead, it felt more like white noise, for most of the 110 minute film, until the final act. Despite that, I do like the last bit of the movie, where the songs do come to characterization the revealing thoughts and feelings of a given character. For example, 'Shake it off' by singer, Taylor Swift, show Rosita's story arc, as she wants to prove to her family what a talented singer she is. Another is ""I'm Still Standing"" from music artist, Elton John is about someone who was under a negative influence, and who managed to break out of it and stand strong without it. A perfect fit to Johnny's relationship with his father. The same, can be, with 'Set it All Free' by songwriter, David Bassett, 'Don't You worry about a thing' by Stevie Wonder and 'My Way' by singer, Paul Anka. It reflects about their live, and having no regrets on how they lived it. All amazing performances from all the voice actors, even if the Seth MacFarlane one seem the most generic in how much, he sings it, outside from this film. Still, if I had to cut one, it would be, his, since it didn't seem like his Mike character had a personality arch to be nicer. He is a rat in the beginning, and still, a rodent in the end. All he manage to do, is waste screen time. However, I can praise the other actors in the roles, they were given. Each one of them, made it, their own, despite some of their cartoon animal counterpart having some characteristic stereotypes that can be view as racism like having black gorillas as violent thugs or sexism, like one character being ignored by her husband until dressing up in a promiscuous cat suit, trigger him to like her. In my opinion, it wasn't too jarring as it was in Disney version of talking animal kingdom, 2016's 'Zootopia' with its gender, socioeconomic status, and ethnicity thoughts of prejudices and discrimination. While, 'Zootopia' is by far, the better film, since it was thought-provoking and had better jokes. I thought 'Sing' did have some moments that really pull you in. The movie did had some humor that was a bit interesting. Great use of foreshadowing, and like I said before, the characters backstory is what makes this movie and their drive to win the money, unique. Yet, I do have to say, I hate how the film abandoned the competition part, toward the third act. It lesser the pressures of them, trying to achieve their goals. I would love to see, some of them, fail at it and one had success, like any other competition show. Yes, it would had be, risky, but it would be more like it is in life and would show that not everybody can have success. In my opinion, the ending was a little too child-friendly. After all, in true-life, not everything can be patch up with music. If anything, solo success destroy family units, not bring them, closer to together. Overall: Due to a few missteps, 'Sing' is not worth the price of admission. Still, it worth checking out as a rental. It's a fun movie, but it falls short of being great.",Sing,3470600

He decides to throw everything into a prize for a singing competition. His secretary Miss Crawly screws up the flyer changing the reward from $1k to $100k. This attracts many performers from all walks of life. Rosita is a pig overwhelmed by her little piglets as a housewife. Mike is a mouse busker. Ash is a porcupine in the shadow of her boyfriend in their punk duo. Meena is a shy elephant. Johnny is a gorilla from a criminal family. There is also friend sheep Eddie who is the grandson to former singing diva Nana.This is a rather generic family movie. It takes no risks and there is nothing risky here. It's a safe movie for the family but not much more. There are lots of pop songs but the performances don't usually advance the plot. Not like there's a lot of plot to advance. This is an inoffensive animated movie for kiddies and young families.

53,stevendbeard,Animal Idol,7/10,14 January 2017,"I saw ""Sing"", starring the voices of Matthew McConaughey-Free State of Jones, Mud; John C. Reilly-The Lobster, Guardians of the Galaxy; Reese Witherspoon-Hot Pursuit, Mud; Scarlett Johansson-The Avengers movies, We Bought a Zoo and Tori Kelly-in her first movie, she was a singer on American Idol & The Voice.This is an animated movie that has a world full of talking animals, instead of humans-think Zootopia. The story is kind of like an animalized version of American Idol-perhaps Animal Idol? Matthew voices a koala bear that owns a rundown theater and he is behind on his bills. He comes up with an idea of a singing competition to save the theater. More bodies in the theater means more money in his pockets. John is a llama that is Matthew's best friend. Reese as a pig, Scarlett as a porcupine and Tori as an elephant are just some of the contestants competing and the music covers over 85 songs from the 1940's to the present day-From Frank Sinatra to the Beatles to Beyonce'. There is even some music of George Michael & David Bowie included. I really enjoyed the music and the comedic parts were great, too. There is a line that Matthew says that actually might be considered the main theme of the movie: 'When you hit rock bottom, the only way to go is up!' And boy, does he hit rock bottom. This is one the whole family can enjoy. It's rated ""PG"" for some rude humor and mild peril and has a running time of 1 hour & 48 minutes. I enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD.",Sing,3470600
54,jessminecornelius,SING!...some more,9/10,22 December 2016,"This movie was equally exciting for both adults and children and honestly, I couldn't tell you which of whom had more in the audience. By the trailer alone, I could tell that this was going to be captivating due to the fact that it was not animals singing but familiar voices as well! They also sang current songs and some older songs during the audition portion but I believe that was truly them catering to their audience and they hit the nail on the head with that one. Each actor/actress delivered for their character immensely and I was shocked to see that a few of them knew how to sing! The beginning was...interesting. It caught my attention (the voice and not so much the sheep) but I was glued once the main character began to speak about his present life. The most exciting part of the movie was the lessons in it which was people will do what they want to do when they want to do it and never be afraid of doing what you are good at! I hope a sequel comes out soon!

55,monstermayhem32,A enjoyable film,7/10,21 December 2016,"I will say that the story deals with Steve moon a koala bear who wants to save his music theater from shutting down after his previous shows failed and is now desperate for some success. So he hires various acts and even has a prize for 100,000. Various characters included Rosita the pig who is the mother of twenty five piglets and a husband who is neglectful of his wife. Johnny the gorilla who dreams of being a singer tries his best to avoid falling into his fathers criminal footsteps. Meena the elephant who has fear of stage fright despite her amazing vocals. While the movie is a kids one but I will say that I considered it an adult one with adult humor.",Sing,3470600
56,invisibleunicornninja,A soulless product for the masses.,3/10,27 March 2018,"Plot - Everything is cliche and predictable. There is no creativity or originality here. There are lots of plotholes, and there is no message. This movie is extremely boring and designed to appeal to pretty much every demographic. There are several interesting ideas hidden in this movie, but they're just mixed together to create this garbage. The fact that the characters are animals doesn't contribute anything to the plot. Characters - None of the characters are original or interesting in any way. Animation - The animation is lazy, boring, and full of continuity errors. Humor - This movie has a lot to work with. There are lots of interesting ideas that could've been implemented here. There are many cheap jokes that could've been made. Surprisingly enough, this movie never (except for maybe 2 sight gags) makes a joke relating to the different species and the fact that they're animals. There isn't even anything to say about this movie because there is nothing here. This is a product designed purely to make money. There was no creativity put into this thing. The people who made this movie didn't have a story to tell - they just wanted to make money. Unfortunately the general public is stupid and they just ate up this unoriginal drivel. If you want to watch an interesting and creative animated childrens' movie where the main characters are animals, then go watch Zootopia (which this movie was banking on the popularity of). Its not the greatest movie ever, but its fun and original.",Sing,3470600
57,trevor-82944,"It Hits the Right Keys, but is Still a Rather Monotonous Tune",4/10,28 April 2017,"Well, I can certainly understand why the Golden Globes loved Illumination's thespian-infested movie. ​ Based around something as universally understood as music, Sing seems to be an appropriate first-time directing effort by the duo Christopher Lourdelet and Garth Jennings (who directed live action before). The result of their hard work brings a passable accomplishment by the studio's sixth ever full-length feature, even if no studio gamechanger nonetheless.The feature takes place in an unnamed San Fran-Los Angeles-esque city painted by Miami, home to many anthropomorphic mammals, reptiles, birds, primates, household pets, cephalopods, arachnids, and whales. We focus on six mammals: one a producer, five the lucky choices for his theater-saving singing competition. Plenty celebrity voices deliver occasionally terrific singing, although the minor roles' unfitting voices draw back the overall quality. Surprisingly however, the anthropomorphic individuals' subplots are all masterfully balanced in their yearnings on the road to fame and fortune:Buster Moon the koala (Matthew McConaughey) wants to keep the theater financially stable after his father passed down the torch. Despite being the lead, he is the least interesting cast member, more existing to vocalize the cliché morals. Though he still plays great off the more colorful characters, including his dimwitted senior secretary, Miss Crawly the iguana.Rosita the pig (Reese Witherspoon) wants to follow her passion away from her uncaring husband and twenty-five children. She soon meets unexpected challenges when the competition pairs her with an overly optimistic pig named Gunter. This widely marketed chunk of ham shockingly gets little stage time; and I should also mention how he flaunts an indistinguishable European accent exaggerated to the point of annoyance. The immature will worship him like Moccus, leaving adults to gag a bit while watching an overweight swine in a unitard stereotyping western culture.Johnny the gorilla (Taron Egerton) wants to escape his father's criminal lifestyle, and follow his heart for the microphone. Boys across all ages will relate to this highly soulful musician, despite a phoned in resolution to his subplot.Ash the porcupine (Scarlett Johansson) seeks public appreciation alongside her boyfriend/musical partner. While her story feels relatively unengaging compared to the others, she still brings a nice voice, especially when her guitar strums electrify her quills to the point of showering out.Mike the mouse (Seth MacFarlane) needs the prize money to pay back a bear gang who see him as a tasty meal. His ratty account maybe could have benefited from higher stakes against the law; but it does not matter anyway, for this crude comedian providing the voice amazingly makes a tiny crooner so ruggedly lovable with some spice thrown in.Meena the elephant (Tori Kelly) cannot pursue her love for singing, as her glossophobia gets in the way, with no thanks to her arrogant grandfather. She has the most poorly balanced yet easily relatable experience for all the boys and girls facing a similar fear.Together, doubt gets conquered in a unified walk to fame and fortune. So who ends up winning the competition?It doesn't matter! They are all too introspective to notice one another, as these well-rounded individual stories have zero interweaving amongst one another. In the end, Sing cares less about teamwork, and more about getting children to worship the most popular hits by Lady GaGa, Katy Perry, Taylor Swift, Carly Rae Jepsen, and everyone else out there (just stay through the credits, the list of songs used lasts over a minute). It doesn't matter if the human artist singles are sung by cute little animals; accompanied by predictable fart jokes, evidence proves why this movie aims squarely toward kids with an affinity of music over rules, offering the parents nothing more than a few scattered chuckles to at least manage without booing the artist offstage.",Sing,3470600
58,AlienByChoice,"Not fun or funny, not original, not inspirational. Rock bottom.",2/10,24 December 2016,"Family of four - 2 adults, one 7 year old, one 4 year old. Not one of us enjoyed it. Never mind the 4 year old. Never before have I seen my 7 year old being so bored by a movie that she wanted to walk out.If you've seen the trailers you've seen the best bits of the movie. That's it. There's nothing else to see there. I know you aren't going to believe me, but try and trust me. THIS is all there is. The exposition is boring. The story is too complicated and adult-themed for kids to understand, and too plain stupid for adults to relate to. The jokes are either too try hard (including fart jokes that even the kids didn't laugh at), or just plain misses. Racial stereotypes that wouldn't have looked out of place for a Dirty Harry movie. And for a supposedly musically themed movie, the music is pretty much absent for most of it.Here's my guess how this terrible mess happened. Imagine a Mitch Hedberg-like ""Club sandwich"" dialogue:I have an idea for a movie! A modern take on ""Fame"", but we replace the school with American Idol!Yeah, sounds good. But we've got to make it funny!OK. Funny... I know! How do you feel about talking animals?I'm for them!This movie is a go then! Let's release it in Christmas.Christmas... Then it needs to be animated.OK. Let's give to Illumination. They can polish anything.That's a deal!Bottom line. Skip it. Just skip it.

59,ethanbresnett,A surprising little treat,7/10,31 January 2022,"Sing might not reach the heights of top tier animated films, but it holds it own in a very crowded market and is a really fun and vibrant experience.A top tier A-list cast was assembled to voice the varied collection of interesting and lovable characters. They are a fun bunch to spend a couple of hours with, a good mix of characters.The story is as formulaic as they come really, but this doesn't mean it isn't fun. Any lulls are picked up by one of the many great songs chosen for the soundtrack, a real selling point of the film.The animation is very strong. All of the animals look great and the world is well put together, with lots of genius and inventive ideas to bring it to life.As with most animated film these days, there's humour aimed at both adults and children, so plenty to enjoy for all ages.Unlikely to blow you away, but you'll surely have a fun time with this one.",Sing,3470600
60,Horst_In_Translation,Much more than an animated casting show,6/10,10 December 2016,"""Sing"" is a pretty new animated movie from this year that runs for almost 110 minutes and was written and directed by Garth Jennings, a filmmaker who has been prolific in the past, but not really in the animated film genre. Actually he has not made a new movie for almost ten years and before that he mostly worked on music videos. So him being the man in charge of this film we have here is definitely a bit surprising. The cast, however, is not surprising, The voice acting participation by Oscar winners Witherspoon and McConaughey as well as the likes of Johansson and Reilly shows how great and appreciated animated films are these days. Have been for a long time actually. And the reason is that the contents and quality are on a level where you can be almost sure with every animated movie that it is at least a decent watch, sometimes even a pretty good and occasionally even a great one. The animation is always top-notch, just like this one here, and the story is convincing most of the time too.The title already gives away that music is a core component in this one. And this component is also why I believe that people from all age groups can appreciate it. There are old songs in here for adults, new songs by Perry/Swift for teenagers and basically something for every age. And the very small ones will of course not just appreciate the music, but also all the colorful fun animals that are the humans of this world, just like in ""Zootopia"". And most of them, except the koala lead character, give music performances at some point. There were kids dancing in my showing in fact, this says it all. It's almost like a music event watching this film. For me personally, the absolute highlight was the Leonard Cohen song Hallelujah because it made me think of one of my favorite musicians' recent death. It fit nicely in terms of story too because it was a quite significant scene when we hear it. But it would have been even more perfect if it came from the same character at the very end because it's the same character who also has the film's closing number.So yeah, in terms of story-telling you should not be too precise about some of the plot developments like the father suddenly loving his son or the way one character defeats her stage fright, but it's all fine. I can accept it for the feel-good moments in there and lets be honest, even if the koala was supposed to be rather smart and headstrong, he is still pretty cute. There were many scenes in this film where I enjoyed the watch a lot. It needs a while to get going in terms of the drama, but when it does, it really owns the screen. The final music number is simply gigantic and at that point I was closer to giving it an 8/10 instead of a 4/10 for sure. But let's not forget the rest of the film. 6/10 seems fairly accurate I guess. Now, a final word on the casting show references. The film eventually takes a turn away from that concept and I believe this is a good thing as this is a subject that is really nothing too glorious and it should not be appreciated in a film like this one here. Luckily, it isn't really. Only to some extent in the first hour I guess. There are references about only one band member being good enough and what the other does. Or about a group (of frogs) splitting up.On a completely different note, it is funny how the film really tries his best to be kids-friendly. The snail does not get killed, but celebrates at the end with all the other ""losers"". They are all happy finally. And there are more moments like these. You will know what I mean when you see them. As a whole, I would not call this film a triumph, but it comes pretty close at times, especially at the ending and there are some emotionally great moments in here for sure too. That's why my final verdict is that it is indeed one of the best animated films of the year. It may be a bit of a long shot for it to receive an Academy Award nomination, but I still hope it can. Or at least we can maybe even get a sequel at some point. Until then, see this one. You will most certainly not regret it.",Sing,3470600
61,dklllmwk,Why would it be this,8/10,29 December 2016,"The twists are predictable, the scenes are unlogic, 5.5/10, can't be any higher.But...wait, why would it be this? Sure those are the thoughts in my mind, but why hands are shaking, why there are jellyfishes swimming in my eyes? Although there is the most clichéd routine, and the most nonsensical plots, but with the earnest production and the performance with the true heart of every filmmaker, animator and voice actor behind the scene, there is a film provided to us, beyond compare. As a foreigner, I think those maybe the one reason why the US is great, the children in the auditorium are cheered for the roles, with the audience in the film together, when the film about ends, and then the adults are cheered with children, too. I think after years, when those children grew up, there must be someone who will always remember the night he/she had been planted a seed in the heart, named DREAM. This film is similar to La La Land, but still different. On is the love story for adults, but another one is the modern fairy tale for young and old. The only thing there are same is Dream, the eternal topic of human being. 1 point for Dream, and 1 point for cheering audience in the auditorium. 7.5/10 highly recommended.",Sing,3470600
62,briancham1994,It somehow works,6/10,31 May 2020,"This is one of those films that theoretically shouldn't work, but somehow does. All of its elements are silly, cliched and illogical, yet they all fit together into a compelling tale of everyday people's dreams. I loved Rosita's contraption, the squids' light show and Mike's obnoxious personality (not that he was enjoyable, but he was very well acted).

63,dj-berry-886-113602,An excellent show that has great music and explores the values of dreams and hard work...,10/10,27 December 2016,"This is probably my favorite movie that I've seen in a long time, and we go to the movies a lot! The music in the show is excellent and quite diverse. There's everything from classical crooning songs to teenage pop songs. There's the shy reluctant character who ends up stealing the show. The animal characters are charming, and there are the token ""bad guys,"" and some really, really good characters. Big dreams and hard work are themes that are woven throughout the movie, and something that every parent hopes that their children understand. My three year old grandson and my 6 year old grandsons sat spellbound throughout the movie. They both said that they liked it better than Moana. I think this movie is a must see for children and adults alike!

66,blott2319-1,Some good tunes in an otherwise lackluster movie,4/10,22 December 2021,"I am willing to admit that I like some reality show singing competitions. However, I tend to ride the fast-forward button when watching them, because I get terribly bored with the personal drama the showrunners try to cook up so we will get more invested in the singers. I just want to hear the songs! Well, watching Sing was like watching a long episode of The Voice or America's Got Talent. They kept trying to get me interested in these ridiculous characters, but I wanted more music, and they pushed most of that to the last 15 minutes of the movie, so it was a tough slog to get there. It doesn't help that they are telling at least 6 different stories, and the closest we get to a central protagonist is the guy running the show, who is a complete screw up and kind of a con artist. I don't gravitate to characters like that, and there were so many others that they could have focused on. If they made it all about one of the contestants, and looked primarily at their journey, it might not have made the film great, but I think it would have been better.The other big disconnect I had when it came to Sing was the fact that they made the choice to depict the characters as talking animals. I spent more than half the film wondering why, as they could have made the exact same film (with only minor little tweaks) as a live-action movie with humans. Beyond that, it didn't even seem like they chose the right animals for each character. I mean, wouldn't a rabbit make more sense as the overwhelmed mother of way too many kids, and wouldn't you expect foxes or raccoons to be the family of thieves? I won't even go into the questions this brings up in my mind about the food chain, but I guess they largely avoided that by featuring mostly herbivores. The saddest thing about Sing is that the music is absolutely great when they get there. I wanted to be mad at the film, but it left me on such a high note, I was smiling when the credits rolled. I'm a little conflicted on Sing, but I think I'd rather spend time listening to the soundtrack than watching the movie again.",Sing,3470600

Tori Kelly in this is amazing!! oh my gosh! she has such energy and heart to her character and I just loove her soooo much!

68,iguth,So much fun,8/10,11 May 2019,"All-star cast with a quirky premise. The animation is good however it fails to use such animation to the movies advantage. Unlike Zootopia that creates a world only possible in animation, this movie puts animals in an already familiar world. There is little to no reason for them to be animals for any reason. Luckily this allows the creators to focus more on story. Before you can talk about the story you have to talk about the folks in it. The cast is very well acted, funny, and surprisingly talented when it comes to singing. You really get to hear the voices of some folks that you wouldn't often think to have amazing vocal skills. Now the plot is generally good. There is a nice story revolving around a guy with a dream who can't make it a reality and has a last second hurrah. The individual plotlines of each of the characters are all interesting and if I'm being honest Johnny has one of the best plots I've seen just in general. Overall a solid animated film with some high quality music.

69,TheMovonka,What a pity...,5/10,15 December 2016,"I fear Sing"" has to be described as nice. Only nice. With this short sentence I don't want to disappoint any fans or viewers, but it is the best thing I can say about this ambitious music movie.With emotions, fun and great singers to perform hits and mashups to entertain the audience like Sister Act, Pitch Perfect or other music oriented movies, Sing should have been a great flick in the pre-Christmas time. At least the trailer looked like this.In the end, we got an superficial, easy going kids movie with slight laughter and standard radio hits we all hear every day. Besides maybe one original track, it appears that creators licensed only from one or two sources to allow themselves flexibility in music selection. In combination with a straight forward story-line with no twists, deepness or surprises, it is mostly interesting for children who loves a koala bear in a suit.Instead of going out of the theater with music in my head, a song to sing along and a great feeling inside, I felt as I have seen a mainstream short term typical kids TV movie on a Sunday afternoon with some music aside. Seen and forgotten – What a pity",Sing,3470600
70,jack-davy,Let's Not Get Carried Away Here..,4/10,28 January 2017,"Okay, so I am very confused here as to how this film is so highly rated.The animation itself and the sound design and music etc, is very well done. But considering its predecessors ('Illumination Entertainment') are Despicable Me & Minions, we have come to expect this high level of professionalism.The film as a whole was underwhelming and felt very flat. Twenty minutes into the film and the story was already very much underway and much of the 'laughs' - sorry, ALL of the 'laughs' - I had already witnessed from the countless trailers and adverts I have been subjected too since they were released about five months ago. Hence, by the time the film was finally released (Jan. 27th - UK & Ireland) the jokes were neither funny nor interesting and I was very bored.Moreover, the cinema packed with children and their tired parents let out VERY few laughs for the jokes and throughout the film, it was relatively silent from the audience. I could almost hear the children shuffling in their seats, eight rows behind me.The characters offered nothing new and it was a happy ending for all. Which confused me even more seeing as the obnoxious mouse got away Scott-free with his slutty mouse friend in his snazzy red sports car, paid for by the money he stole from the bears by cheating at poker.WHAT MESSAGE IS THAT FOR CHILDREN?!I have no idea. I have NO idea.Bottom line, the film suffered from being over-hyped, bringing us nothing new and a theme that was very confusing. The songs used were performed well and I appreciated the concept of the animated-take on today's singing competitions. But let's not get carried away here, the film is just about average.",Sing,3470600
71,bradencn,All Star Casted Films Shouldn't Get Off this Easy,4/10,27 December 2016,"First things first, the singing was fantastic, comical, and enjoyable. Who knew that Taron Egerton had a voice like that? The film did do a good job of tying several different genres of music nicely to make this enjoyable musically. That is perhaps the only exciting creative part of this film.The story, however, was bland, flat, and boring. I don't quite understand how they could have missed the mark. To avoid any spoilers, I can safely say that the story is quite predictable-sure, some things happen that you wouldn't be able to guess-but, from the very beginning, you know generally what will happen in the middle of the movie, and what will happen at the end.Generally, predictability is typical of a children's film, which this is; although, it does play to the hearts of adults, by bringing in elements of the burdens of family responsibility and the stress of going into debt. However, in stellar children films, that predictability is out-weighed by brilliant humor, emotional connections with characters, and a feeling of sinking into the world of the film. Think of ""Cars (1),"" ""Finding Nemo,"" ""Toy Story,"" and ""Tangled."" Great films, general predictability, but an incredible script and a unique story line.This film, though, misses on so many levels. The characters seem to have neat backstories, but there is no depth to any of them. You can only barely connect to the characters. It was so disappointing.It's a good movie to have on in the background, but beyond that, it really isn't worth it. It really could have just been so much better.",Sing,3470600
72,valen060,"Predictable and Average with Melodious, Musical Fun",7/10,30 December 2016,"For Illumination Entertainment to release the next animated flick in the same year as their recent hit The Secret Life of Pets, I was left even more curious as to what their follow-up Sing can belt out. The moment I walked into that theater and watched it in its entirety, it left me both entertained and in stitches as to see what these characters are capable of.The equation to me is like: Zootopia + American Idol + a hint of Glee = SingSo Buster Moon, a koala and owner to his local theater is falling on hard times as no one is interested in the shows he puts on. When he and his associates Eddie (a male sheep) and the elderly Ms. Crawly (an iguana) decide to put together a singing competition for all the locals, he hopes it's the only way to save his theater from being taken away from him.Although the singing prowess is all there in the anthropomorphic animal characters and were definitely superb to hear from each of their respective voice actors (Taron Egerton, Scarlett Johansson, and even Seth MacFarlane certainly stood out with both speaking and singing) it's a plot that feels too routine and a tendency to be predictable when it comes to the more pivotal moments in the movie. The scenario started to slowly remind me of the old 1997 Warner Bros. movie ""Cats Don't Dance"" in terms of has-been or aspiring individuals that would do anything to make it big in the limelight. In spite of the littler ones (and I even noticed some much older adults) being kept amused by the off-color humor and various renditions of hit songs each character sang, it's pretty much average fun for families of all ages. It's no ""Moana"" and feels like a low-budget ""Zootopia,"" but it's a bipedal, animated musical comedy that's not afraid to stand in the spotlight. The ending song ""Faith"" by legend Stevie Wonder and Ariana Grande is also a catchy tune. No wonder it got some recognition for awards season. A lesser effort, but melodious enough to hear.",Sing,3470600
73,donovanwyatt-50274,Sing!,8/10,8 April 2018,"I can carry a tune; carefully with both hands... but that's about it. I'm like most people who've got an ear for music but no talent for the singing; more than slightly obsessed with animated singing cartoons. But you can't just go throwing some tunes on screen and expect me to be all in. I've got standards, blame Disney and Pixar, you must hit me somewhere good and give me a reason to add you to my wall of animated singing glory (yes, I have a shelf of movies that all require singing to happen - sooooo).Sing has a back story familiar in the animated movie world. Anthropomorphized animals living in a parallel world to the human world going through life struggles with theme songs and musical soliloquies. But it doesn't feel like it's already been """"done"""" and the daily life and struggles in this town populated by animals provides a relatable background to pull you into the story without wasting opportunities for authentic and touching moments made more so by combining them with satirical hilarity and off-color humor - there a very good reason it's PG and not G.Buster Moon is a too slick for his own good theater owner who's living his life one step ahead of creditors and a final cut off notice from the electric company. Clinging to his dream has brought out the huckster in him. Buster voiced by Mathew McConaughey comes across more as unbelievably optimistic than shifty - trust me this character cuts it a little close to the ponzi-scheme runner edge. You've got the quirky (glass eye-having) ancient-as-all-get-out assistant who of course has our beleaguered theater owners back no matter how much things are falling apart or going awry. She makes a massive mistake (this is why copy editing is important before going to press, people) which becomes the secret waiting in the wings to drop the other shoe of disaster on Buster's head... or so you think.Each of the contestants have a mini-backstory that explains what brings them (or holds them back from) to the stage and there's something in each storyline to interest each movie go-er:You've got the rock chick Ash (voiced by Scarlett Johansson) playing second string to her boyfriend with delusions of rock greatness Lance (voiced by Beck Bennett).The talented stay-at-home mom Rosita (voiced by Reese Witherspoon) who put her career aspirations aside to marry and raise her (25) children and support her career-focused, completely tuned out husband, Norman (Nick Offerman).Smooth-talking street hustler and saxophonist Mike (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) looking to parlay his participation - an anticipation of winning the big prize - in the singing competition into cash that opens the doors to the life of status, luxury, and wealth he's intent on becoming accustom to.Street tough Johnny (voiced by Taron Egerton) son of """"smash and grab"""" gang leader Big Daddy (voiced Peter Serafinowicz) he's living - reluctantly - with both feet in the underworld and his heads in the clouds where the music's calling his name.Then there's Meena (voiced by Tori Kelly) sweet and shy with a killer voice and a huge case of stage fright with a little social anxiety to even things out.They're all here for different reasons. They'll be at least one you can behind. The secondary characters and scenes add color and flavor like any good animated movie should. The music is an ode to some of the best (and worst) popular music as to offer. There's a good enough mixed bag of songs from past decades (it's a little like name that tune with the song snippets) to hit the spot for all age groups. Honestly some of the best irony and hilarity in the movie are the song match-ups to animal characters during the audition process. It's well drawn and nicely paced to keep you interested and entertained. The story has its sad moments - let's just say I have mad respect for what Buster's dad did to raise the money for him to buy the theater in the first place - coupled with ridiculousness to keep it from being bogged down in the maudlin.This movie isn't trying to make you dig for deep emotions or push you to make sweeping philosophical changes to your life view. But it's got some down to earth and simplistic lessons about being honest, asking for help, owning your mistakes, and not giving up.Sing is part love letter to the shrinking world of theater and live music venues and a call to arms for going after your dreams and seeing your success as possible long after everyone else has written you off. It's equal parts simple entertainment and commentary into how we relate to ourselves and each other.It's not the best I've ever seen but it certainly makes my list movies I'll watch to adjust my mood without putting me through the ringer.An animated movie sprinkled with musical moments about a down on his luck koala trying to save his dream by hosting a singing competition that in turn fuels the ambition of other dreamers...that's totally what we need for the Holiday viewing schedule. Right?Why yes, yes, it is.",Sing,3470600
74,christophershobris,Best Film So Far By Illumination,5/10,3 January 2017,"This is what Illumination is capable and what happens when they go beyond minions. While its not a perfect film it is an eye opener for me in terms of what Illumination can do as a company. To me they are still not as good as Disney or DreamWorks but Illumination impressed me with Sing. Here is why. The plot is very original, not many animated films have singing as a topic. Even though a month before we got Trolls, which is still unique in its interpretations. The voice acting and singing by the actors and actresses is superb. Some of the actors surprised me like Seth MacFarlane, he showed his singing talent and can do more then just Family Guy. But the flaws are present. The characters are not the most memorable. The reason is that there is so many of them there is never really any time to get to know them on a personal level. Many side characters are thrown in and none really stand out. It just a bunch of random characters who want to achieve a certain goal. The character design is also a little distracting, but that's just a nit-pick, and the animation itself is decent but not on the level of Zootopia. So those are my thoughts and now here are my grades. Music: B+ Story: A- Characters: C Animation: B Overall: B-",Sing,3470600

It was beyond any expectations I ever had.Never had I experienced so much emotions, thoughts, feelings. My heart raced and tears fell. There were some truly iconic moments that will always be remembered down the line as a cinematic legacy. I would like to keep this review spoiler-free as it is just such an amazing experience to go through for the first time, therefore I implore you to PLEASE WATCH IT.In conclusion, I believe that Sing is not only the greatest movie and piece of media ever made, I believe it truly defines and highlights the best parts of humanity. I would not be sitting here, right now, typing this review if not for this movie as it has single-handedly saved my life more times than I can count.",Sing,3470600
76,Mr-Fusion,Top 40 exuberance,5/10,19 March 2017,"Looking at ""Sing"" from a family movie standpoint, it's pretty solid. This is your usually candy-colored kids movie, but it's clean, fun and really just wants to get the audience moving. My wife and daughter really liked this, and I guess that's really all you need if you're looking for such a movie.It's somewhat a disappointment for me because, even with its familiar ""save the theater"" theme, it feels more like American Idol than the Muppets. Granted, it's impressive that fifty year-old songs found their way onto the setlist, but the focus is unquestionably modern. Getting to the point of why this movie is not really my bag, it's really just the music.5/10

(Well, maybe not official official, but it might as well be. And, by animal, I'm referring to all non-humans appearing in 2016 movies.) Going into the last week of 2016, four of the year's top 5 movies in terms of worldwide box office receipts either starred or were completely inhabited by creatures other than homo sapiens. But the trend goes well beyond ""Finding Dory"", ""Zootopia"", ""The Secret Life of Pets"", and ""The Jungle Book"". Let's not forget ""Kung Fu Panda 3"", ""Ice Age: Collision Course"", ""Monster Hunt"", ""The Legend of Tarzan"", ""The Angry Birds Movie"", ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows"", ""The Monkey King 2"", ""Storks"", ""Pete's Dragon"", ""Shin Godzilla"", ""The Wild Life"", ""Keanu"", ""Nine Lives"", ""Norm of the North"" and even 100% live action movies like the surreal Danish import ""Men & Chicken"" and the wonderful documentary ""The Eagle Huntress"". Filmmakers even evoked animal imagery in the titles of many of their movies that had nothing (or almost nothing) to do with animals (such as ""War Dogs"", ""Eddie the Eagle"", ""The Lobster"", ""Nocturnal Animals"" and ""Lion""). Yes, 2016 was a banner year for our furry, scaly and feathered friends on the big screen. Then, right at the end of the year comes one more addition to the list (and another animated movie featuring a world of anthropomorphic animals): ""Sing"" (PG, 1:48).Buster Moon (the voice of Matthew McConaughey) wants what any city-dwelling koala bear wants – to run a musical theater! He's wanted it since he saw his first live performance at the age of six. Buster's koala dad slaved away at a car wash for years until he made enough money for Buster to realize his dream. Buster bought the theater that he first visited with his father and has run it into the ground. The shows that he stages keep losing money, he can't afford to pay the help and the bank is threatening to repossess the theater. But Buster has always been a dreamer and he's no quitter. His latest idea is to stage a singing competition with open auditions. His best friend, a sheep named Eddie (John C. Reilly), thinks it's a terrible idea and encourages him to consider selling the theater, but Buster is undeterred.Buster has his loyal, elderly and scatter-brained one-eyed iguana of an assistant, Miss Crawley (voiced by Garth Jennings who also wrote and directed the film) to print out fliers advertising a prize that he really can't afford to offer and animals from all over the city line up to audition. The story follows several different aspiring animal singers as they pursue their dreams, but focuses a little more on a frazzled homemaker with a great voice. Rosita (Reese Witherspoon) is a pig who is burdened with a brood of 25 piglets and a self-absorbed workaholic husband (Nick Offerman). What's more, for the show Buster pairs her with a fat German pig named Gunter (Nick Kroll) whose larger-than-life personality is the complete opposite of the reserved Rosita's demeanor – and Gunter insists that she dance in their performance.The contestants whom Buster selects are all talented singers, but, like Rosita, each of them has personal issues that may prevent them from even making it through the rehearsal process. Johnny (Taron Egerton) is a cockney-accented gorilla who has kept his love of singing secret from his dad (Peter Serafinowicz), a criminal who has been getting Johnny involved in his gang – AND Buster wants Johnny to learn to play the piano in time for the show! Ash is a teenage porcupine who is cast in the show without her boyfriend (Beck Bennett), with whom she auditioned – and then she is asked to sing songs that she feels are too cheesy for her punk-rock sensibilities and wants to try writing her own music. Mike (Seth McFarlane) is a mouse who croons like Frank Sinatra and has an ego bigger than any member of the human Rat Pack which gets him into trouble with some big, bad, card-playing bears. And then there's Meena (Tori Kelly), an elephant with a gorgeous voice, but paralyzing stage fright. As each of these dreamers tries to work through his or her individual challenges, Buster works desperately to bring his last-chance show together and hold his theater together financially, emotionally and even physically.""Sing"" is a lot of fun, but has some flaws which may drive adult Movie Fans to distraction. The characters are full of personality, the soundtrack is full of great songs (bits of over 80 of them from the 1940s to the 2010s, including a couple original compositions) and the film is full of vibrant and detailed animation. On the other hand, some of the plot points are more unrealistic than I can deal with (even in an animated musical comedy) and the majority of the main characters don't seem to deserve the chance to reach their goals. Since kids make up such a large portion of the audience for an animated feature film like this one, knowing that several of the characters seem like they're being rewarded for bad behavior may give some parents pause. Besides all of that, the story is formulaic and the plot feels contrived but the film does contain positive messages about working hard for your dreams, overcoming obstacles sometimes being its own reward and people (or, in this case, animals) working together and appreciating each other, in spite of their differences and flaws. Feeling that this film is a mixed bag, I can't quite bring myself to sing the praises of ""Sing"", but it has enough going for it to earn a mild recommendation. ""B""",Sing,3470600
78,margulanabutrlov,Sing Review,10/10,23 March 2019,"Failed impresario Buster Moon (Matthew McConaughey) has a brainwave: to revive the fortunes of his ailing theatre with a singing competition; one that attracts a motley crew of animal entrants.
Garth Jennings' last movie was the heart-warming and imaginative Son Of Rambow, a small but perfectly formed personal film that served both as an antidote to his first, the fun but flawed adaptation of The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy, and a calling card for what he could do with gentler material. We waited with bated breath to see what he'd do next. And waited. And waited.
Finally, a decade on, he's made his next move, and in a guise nobody could have expected. The path between animated films and live action has been well-trodden in recent years, but Jennings has become one of the few directors to cross in the opposite direction, rocking up at Chris Meledandri's Illumination Studios.
Illumination's output over the years may have been wildly successful, but from a creative point of view their work has been middle of the road, bland and lacking in true inspiration. While Jennings' presence hasn't quite led to a Pixar-level bump in quality, this is a clear step up from the likes of The Secret Life Of Pets and the endless Minions-related movies.
As the title might suggest, Sing is a full-blown musical. But you may not be prepared for just how full-blown it is. Across its 108 minutes blast some 84 songs. And while many of those come in snatches and bursts, that's still almost a song per minute. On the surface, this doesn't feel as close to Jennings' heart as Son Of Rambow, but as a man who made his name as one half of Hammer & Tongs, creators of some of the '90s most iconic pop videos (Blur's Coffee & TV and Supergrass' Pumping On Your Stereo among them), his love of music infuses every frame.
And this isn't just a standard selection of modern chart hits, either - for every nod to Taylor Swift, there's a deep cut album track from a musical legend. Any movie that places such importance on The Beatles' excellent Golden Slumbers has its ears in the right place.
The musical onslaught is symptomatic of the film itself, which flits about furiously like a coked-up koala. Though McConaughey's hyperactive Buster Moon is at the heart of the story, there are eight or nine principal characters (not counting substantial support from Peter Serafinowicz as a gruff Cockney silverback and Jennings himself as a batty lizard secretary) all vying for screentime. Jennings rarely cuts between them, instead sending his virtual camera hurtling through the city at breakneck speed from storyline to storyline. It can be a little dizzying.
Thankfully, those characters are entertaining enough to make the bombardment bearable. And even if the message ultimately peddled here is the same 'believe in yourself' self-help mantra as a thousand other animated movies, there are just enough unexpected quirks in the storytelling (let's just say the singing contest doesn't become the X Factor facsimile you might expect) and enough infectious fun to make it stand out.

79,blazedounal,Best movie for kid,10/10,21 March 2017,"I was so utterly impressed, never got bored and thought it was a kiddie movie, never not wanting to hear the next song. Starring the film was an all star cast, too many to name and they all did a spectacular job singing and acting, the main star that gave me goosebumps singing was Tori Kelly, she can sing the house down. Sing is best movie for kid.In a world of anthropomorphic animals, koala Buster Moon owns a theater, having been interested in show business since his father took him to his first music show as a child. Following financial problems brought up by the bank representative Judith, he tells his friend Eddie that he will host a singing competition with a prize of $1,000. But Buster's assistant, Ms. Crawley, accidentally write $100,000.Animals from all around the city gather for auditions. Those selected include: housewife and mother of 25 piglets Rosita; street musician mouse Mike; mobster's son gorilla Johnny; and punk-rock porcupine Ash. Shy teenage elephant Meena bombs her audition out of stage fright, while Ash's boyfriend Lance is dismissed from the contest. Rosita is paired with another pig contestant named Gunter for a dancing routine. Although Buster discovers the flyers show a prize of $100,000, money he does not have, he remains optimistic. Buster convinces Eddie to arrange a visit with Eddie's grandmother, former opera singer and theater actress Nana, to persuade her to sponsor the prize money. She is hesitant to contribute, but agrees to see a private screening of the show.Encouraged by her grandfather, Meena tries to ask Buster for another chance, but becomes his stage hand instead. When some of the other acts quit, Meena is added as an act. Rosita flounders in her dance routine with Gunter, having been distracted by her parenting duties that have fallen into disarray. After discovering Lance with a new girlfriend Becky and evicting them from her apartment, Ash is heartbroken and in no state to sing her assigned song ""Call Me Maybe"". Johnny is torn between having to help his father as the driver of the getaway car. When Johnny tries to do both, he does not show up for the planned pickup, and his father and his gang are arrested. Meena does not get any help overcoming her stage fright, and Mike, certain the prize money is as good as his, buys a fancy car to impress a girl mouse, and fights a group of bears in a card game at a nightclub.The day of the screening, the bears interrupt the show, demanding the money from Mike, who in turn, points to Buster. The bears open the chest containing the prize money, but it is nowhere near $100,000. The glass tank full of luminescent squids that Buster got to light up the theater breaks, and floods the theater, which then comes crashing down. With the lot repossessed by Judith, Buster, who had been living in his theater's office desk, takes up residence at Eddie's place. Buster tries to start over by opening a car wash, using the same bucket that his dad had used to earn money for Buster's theater.When Meena goes to the theater's rubble lot and sings Leonard Cohen's ""Hallelujah"", Buster hears her and is inspired to reinstate the show without the prize money. They perform in front of Rosita and Meena's family members. As Rosita and Gunther perform ""Shake It Off"", more animals are attracted to the scene as the show is broadcast on the news. Johnny's rendition of ""I'm Still Standing"" impresses his father, who then escapes from prison to reconcile with him. Despite interruption by Judith, Ash sings her original rock song ""Set It All Free"", impressing Lance. Mike returns when his peers make fun that he was not able to sing like the ones on television and sings ""My Way"". Meena finally overcomes her fears and sings Stevie Wonder's ""Don't You Worry 'bout a Thing.""The show becomes a success and impresses Nana, who was in the audience. Nana buys the lot, and the theater is rebuilt and reopened.",Sing,3470600

I'm 39 years-old but I absolutely loved it. I loved the hilarious script and the stunning design (you can't get enough of it), especially the looks and personalities of all the characters. If you pay attention to the details, you will be laughing out loud all the time. And what about the gorilla with an angel voice? What about Gunther the dancing pig with a German accent? What an amazing movie for both kids and adults! A real feel-good flick that reminded me of Zootopia because that one was also amazing and it also makes you totally happy inside. Nothing about Sing feels contrived or fake, it's simply an adorable story with great songs in it and lots of cute and funny stuff. I know it doesn't sound like a good movie the way I put it, but it really is. And I was shocked to discover the actors behind the voices - and I mean singing voices. Scarlett Johannson doing a rock song? That was a blast. And Taron Egerton doing the angel voice gorilla? Don't make me laugh, but oh my God, I want to have his record on my shelf yesterday.

83,ericstevenson,Certainly good enough,7/10,16 June 2018,"I think this movie at one point had the most viewed trailer in movie history. It's since been replaced by ""Avengers: Infinity War"". I was really impressed by that as this movie is based on a completely original idea, right? Well, the story's pretty basic with a koala holding a singing competition. A lot of stuff from the trailer is only in the first 20 minutes. My favorite character might be Mike the mouse.I couldn't recognize Seth Macfarlane's voice at all! I'm not going to spoil it, but the way his storyline is resolved is very satisfying. The animation is great and it's a really interesting world these characters live in. I admit that some of it is clichéd and the characters probably aren't the most original. I still rooted for most of them and it's pretty realistic for a movie about talking animals. I counted 64 songs in the credits! ***

By taking the mold of a ""let's-put-on-a-show"" style revue, Sing aptly intermingles two of the most widespread popular culture phenomena cooked up over the last quarter-century: singing competitions and talking furry animals. The whole thing pretty much writes itself. Yet just because the film lives comfortably amid expected clichés, and risks very little in being upbeat, doesn't mean it's any less vibrant, sincere and fun.That sincerity is primarily worn on the sleeve of one Buster Moon (McConaughey), a theater owner whose last few shows have failed to generate any excitement. In a last ditch effort to save his theater from foreclosure, Moon banks everything on a singing competition with a grand prize of $1,000. Due to a printing mishap, a couple of zeros are added on to the prize, peaking the attention of every struggling and wannabe vocal star within city limits. Such talents include an under-appreciated housewife of 25 piglets (Witherspoon), a teenage porcupine (Johansson), an ape whose father would rather see his son follow his footsteps (Egerton), an egotistical crooner with a propensity for Rat Pack music (McFarlane) and an elephant with bad stage fright (Kelly).Much of the movie juggles between the stories of its supporting cast, all of which we only get cliff notes of their foibles. At times it can be a bit jarring; like listening to the radio while someone else if flipping through your favorite channels. Yet when the film finally settles into its groove, the diversity of the cast, and how well they gel together, goes a pretty long way. We get to see them struggle through rehearsal and balance their personal lives with the limelight. Not all of them get along, and as with any stage show, things don't always go according to plan, forcing them to test their metal. At the center of it all is Moon, the stubborn, foolhardy Koala whose dreams are barely held together by a defiant can-do attitude.It all pretty much unfolds as you would expect. The only real surprises to be had don't come up within the story but rather the audience guessing which character will be flipping the switches most often on the plot mechanics. Since that burden is so evenly divided among the cast, we feel like we're spending more valuable time with them and get a sense of satisfaction when our favorite character's circuit is finally closed.People will no doubt compare Sing to Zootopia (2016) due to their superficial similarities. I would think a more apt comparison would be Trolls (2016) which, like Sing tried to drown out unpleasantness with unfettered chirpiness. Yet here there's a little something for everyone. Who you are, and in some cases what you listen to, basically determines which character/s you will most easily identify with. Permeating through all the stories is just enough adversity for characters to understand the stakes. Thus the comforting cheerfulness feels not just natural but earned.Call it a feeling of magnanimity before the Holiday season but in my humble opinion Sing is just what the doctor ordered. It's a fun, breezy, goofy little jukebox musical that is pretty much the movie equivalent of comfort food. It may not leave you with a lasting smile but it will give you a smile nonetheless.",Sing,3470600
86,jakep3,So Good,9/10,6 March 2019,"This movie is great. My daughter loves it (which means I've seen it four time already), and you know what? I'm not sick of it yet. The story and characters are good, I love a story that works out but not the way the players expected them to.But where this one really shines for me was the animation. Nerdy, I know. But watch the reflections in the car doors, the bottles of olive oil in the grocery store, the water, the hairs on the animals. It's those near perfect little details that are quite an achievement in realism.Definitely worth at least one watch.

87,austin0731,a mixed bag with a good message at the core,5/10,11 December 2016,"Sing is a mediocre entry in my opinion, although I must say it made quite a recovery from its second act onwards. The entire first act seemed more like cutscenes after cutscenes rather than a fluent storytelling. I felt that the characters were very clichéd and two dimensional which really makes the film lose compared to the high quality of animation films we have gotten recently, yes 2016 is quite the year for animations yet this film seems to have taken a couple steps back. What tore me between my opinion however is the payoff we got in the third act, it was quite spectacular and redeemed itself in my opinion. I would commend the film for the message and insight on showbiz, the film does not ease the ride but really reflects reality in a very brutally honest way. But great insight and message without good execution really can't make me feel impressed with this film. It is really quite a shame that this film did not deliver because it had such a wonderful message behind it. Now despite the criticism I do see that this is a family film not targeted towards those who view films more critically. However in a day and age like this in which we are going to get films such as 'cars 3', the animation industry is really stepping its game up, in terms of building worlds and characters with more depth than ever, these studios are really starting to create content that is really for all ages. So I believe that if illumination was to continue to thrive they really must evolve and adapt as well, I do not doubt the stardom of the minions but it's only a matter of time before we get over them.",Sing,3470600
88,AussieMovieReviews,Family fun to put a smile on your face.,7/10,10 January 2017,"7/10. A Koala who owns a theatre, decides to throw a singing competition for some big prize money. This is a fun and entertaining animation for the whole family. Matthew McConaughey voices The lead character, a Koala named Buster Moon. And he does an amazing job putting emotion into the character. This movie has an outstanding soundtrack, with music throughout. I found all the animal characters to be fun and unique. Keep an ear out for Tori Kelly's Character, an elephant named Meena, her voice is amazing. A great film for little kids, or big kids. Sing Movie #sing

89,jmicjames,Great for the young ones,9/10,19 March 2019,"Great movie for the young ones. Lots of action and music to sing along to. Keeps them busy and interested while keeping the adults interested also. Very much enjoyed this one. Great for family movie night.

91,topeka_brooks,"I laughed, I cried",10/10,17 January 2017,"Best film of 2016, and we've had some good ones this year.The film is a kid's flick, and family entertainment. But if you can get past the excellent CGI, and the juvenile aspirations: Sing sings to the heart of everyone who has tried to overcome a doubting Thomas.Got a boyfriend, or girlfriend, wife, parent, or boss who doesn't believe in you?? ... You will understand the film and its inspiration.A few criticisms are in order, but as it's not my job: Who cares? I loved the flick, and I only wish Hollyweird would do more films like this one.Those who do not see the film under the misapprehension they will see nothing more than another Disney film for kids are missing a rich treat celebrating both theater and talent. And a lot of pop music.",Sing,3470600
92,scrunkly,"There's only one way to go, and that's up!",8/10,3 January 2022,"Isn't it incredible how an animated movie about elephants and mice getting along can be so touching? I'm definitely not the only one who thinks it. Sing (2016) is a love letter to those who believe anyone, no matter how scrawny or hulk infused, can show their musical talents. Obviously, not everyone can sing and that's probably okay. For what it's worth, it's a huge step forward from Pitch perfect (2012). Buster moon is a terrific protagonist who brings life to the stage, with his optimistic attitude and undying love for his to be wedded husband, Eddie Noodleman, i couldn't have picked a better protagonist! Props to illuminations on this one, I see they took the Minions critiques well xD Uncle Markus admired this one deeply before his passing, and while that seriously scared the kids at first, they eventually came round to understanding the movies true underlying beauty. Oh, and of course, the musical chair scene gets us all the time xD Definitely influenced the kids during supper to go wild! Walmart won't be happy about our frequent home decor visits! In a way, we are all just elephants and mice, waiting for a chance to rise to stardom. But don't wait my dear, miracles start with you <3.",Sing,3470600
93,pbartbar,Had my doubts but.....,10/10,6 January 2017,"WOW! I had my doubts before going but it was a family event with our daughter and her husband and our granddaughter so I went. All skepticism disappeared in the first 5 minutes of the film. All I can say is the singing sent chills up my spine and the character voices were phenomenal. This is definitely an uplifting movie. The animation was as good as I have ever seen in a movie and the story line was something you could expect to see in the real world so it was very easy to get into. Some of the actors doing the voice overs I have never heard of but they were fantastic. You cannot go wrong seeing this. We will definitely be buying the Bluray when it comes out.

94,AzureTay,Sing,4/10,15 April 2022,"I don't like this movie. It wasn't awful, painful, or bad, but it was shockingly lazy and predictable. The characters are flat, tension is always dropped for heartfelt feel good moments, everyone's a winner all the time, and character assets are reused dozens upon dozens of times. It is lazily put together and presented to the audience with the tag line of ""Children are stupid.""Illumination Entertainment has earned a reputation for being lazy cash grabs making something just good enough so they can make bank. This is no different. The reputation is well earned, and plenty of people have pointed out how Illumination doesn't value the artistry of their product, they value the product. That being said, Sing isn't bad, it is a movie about talking and singing animals, and it delivers on that promise well enough, it has a verified enough, if flat cast that will encourage the audience to root for and pick a favorite. However, in all earnesty, if you want to see singing and dancing Animals there are countless movies that do it better. I'd personally suggest Cats don't Dance, a 1997 movie with a great cast, story, and animation.On that note, one of the directors, and the writer for this movie is Garth Jennings who directed and wrote Son of Rambow (2007) by no stretch a perfect movie, but a good one. A movie I really like. As well as directing the 2005 adaptation of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, by no stretch perfect, but once more a movie I really liked. So it baffles me how someone who has two pretty good movies, live action movies, and dozens of music videos was able to direct such a lackluster animated movie.In a word, I find this movie vapid. It doesn't have much of a heart, and the times it looks like there will be drama, it boils down to, ""No you can't sing."" ""I will sing"" Character that didn't want them to sing hears it and goes, ""I was wrong, please keep singing."" No conflict lasts more than a few scenes at best,some of them are wrapped up in the same scene the conflict is introduced in. Sometimes it feels like the story was bored of what it was doing and introduces or drops the sub plot on a whim.Overall: 4 out of 10. I don't like it and think it is a waste of time, but it isn't bad. It does the worst thing a movie can do, it is mediocre.Spoiler Stuff
There is nothing to spoiler. The movie does what it says, and yes, it happens exactly like that. No twists, no turns, no subversions.",Sing,3470600
95,artbug-21197,Not as innocent as it seems,2/10,10 January 2017,"I was not impressed with this film at all. It is supposedly targeted at young kids and families, but I do not agree. I did not appreciate the casual, off-hand references to adult content. Twerking (when the bunnies are auditioning to a Nikki Manaj song, swinging their behinds at the audience and singing 'Oh my God, look at her butt'), smoking drugs (at a party/club one of the animals looks at an inhaler and asks ""What do you smoke in this?""), and the underlying fact that one of the animals is living with her boyfriend. Depending on the values that parents want to instill in their children, this movie is questionable. Because young kids are like sponges that soak up everything they see and hear, parents need to be careful and considerate before showing this film to their children.",Sing,3470600
