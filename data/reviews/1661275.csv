Don't confuse facts with truth, don't let them get in way of the story.'",9/10,3 September 2017,"Danish director Lone Scherfig (An Education, Italian for Beginners, One Day) knows her way around British humor, feminism, WW II, and the art and at times chaos of making a movie. Based on a novel by Lissa Evans and adapted for the screen by Gaby Chiappe, THEIR FINEST is a brilliant little film about making a film under duress and how all members of the film crew – stars to stuntmen and cameramen – interact. It is also a fine punch in the ribs for British views of Americans – not only during the 1940s but now also!Caitlin Cole (Gemma Atherton) lives with struggling and wounded Welsh painter Ellis Cole (Jack Huston) and they strive to exist on a minimal income. During the London Blitz of World War II, Caitlin is recruited by the British Ministry of Information to write scripts for propaganda films that the public will actually watch without scoffing. In the line of her new duties, Cole investigates the story of two young women who supposedly piloted a boat in the Dunkirk Evacuation. Although it proved a complete misapprehension, the story becomes the basis for a fictional film with some possible appeal. As Cole labors to write the script with her new colleagues such as Tom Buckley (Sam Claflin), veteran actor Ambrose Hilliard (Bill Nighy) must accept that his days as a leading man are over as he joins the project. Together, this disparate trio must struggle against such complications such as sexism against Cole, jealous relatives, the drive to make the American movie public react n support of England in the war effort, and political interference from the Secretary of War (Jeremy Irons) in their artistic decisions even as London endures the bombs of the enemy. In the face of those challenges, they share a hope to contribute something meaningful in this time of war and in their own lives.The film has complex characterizations (Rachel Stirling is brilliant in what at first seems a minor but controlling role, Eddie Marsan has a meaningful cameo, Helen McCrory as Eddie Marsan's meddling sister) and the entire supporting cast is superb. Yes, it is a film about making a film, but in the setting chosen it works splendidly well.",Their Finest,1661275
1,SnoopyStyle,movie about movie,7/10,6 December 2017,"It's 1940 and London is under heavy bombardment. Expecting to be a secretary, Catrin Cole (Gemma Arterton) is hired by Ministry of Information to give scripts a female touch. Her 'husband' is a struggling artist with a gimpy leg from the Spanish war. She is given the real story of twin sisters Lily and Rose stealing their father's boat to go to Dunkirk. Once there, she finds the truth is different from the news story. She decides to spin half-truths to her superiors to continue the project. Tom Buckley (Sam Claflin) is her impossible head writer and Ambrose Hilliard (Bill Nighy) is an acting diva. As they rush to finish the film, the story gets changed and a relationship develops.The actors are good. The story is touching but like the fictional movie inside the movie, some artificial manipulation starts to show. It has its poignant tear-jerker fun. The big acting moment from Gemma is a half and half proposition where it feels somewhat manufactured although it is very in keeping with the concept of the movie. Gemma is a solid lead dealing with all the emotions and issues. Bill Nighy is terrific as usual. Sam Claflin transitions well. It's all very good.",Their Finest,1661275
2,bob-the-movie-man,Keep calm and keep writing,8/10,6 May 2017,"In a well-mined category, ""Their Finest"" is a World War 2 comedy/drama telling a tale I haven't seen told before: the story behind the British Ministry of Information and their drive to produce propaganda films that support morale and promote positive messages in a time of national crisis. For it is 1940 and London is under nightly attack by the Luftwaffe during the time known as ""The Blitz"". Unfortunately the Ministry is run by a bunch of toffs, and their output is laughably misaligned with the working class population, and especially the female population:  with their husbands fighting overseas, these two groups are fast becoming one and the same. For women are finding and enjoying new empowerment and freedom in being socially unshackled from the kitchen sink. Enter Catrin Cole (Gemma Arterton, ""The Girl with all the Gifts"") who is one such woman arriving to a dangerous London from South Wales to live with struggling disabled artist Ellis (Jack Huston, grandson of John Huston). Catrin, stretching the truth a little, brings a stirring 'true' tale of derring-do about the Dunkirk evacuation to the Ministry's attention. She is then employed to ""write the slop"" (the woman's dialogue) in the writing team headed by spiky Tom Buckley (Sam Claflin, ""Me Before You"").One of the stars of the film within the film is 'Uncle Frank' played by the aging but charismatic actor Ambrose Hilliard (Bill Nighy, ""Dad's Army"", ""Love Actually""). Catrin proves her worth by pouring oil on troubled waters as the army insist on the introduction of an American airman (Jake Lacy, ""Carol"") to the stressful mix. An attraction builds between Catrin and Tom, but how will the love triangle resolve itself?As you might expect if you've seen the trailer the film is, in the main, warm and funny with Gemma Arterton just gorgeously huggable as the determined young lady trying to make it in a misogynistic 40's world of work. Arterton is just the perfect ""girl next door"". But mixed in with the humour and the romantic storyline is a harsh sprinkling of the trials of war and not a little heartbreak occurs.  This is at least a 5 tissue movie. Claflin, who is having a strong year with appearances in a wide range of films, is also eminently watchable. One of his best scenes is a speech with Arterton about ""why people love the movies"", a theory that the film merrily and memorably drives a stake through the heart of!  Elsewhere Lacy is hilarious as the hapless airman with zero acting ability; Helen McCrory (""Harry Potter"") as Sophie Smith vamps it up wonderfully as the potential Polish love interest for Hilliard; Richard E Grant (""Logan"") and Jeremy Irons (""The Lion King"", ""Die Hard: with a Vengeance"") pop up in useful cameos and Eddie Marsan (""Sherlock Holmes"") is also touching as Hilliard's long-suffering agent. But it is Bill Nighy's Hilliard who carries most of the wit and humour of the film with his pompous thespian persona, basking in the dwindling glory of a much loved series of ""Inspector Lynley"" films. With his pomposity progressively warming under the thawing effect of Sophie and Catrin, you have to love him!  Bill Nighy is, well, Bill Nighy. Hugh Grant gets it (unfairly) in the neck for ""being Hugh Grant"" in every film, but this pales in comparison with Nighy's performances!  But who cares: his kooky delivery is just delightful and he is a national treasure!Slightly less convincing for me was Rachael Stirling's role as a butch ministry busybody with more than a hint of the lesbian about her.  Stirling's performance in the role is fine, but would this really have been so blatant in 1940's Britain?  This didn't really ring true for me. While the film gamely tries to pull off London in the Blitz the film's limited budget (around £25m) makes everything feel a little underpowered and 'empty':  a few hundred more extras in the Underground/Blitz scenes for example would have helped no end. However, the special effects crew do their best and the cinematography by Sebastian Blenkov (""The Riot Club"") suitably conveys the mood:  a scene where Catrin gets caught in a bomb blast outside a clothes shop is particularly moving.As with all comedy dramas, sometimes the bedfellows lie uncomfortably with each other, and a couple of plot twists: one highly predictable; one shockingly unpredictable make this a non-linear watch. This roller-coaster of a script by Gaby Chiappe, in an excellent feature film debut (she actually also has a cameo in the propaganda ""carrot film""!), undeniably adds interest and makes the film more memorable. However (I know from personal experience) that the twist did not please everyone in the audience! Despite its occasionally uneven tone, this is a really enjoyable watch (particularly for more mature audiences) and Danish director Lone Scherfig finally has a vehicle that matches the quality of her much praised Carey Mulligan vehicle ""An Education"".(For the graphical version of this review, please visit bob-the-movie- man.com.

3,subxerogravity,Good movie about people who make good movies.,8/10,10 April 2017,"It's a movie within a movie. I feel in general, a movie about movies is a good topic for a movie. People love to hear stories about how the movies works. I know personally I'm a sucker for this type of drama.Based on a book called Their Finest Hour and a Half, which I think is a better title, Their Finest stars Gemma Arterton in a movie that takes place during World War 2 in England, when women join the workforce in order keep the world going that was coming to a halt do to the Blitzkrieg. In this case Arterton's character Catrin Cole, a woman working for a newspaper that leads to an opportunity to write a screenplay for a movie.What I like about the movie is that it's a funny story about how a screenplay is created. They basically hired Catrin Cole to tell the story of the war from a women's perspective, namely the true story of a pair of twins who attempted to use their boat to help rescue soldiers in France, but the true story is not good enough propaganda to get the citizens of Britain into the cause, so she has to embellish what happen.As the writing progressed, they keep getting stopped by someone, weather it was the producer or The Secretary of War to add new things so that they can appeal to the masses, a very interesting process made hilarious by the movie.The whole film is a satire on the film industry of 1940s Great Britain that's still true today. Their Finest also has some romance in it, as Cartin becomes attracted to her fellow writer on the screenplay, Tom Buckley. The film is also a good example about how female roles in society started to shift during World War II.Bill Nighy was as fun to watch as I was told. He plays an aging actor finding his popularity is stuck on something he did years ago, and like Catin finds an opportunity within the war.Overall, I really enjoined the movie. Gemma Arterton made a really good lead actress and the movie altogether was a great story.http://cinemagardens.com",Their Finest,1661275
4,CineMuseFilms,A delightfully nostalgic period drama of movie-making and romance during the London Blitz.,8/10,24 April 2017,"Their Finest (2016) is one of several recent films that remediate women's conspicuous absence from war history. It stands tall in the war film genre, as well as in period drama and feminist film. With beautiful cinematography, it nostalgically evokes the tensions and deprivations of London in 1940. At the same time, it provides an instructive insight into the making of a war propaganda movie in the early days of film history.The two-part plot line is based on the experiences of young Welshwoman Catrin Cole (Gemma Arterton) who unexpectedly lands a movie scriptwriting job in the British Ministry of Information. The first half of Their Finest is about the planning of a movie for boosting morale and support for the war; the second is its actual filming. The thread of continuity is Catrin's relationships; first with her war-damaged artist lover Ellis Cole (Jack Huston) and then her senior scriptwriter Tom Buckley (Sam Claflin). Catrin has been hired to write ""the slops"", a term used to describe women's interests and views. In wartime, things change unexpectedly and the movie shifts from an emphasis on women, to a general rallying call to the nation, and then to an appeal to America to join the war. The casting of stars shifts from heroines to a past-his-prime actor Ambrose Hilliard (Bill Nighy) to an American fighter pilot who turns out to have appalling acting skills. By the end of Their Finest, we are watching the finished movie being screened in public having witnessed how it was made and the effect it has on the people involved.The making of a war movie within a war film is an original and clever cinematic construction. The storyboarding, casting, and filming of the movie provide self-reflexive insights into movie-making itself. This is a multi-genre film, combining war and filmmaking history, period drama and romance, but it's inaccurate to call it a comedy. Most of the humour comes from Bill Nighy's portrayal of the pompous British artistic classes and his fading light as an actor. In an otherwise well-directed film, Nighy often overshadows its star, Gemma Arterton, who is the film's beating heart and champion for women. Nighy has that rare ability to fill any space into which he walks, but this means that the film's excellent cast shine only when he is off screen.There are many reasons for liking this film, including its originality, acting and filming. It poignantly captures the fragility of life in the London Blitz with detailed attention to nostalgic sets, costumes, and mannerisms of an era. The colour palette's de-saturated tonality reflects the sombre mood of the nation and the narrative covers a lot of ground. It is ironic, however, that a film dedicated to recognising the role of women in history should be so under the comedic influence of a veteran male actor. Despite its efforts to be otherwise, this will be remembered as a Bill Nighy film. For many, that's not a bad thing.",Their Finest,1661275
5,SameirAli,Cinema in Cinema.,7/10,17 January 2017,"The story of a movie withing the movie during World War II. A lady has to be a part of the script writing for a movie.The movie is said to be a feminist comedy drama and I was lucky enough to watch the Red Carpet Premiere at the Dubai International Film Festival along with the Director (Lone Scherfig), producer and actor (Bill Nighy).Definitely a beautiful period movie with a some slight comic bits here and there, blended with heart touching sentimental scenes. Beautiful visuals; sound design and set design are wonderful. The performance of the actors are added to the quality of the movie.As the movie movies towards the cliché of a Hollywood ending, the director decides the other way. A major shocking twist.An unforgettable movie that will leave a mark in your heart. A must watch and highly recommended. #KiduMovie",Their Finest,1661275
6,Robert_duder,A very unique little film worth checking out,8/10,1 May 2017,"If there is one thing we hear constantly it's ""Hollywood is out of ideas"" and ""there is nothing original anymore"" but there is! Sometimes you just have to search for it. It has been a long time since I went for a blind movie, meaning I choose a movie and walk into it without knowing anything. So I tried that with Their Finest and once again it worked out very well for me. Their Finest was entertaining, funny, cute, unique and a great look at early Hollywood during World War 2. It has romance and strong characters and a really great female heroine. I love strong female characters and this film really drives that home huge. The biggest issue I thought with the film was the end. Everything is going truly great with the movie, the acting and the dialog and the characters and the pacing and then at a certain point it almost all falls apart. They make a bizarre change at the climax that is simply too fast and the end of the movie falls flat. If not for that this could have been an easy 9 to be honest. Still it isn't like anything else out there and it could be classified as a dark comedy/romance/drama but has something for everyone.The lovely Gemma Arterton is our hero. She is a writer and wife struggling to support her and her husband and finally gets in on the ground level of a potential writing job in WW2 Hollywood. She is great in this film. Her performance is subtle and moving and emotional and she's funny and real and very vivid and much of the film is all about her and her journey. Adding to the gravitas of the cast is the incomparable Bill Nighy who plays legendary actor Ambrose Hilliard. Nighy is amazing and her chemistry with Arterton is perfect for the film. Nighy does what he does best bringing this character to life and giving him ups and downs and very real faults and challenges but making him someone you root for and care for. Sam Claflin is Arterton's nemesis in the beginning and they forge a working relationship, friendship and eventually romance. Their relationship is a highlight of the film although I felt as though he was a tad underdeveloped making his turn in the film a little underwhelming. Jack Huston is decent in a smaller role as Arterton's husband (of sorts) He's important to her character development but not much else. The supporting cast are all really good and fit their roles well. The movie within the movie is such a huge part of the experience of Their Finest.Lone Scherfig has a lot of talent as a fairly new director. She has done a handful of things with varying degrees of success but I think her talents lie in storytelling. The film has some great scenes and a good hook but the characters are what draw you in. Arterton's journey as a writer in a ""man's world"" is the best part about this film. I think a woman directing the movie makes a big difference and impact. If you're looking for something a little offbeat and different and away from the mainstream Hollywood blockbusters, this is great and is sure to be memorable for you. It might not be mind blowing but it is well worth being watched. 8/10",Their Finest,1661275
7,jrarichards,"Well enough done, if seemingly at times a bit mixed up",8/10,29 October 2017,"Lone Scherfig's ""Their Finest"" is an enjoyable watch, of that there is little doubt, though (or even perhaps because) it features one of cinema's most-surprising plot twists. It is also - it seems to me - a little unsure of what it is really trying to achieve.Though the Director is Danish and the Producers British and American, the book is a British one from Lissa Evans, and the film itself has a very distinct Ealing Comedy-type vibe (if strongly nuanced by death and sadness).Yet at moments it seems to go beyond being ""a little film"", heading instead in more-epic directions. It is hard to know how that happens, but it somehow does...The work has a flavour of Powell and Pressburger sweeping grandeur about it, hence one wonders if the Hungarian character of Gabriel Baker played by Henry Goodman is actually meant to be Pressburger. This would fit, given that ""A Canterbury Tale"" from 1944 features a real-life American serviceman Sergeant John Sweet (the goal being to stress the links between Britain and America), just as the film within the film of ""Their Finest"" - which is being made in an earlier post-Dunkirk phase of the War - features an American pilot in the shape of Carl Lundbeck played by American Jake Lacey.So is this a film about (the pastiches, lies or bendings of the truth demanded by) propaganda film-making? Always assuming such a term can be deployed in relation to something as beautiful as ""A Canterbury Tale"", or indeed Pressburger's other gems ""A Matter of Life and Death"" and ""Colonel Blimp"", to say nothing of Olivier's exquisite version of ""Henry V""? Is ""Their Finest"" a semi-documentary in this sense? All the more since it occasionally presents, or at least alludes to, real-life wartime information films, and it does have a great deal of worthwhile comment to make about the reasons for such films to be made, and the ways in which they are made? Perhaps it is a not-entirely-funny comedy? Bill Nighy's role here would seem to suggest it is intended to be quite funny, and at times it is. But, in the end, there is too much respect for the real-life story to poke more than a hint of fun at the 1940s. Ultimately, that was ""our finest hour"", and nothing is going to change that view, or approach. But this is also apparently a film about the further chance at the advancement of women that World War II offered (just as had the First World War a couple of decades previously)? Certainly, there is huge emphasis put on this issue here - sometimes to the point of overkill; though it does, for example, allow us a joyous time with the increasingly omnipresent Helen McCrory as Sophie Smith.The biggest star here is probably ""the War Effort"", that grand and noble purpose occupying such a high proportion of the wartime population of my country, who got on with something (whatever it might be) as houses and streets continued to be demolished by bombing in a pretty random kind of manner (as ""Their Finest"" in fact indicates rather beautifully).Nevertheless, not quite everyone here is (or really was) a hero, as this piece makes clear with its ambiguous and enigmatic character of Ellis Cole, played by Jack Huston. Cole looks like he might not really be ""doing his bit"", yet here too there is nuancing, as he clearly had been prepared to step up a few years previously, fighting (presumably for the left) in the Spanish Civil War. Likewise, a World War I veteran alluded to in the film is unable to adjust to the peacetime world and directs his PTSD at the persecution of his twin daughters.My somewhat failing (or flailing) attempt to sum up a few of the threads in this film does much to indicate my state of mind about a piece that seems to slip between several categories without fully emerging into any one of them.Of course, that is by no means a sign that there is nothing worth watching here, and all the more so as Gemma Arterton and Sam Claflin both do well here in a stiff-upper-lip ""Brief Encounter"" kind of way.So then this is a romantic film as well? There are also pretty compelling cameos by Jeremy Irons, Richard E. Grant and Eddie Marsan to enjoy, and at least a couple of locations so tranquil and beautiful that it reminds us again that Britain was fighting to defend itself and what it held dear, as well as to destroy somebody else's hideous evil...",Their Finest,1661275
8,jadepietro,Their Second Bests,8/10,22 April 2017,"(RATING: ☆☆☆☆ out of 5 ) GRADE: B THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A well acted and thoroughly entertaining war story.SYNOPSIS: During World War II, a secretary joins a movie crew to make a propaganda film about Dunkirk.JIM'S REVIEW: Let's face it, with a film entitled Their Finest, the bar is set mighty high. And while the film is not the finest film you will ever see, it is still a fine film worthy of one's attention. It boasts very good acting, a literate script, strong direction and period details, and an intriguing premise. Not all of these elements works as a whole, but the parts are genuinely compelling.￼A movie production crew wants to tell ""a story that will inspire the world"". These are desperate times, in 1940 war-town London. Public spirits is low and the government wants the entertainment industry to provide a more positive uplift to the doom and glory that is an everyday occurrence for the English folk by creating a propaganda film to unite the country. Thrown into the mix of creative souls is Catrin Cole (Gemma Arterton), a former secretary hired as a screenwriter to bring a more authentic woman's point of view. It is there she meets Tom Buckley (Sam Clafin), a cynical talented writer, although she is involved with Ellis Cole (Jack Huston) an egotistical artist. But duty calls and Catrin has found her calling, both professionally and personally.Also on the set is Phyl Moore (Rachael Stirling), a tough-as-nails Rosalind Russell type, Carl Lundbeck (Jake Lacy), an American war hero turned actor ala Audie Murphy (with even less talent), and a washed-up matinée idol, Ambrose Hilliard (the reliable Bill Nighy). Adding more prestige to this movie-within-a-movie are such steadfast British stars as Richard E. Grant, Jeremy Irons, and Eddie Marsan, although their contributions are mere cameo walk-ons. All of the actors are superb, even if some of their roles are underwritten.￼The film, when always entertaining, is in need of a few rewrites. Some scenes seems out of place and supporting characters lack depth. It feels as if there are two films vying for the moviegoer's attention: the down-on-his-luck aging actor in search of a hit, and a tender love story about two writers who find each other. While both are interesting and acted to maximum effect, the plot rarely gels, especially with some contrivances toward the third act. The overall mood varies from comedic moments to pure melodrama and then serious wartime drama. Lone Scherfig solidly directs but she doesn't find the right tone and Gaby Chaippe's screenplay needs to show more realism and edginess rather than seeing the story through rose-colored glasses.￼Still, the chemistry between the ill-matched lovers is palpable and Ms. Arterton and Mr. Clafin make a charming duo. Add the self-effacing subtlety of Mr. Nighy to add a taste of the bittersweet and Their Finest is a refreshing change of pace, especially from the usual dregs of the pre-summer movie season.",Their Finest,1661275
9,steerpike_2002,Charming wartime movie-within-movie,7/10,3 May 2017,"""Their Finest"" is a clever, charming and funny movie from Danish director Lone Scherfig. Adding to her most well-known films to date, ""An Education"" and ""The Riot Club"", it is clear that Scherfig is a true Anglophile at heart, as this is as British as it comes. The film tells the story of Catrin Cole (Gemma Arterton), a Welsh secretary in London at the height of the Blitz who finds herself on the writing staff of a propaganda film about the Dunkirk evacuation. Though married to a struggling artist (Jack Huston), feelings grow between Catrin and fellow writer Buckley (Sam Claflin) as they struggle to make ""The Nancy Starling"" a film worthy of raising the nation's spirits.One of the strengths of ""Their Finest"" is its glorious sense of place and time. The locations and production design provide a real asset. The daily threat of the Blitz is rightly given sufficient screen time to feel like an ever-present menace, while wartime London and an idyllic Cornish coast are well realised.""Their Finest"" is at its best when the the lines between the movie we are watching and the movie being produced on screen are blurred. We see the characters and plot of ""The Nancy Starling"" evolve within Catrin's mind in a series of comic scenes which give Bill Nighy's character, ageing actor Ambrose Hilliard, some of his best moments. In one particularly inspired moment, the continuation of a real conversation between the romantic pair is imagined in the same visual style of the on-screen movie. The writers and director clearly had a lot of fun with these ideas and their execution is spot on. The creators' love of cinema is realised in a way only possible in a film about film-making and film-watching. The emotions of an audience watching ""The Nancy Starling"" in the film clearly capture the joy the writers and director take from cinema in general, and it's very infectious! Arterton plays the lead role very capably, creating a likable protagonist. Among the most memorable performances, Bill Nighy plays himself very well (it's difficult to imagine who could have played him better), and Rachael Stirling shines but is sadly underused. Jake Lacy is also entertaining as the square-jawed American who turns out to be a terrible actor. The film possibly suffers from the distracting addition of star cameos (Jeremy Irons popping up here for a single scene), a fault I find particularly noticeable in British films of this style.The key fault for me was that the film seemed unsure which of its two main plot-lines, the making of ""The Nancy Starling"" and the romance between Catrin and Buckley, should take centre-stage. Developing both meant that the beginning and the end of the film suffered. Initially the film needed to introduce lots of only partially related themes and concepts, which made the opening scenes feel artificially and dissatisfyingly forced together. The need to conclude both threads produced more than a few false endings which certainly made the film feel its length. The competition between story-lines also meant that some of the supporting characters, particularly Jack Huston's suffering artist, did not receive the attention they needed to give enough weight to their plot contributions. Even Buckley, one of the key players, didn't seem quite fleshed out enough, though this is not helped by the poor chemistry between Sam Claflin and Gemma Arterton.At its best though, ""Their Finest"" is a wonderful send-up of propaganda movie-making of the 1940s and a worthy war film in its own right.",Their Finest,1661275
10,brankovranjkovic,"Funny, entertaining, charming.",8/10,22 April 2017,"This is a BBC Films Production, a slow burning humorous (but not a comedy) WW2 wartime drama. Gemma Arterton gives one of her best, and completely convincing, performances. Her character lands a job at the Ministry of Information where she plays a script writer. Bill Nighy provides the most essential contribution, he plays a fading matinée star and delivers almost all the humour and best lines. The Ministry are making short morale boosting films. Their latest production is about the Battle of Dunkirk, this time they want to emphasise a feminine perspective. You really want their film to be a success (which it is!) - Some scenes would make fabulous atmospheric still images.Essentially this is a film inside a film and is a joy to watch.",Their Finest,1661275

Morale is low and the British Ministry of Information sets about producing propaganda films to lift spirits. A secretary, Catrin Cole, joins the Ministry as a junior writer and is soon thrust into the production of a major film.This film looked interesting, set during the nadir of war from a British perspective and focusing on the home front, especially the improvement of morale through movie making. An unexplored yet intriguing subject. Plus, the film stars Gemma Arterton, so what's not to like?Well, it's not bad but it's not good either. Generally bland with enough good moments to sustain it. The plot never comes alive, the characters are not that engaging, the film just seems to shuffle along. Catrin Cole's story arc has some substance, and Gemma Arterton puts in a solid performance as her, but even that is fairly predictable.Ultimately, I wish I could watch the film within the film - the propaganda movie that was produced in the film - rather than this film.

This morphs into screenwriting an inspirational movie about the role of women in the Dunkirk evacuation. But personal relationships raise complications...This movie successfully weaves together elements of romance, drama, comedy, feminism, war, and the British class system (among others) in telling Mrs Cole's story. In doing so, it throws in two story twists, one of them major. They don't exactly turn the story on its head, but they do mean it doesn't follow the course one expects.Gemma Arterton is good as Mrs Cole, and Sam Claflin pleases as her boss. But everyone will love Bill Nighy as egotistical Actor Ambrose.I feared that this would be a feminist tract, but that particular message is sold subtly: it's there, but the film doesn't beat you over the head with it. And you are engaged by the characters, so the message is welcomed.I enjoyed this, and so did the rest of the audience, all of whom were over 60.",Their Finest,1661275

14,TheLittleSongbird,Playing a part for freedom,7/10,20 November 2019,"Have not seen enough of Lone Scherfig's work to share my opinion of her as a director, but of the little seen 'An Education' is an excellent film. The premise for 'Their Finest' also fascinated, perhaps not the most original of ones but very clever and that it was set during one of Britain's toughest periods in history added to the intrigue. And then there was the cast, filled with immensely talented actors with Bill Nighy being the biggest attraction in a role that sounded on paper perfect for him.While it is not my definition of a great film, or one devoid of flaws, 'Their Finest' still managed to be a pleasant diversion with much to like. The pace and a couple of aspects of the story don't always work and one performance and some of the chemistry didn't do much for me, but mostly it's well made, acted and has gentle amusement and heart. It won't work for all tastebuds, but it is easy to see why people have found and will find appeal in it.Beginning with what 'Their Finest' doesn't quite work in, Sam Claflin is for my tastes rather bland and looked a bit awkward. He doesn't have much chemistry with Gemma Arterton, or at least one that feels natural or compelling.The romantic element felt underdeveloped and shoehorned, not much to it really. Some of the film drags, particularly towards the end.However, there is a lot good. 'Their Finest' is beautifully and atmospherically shot and the recreation of the period is elegant while not too glossy (one does get a sense that it was a cruel time for Britain), true to it too. Rachel Portman brings her usual sumptuous orchestration and romantic yet never syrupy style to a music score that matches the pleasant tone of the story well. The script is gently amusing and charming and while the story execution is less than perfect it doesn't waste the film within a film premise, which is cleverly, entertainingly and affectionately handled.Ending did leave me very misty-eyed, while the justice and sacrifice themes add depth and didn't feel tacked on. The performances mostly are fine, with the top honours going to the absolute joy that is Nighy and true to what it sounded on paper the character fitted him like a glove. Arterton is bewitching in the lead role too, and Rachel Stirling is a delight. There is even a deliciously theatrical Secretary of War courtesy from Jeremy Irons.In conclusion, not great but pleasant. 7/10",Their Finest,1661275
15,bbewnylorac,Disappointing. Not their finest effort.,5/10,28 April 2017,"The best that can be said about the film Their Finest - about WWII propaganda films - is that I didn't walk out. Although I was sorely tempted to, about halfway through, when I realised how tedious and sluggish the story and script was. It's set in London during the Blitz, but where's the tension? Where's the drama? The locations and lighting and sets are nicely presented, yet the plot and dialogue have the quality of a polite suburban play. The whole movie doesn't hang together as a solid piece of work. Gemma Arterton gives a heartfelt go at her role as budding scriptwriter Catherine Cole. But the actor who plays her poor artist husband doesn't have much chemistry with her, and doesn't get much, of interest, to say or do. Jack Huston, as Catherine's real love interest, fellow writer Ellis, is smart, and also attempts to give his role some depth. As the faded film star who acts in the propaganda films, Bill Nighy does his mildly amusing Bill Nighy schtick. You can imagine him as a former matinée idol. It's just that overall in Their Finest, not enough happens to make you really love, or identify with, the characters or the storyline. Quite a few times, the horribly random nature of the bombing of London is depicted, but it's as if someone had read the script and gone, OK, we need something dramatic to happen about now, how about we kill off character X? It seems pretty bloodless and meaningless. The film purports to be a comedy, but there isn't much even gentle humour. Maybe this is the wrong film to watch about the Blitz. Maybe one day someone will make an incredibly moving and engrossing film with some of the elements depicted here. For example, how your best friend could be killed in an instant while crossing the road. Meanwhile, I think in order to enjoy Their Finest, you would have to be a very undemanding viewer.",Their Finest,1661275
16,Hellmant,It's funny that this came out the same summer as Christopher Nolan's film!,8/10,11 August 2017,"'THEIR FINEST': Four Stars (Out of Five) A British comedy-drama about the passionate attempts of the British Ministry of Information's film team, in 1940 London, to make a movie about the Dunkirk evacuation, in order to boost morale during the Battle of Britain and the London Blitz. It was directed by Lone Scherfig, and it was written by Gabby Chiappe; the script was based on the 2009 novel 'Their Finest Hour and a Half', by Lissa Evans. The film stars Gemma Arterton, Sam Claflin, Bill Nighy, Jack Huston, Jake Lacy, Helen McCrory, Eddie Marsan, Rachael Stirling, Paul Ritter, Richard E. Grant and Jeremy Irons. It's received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it was also a modest hit at the Box Office as well. I enjoyed it too.In 1940 London, Catrin Cole (Arterton) is offered a well paying screen writing job at the Ministry of Information. Her husband Ellis Cole (Huston) is an unemployed war artist who feels threatened that Catrin is now the only wage earner (and he tries to persuade her to quit her new job multiple times). Catrin passionately continues her new work adventure though, and she joins a writing team tasked with scripting a film about the Dunkirk evacuation. The movie they're writing is intended to boost the public's morale, but several complications arise in bringing the film to the big screen. Catrin always admirably persists, and a love-hate relationship develops between her and another writer (Claflin).The film is well made and inspiring (I think probably especially for women). Arterton is really good in the lead role, and the supporting cast is filled with fun supporting performances (especially Nighy). It's also funny that this film (about the Dunkirk evacuation) was released the same summer as director Christopher Nolan's much darker (and bigger budgeted) war movie (called 'DUNKIRK'). It's interesting to see two different genre's takes on the same major dramatic event in history.Watch an episode of our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://vimeo.com/230044658",Their Finest,1661275
17,Pjtaylor-96-138044,A perfectly fine film that's generally enjoyable but ultimately not all that captivating.,6/10,15 May 2018,"'Their Finest (2017' is certainly too long, with its two-hour run-time honestly feeling more like three-hours. It also isn't a particularly compelling film, it doesn't 'grab' you and keep you captivated throughout. It is a perfectly decent picture, though. It's well made and generally enjoyable, despite its structural and pacing issues. It's just that it is only entertaining up to a point because it is essentially a passive experience, lacking the connection required to make you truly care. 6/10

Some actors such as Bill Nighy and Jeremy Irons manage to shine.Gemma Arterton plays Catrin employed by the Ministry of Information during World War 2 to make propaganda films and help out with women's dialogue.Eventually the film unit are making a technicolour film on the evacuation of Dunkirk when it becomes a film about a film. Catrin shines as a writer earning respect from the other men in the unit and even finds love.Although wonderfully shot, it was neither comic or dramatic but just hackneyed.

19,Horst_In_Translation,"Sometimes a fine movie, but never really the finest of 2017 or anything",6/10,29 July 2017,"""Their Finest"" is a British /Swedish (for whatever reason) movie that premiered last year (2016) and it is the most recent directorial effort by Lone Scherfig, a filmmaker that I enjoyed some of her career efforts. This time she is not credited as the writer, but Gaby Chiappe wrote her very first screenplay here by adapting Lissa Evans' novel. Chiappe still has been prolific in other fields looking at her body of work. The film comes pretty close to the 2-hour mark and almost all scenes involve former Bond girl Gemma Arterton's character as she is put in charge of writing a screen play that will emphasize the importance of the female gender during the dark days of World War II. So yes, it is somewhat of another war film, but the ""film on film"" aspect that is crucial from start to finish is a really interesting basis for the story here and actually adds something new that we have (or I have) not yet seen in these hundreds of films centering on World War II. It is good that it is not about the military or about politics, but about the individual fate of Miss Catrin Cole.I have one major criticism though and this refers to the romance component. The way it was handled here I could have done without it completely. The low point was probably the cheating scene that felt like taken out of some embarrassing telenovela. I am positive Miss Cole would have hated it too. So it was almost a revelation near the very end when the guy gets killed, even if it broke her heart. It also made a nice reference back to the unpredictable cruelties of war that we had almost forgotten by that point. Actually in reference to that death scene, I liked the previous comment by the older writer about how war will get every young man eventually and it certainly is a bit of a forecast on what might happen. Back to Arterton, she had some good moments really, especially towards the end, and proves she is lead actress material and more than a (truly)stunning face with an equally stunning body. She was definitely one of the better components from this film and yet I don't think this is close to the best I have seen from her, which may also not only be because of her performance, but also because of the material really. The romance plot was cheesy and stupid and should have been left out (almost) in its entirety. I'd have been fine with her returning to her man eventually or the other way around perhaps. Also the connections between the film characters' fates in terms of romance and Arterton's character weren't functioning either. Without these and maybe some of the emancipation scenes (like salary equality early on), it could have been a really great movie, perhaps one of the finest of 2017.But yeah like I said these shortcomings may have had to do with the writer's inexperience. For a rookie script, it was nonetheless quite convincing. Every time the movie is about the movie within, it truly shines. This is also thanks to Bill Nighy who has great material to work with in here and also makes it work excellently, the serious as well as the (more frequent) comedic scenes. He proves again that basically nothing has changed in the last 15 years or more and that he is one of the finest supporting actors out there. Just give the man an Oscar nomination already. I doubt he'll get it for his turn here, but it would be very much deserving as with considerably less screen time, he is at least as memorable in here as Arterton and totally elevates the overall material. This film has flaws here and there, but the positive is still definitely more frequent than the negative. Go watch it and I hope you won't be disappointed and enjoy it as much as I did. The lesser known recent Dunkirk movie, but perhaps the better even.",Their Finest,1661275
20,begob,Heartening romance lets in the light and the dark,8/10,23 January 2018,"During the Blitz a struggling copywriter gets a job to help write a propaganda film about the Dunkirk evacuation, but the men in her life are not always helpful ...Lovely period drama, with a good balance of humour and hurt, and well produced all round. It's a long run time, but the pace is good, and the location switches keep the interest up. The story is love in a time of war, and there are several ups and downs amid the grim cruelty, with the added irony of the characters suffering the screenwriter's trick that they themselves apply: keep upping the ante until they have no choice but to resolve their predicament. There's also amusement in the camera trickery.One complaint: there is a brutal twist, which does tie in with the theme of life not being structured like stories, but I am bewildered by it and feel it wasn't handled right.Some of the humour comes from the chemistry between the screenwriters, but mostly from the crew on set down by the seaside, where Bill Nighy is on good form. The lead actress shows how good she is with quality material, and the cast delivers a solid performance. I particularly liked the scene with the twin sisters in Devon.Overall: Heartening romance that lets in the light and the dark.",Their Finest,1661275
21,lee_eisenberg,everybody loves Dunkirk,9/10,16 January 2018,"There have been countless movies about WWII. Most of them focus on the men in uniform, out in combat. Less gets shown of the women behind the scenes. Lone Scherfig's ""Their Finest"" focuses on a woman writing scripts for short information films in the United Kingdom. One of the things that I noticed is that it takes place around the time of the Dunkirk evacuation, recently depicted in Christopher Nolan's movie. That seems to be a popular topic these days, as is Winston Churchill (he's gotten depicted in several productions over the past year).It's not a masterpiece, but it pulls no punches in showing the horror of the air raids on London by Nazi forces, and the characters are developed enough so that the viewer cares about them. Gemma Arterton turns in a fine performance in the lead role, with good support from the rest of the cast (including Bill Nighy and Eddie Marsan).* I recommend the movie.*Incidentally, right after watching this I watched ""The Limehouse Golem"", in which those two also starred.",Their Finest,1661275
22,akicork,Well worth watching,9/10,6 September 2019,"This is an echo down the years. I see the scenes with the people huddled in the tube stations, and I now understand more of my mother's story. At her ninetieth birthday party she wore a cardigan I had seen many times before, and on that occasion she told me that she had crocheted it (during the Blitz) in the tube to take her mind off the bombs dropping. I had thought she was just worried about the risk travelling to and from work, but she was actually down in a tube station while the attack fell, sitting, waiting, hoping not to be hit.
This is not a comedy, but a drama with deft comic touches, and seriously worth watching. A film about making films that has caught aspects of the industry as relevant today as they were eighty years ago and has also brought me to a realisation of the atmosphere of the Blitz I have not experienced before.
The main personal plot thread, as I see it, is Catrin's (Gemma Arterton) journey from a naïve country girl looking for a secretarial post and reliant on ""A Man"", through betrayal by one and the death of another, to the crucial scene in the cinema when a woman tells her that she has seen the film, Catrin's work, five times, and a soldier tells her that the more often he sees it, the more he gets out of it. There are also echoes in the filmscript of Catrin's own need to see happy endings. As the film closes we see her getting to grips with her typewriter, in the realisation that this is where she is meant to be.
The DVD packaging headline says ""Bill Nighy is Brilliantly Funny"" and so he probably is, but for me his dramatic high point is in his film persona as Uncle Frank, dying after the attack on his boat as he evacuates soldiers from Dunkirk. He also gets to present as a supportive father figure, both to Catrin and the overall crew. His solid presence is perhaps the anchor of the film.",Their Finest,1661275

26,rabbitmoon,So light and theatrical its almost pointless,3/10,22 April 2017,"Their Finest is absolutely one of those ""nice"" films that might pass the time on a long-haul flight where your mind is distracted, or something an old couple might enjoy on a Sunday afternoon whilst cleaning up after a roast dinner. For that kind of film, it does it's job well. That's OK if its a ""Me Vs You"" type of whimsy, but Their Finest could have been so much more. It felt like it would have some dignity, purpose and backbone, like The King's Speech, Hidden Figures or Suffragette, but sadly it didn't. Their Finest could have been about so much - a woman's struggle for recognition, the influence and responsibilities of propaganda and journalism, how the pressure and fear of war could drive creativity, art vs craft in terms of sacrificing truth or expression for the greater good of what a demoralised audience needs. But it didn't have the confidence to really tackle anything at all - it just bumbles along with a phoney theatricality and those typically self-conscious witticisms that British films seem to pride themselves on. Its ironic that the film they're making ends up seeming so much more emotional than the film we're seeing. A huge flaw is the character/love interest played by Sam Caflin, whose acting is unbelievably wooden in all his films. A role that a younger Ewan McGregor, Hugh Grant or Tom Hollander would have nailed without thinking, but here it just falls flat. How the romance is handled, and ultimately resolved, is almost satirical for how ill-judged it is. Gemma Arterton just about manages, but I was craving some nuance and actual character depth. One saving grace is Bill Nighy who thankfully does know how to portray a character, even if its the same one he's always known for. I can't help but feel that his performance and comedy saves the film from being exposed for its complete lack of purpose or point. Their Finest really is a disappointing hack film aimed at the Sunday afternoon crowd, that no one will remember in less than two years.",Their Finest,1661275
27,tigerfish50,Marooned in Mediocrity,1/10,6 June 2017,"'Their Finest' is neither fish nor fowl, never making up its mind whether it wants to be a satirical comedy, love story or feminist tract. In more skillful hands, perhaps it could have been all of these, but director Scherfig steers a muddled course from the beginning, and the project remains marooned in the doldrums throughout the proceedings.The story tells how a British production team and film crew make a wartime movie about the Dunkirk evacuation which is intended to raise domestic spirits and impress Americans. As far as the comedic aspect is concerned, there are some scattered breezes of ho-hum humor, but they aren't sufficient to raise the entertainment barometer above the level of a mildly sophisticated sit-com. Meanwhile, the romantic element seems like a tacked-on afterthought, along with the sub-plot of female empowerment. Arterton, Nighy and the rest of the cast do their best with the material, but they are always fighting a losing battle against the soporific screenplay and dull direction.

28,RMurray847,"Charming & enjoyable film. Also happens to be a delightful companion-piece to DUNKIRK, believe it or not.",8/10,8 January 2021,"THEIR FINEST is certainly a film that I nearly missed. It played at a local theater for two weeks. I had never heard of it...and frankly, if I hadn't seen the poster of it and noticed Bill Nighy, I might never have been aware of its existence. I am SO glad that I researched and found out a little more, because it is a delightful film.It tells the story of the film making industry in Britain during WWII. These artists and craftspeople are employed by the government to produce films to bolster morale. Yes, propaganda. By chance, Gemma Arterton finds out that the industry is struggling with writing convincing, compelling female characters (and women are likely a larger proportion of the audience for these films, as many of the men are off fighting). She has some natural writing skills and manages to get hired (for a lot less money and no credit). She needs the job, because her ""husband"" (see the movie to understand the quotes) is an unemployed and probably unemployable painter.The film amusingly portrays her travails, as she tries to fit in and be taken seriously. She develops an interest in one of her colleagues (Sam Ciaflin) and also manages to ingratiate herself, eventually, with Bill Nighy, who plays a former movie star who just can't understand that he's no longer a leading man! The film has a light touch, but the seriousness of the war and the work they are doing is not overlooked. Eventually, they are assigned a ""big budget"" movie...they are to make a film about two sisters who were heroes during Dunkirk. This requires some locations shooting, and more work than usual. The stress mounts, as the story is clearly of great importance (and the truth needs to be bent just so).So the film has the light tone of an older British comedy, with some modern flairs. It is romantic, funny, sad, engaging and interesting. The scenes of making the movie are often laugh-out-loud funny. It's not a masterpiece, but its entirely engaging and enjoyable, and tells an unusual story that shouldn't get lost to history. Gemma Arterton is very charming and shows a lightness that I've not seen in her before. Bill Nighy is, of course, the epitome of droll. He just doesn't let audiences down when it comes to comedy. The rest of the cast is also quite enjoyable, with the exception of Ciaflin, who just isn't a great actor. He has a certain level of charm...but lacks subtlety and range.In this movie-season, I would highly recommend this film as a follow-up to the deservedly acclaimed DUNKIRK. That film is gripping, tense, loud and exciting. See it, then wait about three days and watch THEIR FINEST. It's an unlikely companion-piece, but also just right, I think. But regardless, I highly recommend the film.",Their Finest,1661275
29,writers_reign,1066 And All That,5/10,21 April 2017,"This is a fairly easy to digest satire on the Civil Service - as personified by the Ministry of Information - in wartime. Shortly after the start of the second world war the mandarins decide that propaganda via cinema is the way to go and accordingly charge a group of scriptwriters to come up with a story that will inspire moviegoers nationwide to lend a hand on the land and be mindful the loose lips sink ships and generally keep calm and carry on. It then occurs to someone that a female perspective may help and so Gemma Arterton is brought in to bulk up the script. From then on it's mainly a case of Ministry intervention in an effort to please everyone, not least the Americans who are, at this stage, America Firsters. It's pleasant enough and largely painless with a dash of nostalgia for those who would seek it.",Their Finest,1661275

But just how were those films made, and how could they affect the morale of the general public who viewed them? That question is the focus of ""Their Finest."" This film has plenty to like about it and is well-intentioned, but unfortunately ends up fairly flat.The film focuses on the production of a British propaganda film about the evacuation of Dunkirk, France that is intended to strengthen public morale. Its performances are a mixed bag--Gemma Arterton gives a charismatic lead performance, although her character feels like a caricature; while Bill Nighy's acting talents are sadly put to waste here. The script is generally well-written throughout, and the film's depiction of filmmaking processes is often interesting and enthralling. However, such depiction and writing can't stop the film from nearly drowning in a sea of clichés that resemble many historical dramas.Ultimately, there are definitely good things about ""Their Finest,"" but the film has considerable flaws as well. It's not bad by any means, but it's not that good either. Unless you are a huge fan of the cast, I would likely recommend waiting to rent it. 6/10",Their Finest,1661275

33,timdalton007,Finding Light In Darkness,9/10,19 April 2020,"There's been a lot of films made about the Second World War over the years. Most of them have been what would be in the category of war movies exploring battles and generals, like last year's Midway, Sink the Bismarck, or the 1970 Oscar-winning Patton. Occasionally, however, some films offer a different perspective, exploring in fiction portions of the war, especially on the home fronts, that doesn't receive much attention. Their Finest, based on a novel by Lissa Evans, looks at the creative side of the home front and what it took to make a cinematic effort in a nation under literal siege.First and foremost, this is a film about a film. Specifically, it's a fictional film about a fictional film. Something which, in itself, is rather interesting since it is also looking back on a very particular era in the history of British cinema, one which viewers are a witness to through the eyes of a young Welsh woman named Catrin Cole. This secretary turned inadvertent screenwriter becomes our guide as she finds herself involved in the creation of a film about two sisters and the Dunkirk evacuation as the Blitz rains down on the streets of London. One which might help to inspire an already war-weary people and which, as the Ministry ends up demanding, have an American in it to boot. It's an interesting way of looking not just at an interesting moment in British film history but also an intriguing moment of British history in general, something which works in the film's favor.It's also a film blessed with a first-rate cast. Leading it is Gemma Arterton as the Welsh secretary turned scriptwriter, a role that highlights her charm and inner-strength, even while allowing her moments of self-doubt and vulnerability. Sam Claflin plays Tom Buckley, her cynical screenwriting colleague, and the chemistry between the pair is palpable, to say the least. Rounding off the lead cast is a scene-stealing Bill Nighy as fading matinee idol Ambrose Hilliard. The supporting cast, likewise, is well cast from Richard E Grant as a Ministry of Information bureaucrat, Rachel Stirling as a Ministry executive overseeing the film, Jake Lacey as the token American, and even a cameo by Jeremy Irons. It's a first-rate cast and one that director Lone Scherfig puts to fine use.Their Finest also features some superb production values. Wartime Britain, from Blitz London to the coastal Devon, are recreated in their 1940s glory through a combination of location filming and the production design of Alice Normington. The costume work by Charlotte Walter likewise helps to sell the recreation of the period. More than recreating Britain at war, they also recreate a British film industry dealing with it, with viewers seeing filmmaking circa 1940 recreated, including a humorous scene where Nighy's Hilliard crashes a matte shot in progress. There's also a warmth to be found in the cinematography of Sebastian Blenkov and especially from the score by Rachel Portman, a warmth which finds itself in stark contrast when the film finds itself going into gray London days or moments of proverbial (if not literal) darkness. True, some of the London scenes seem oddly devoid of people, revealing perhaps limits of the budget to recreate the period, but when things work, they work.What stands out about Their Finest, as much as its cast and how well made it is, is its tone. In some ways, this is something of a wartime romantic comedy, one that focuses on Arterton's Cole. In other ways, it's a dramedy about the making of a movie in extraordinary times. Certainly, the warmth in its performances and those aspects I mentioned above, offer up evidence for that. To say that was all the film had would do it a disservice. Indeed, some of the twists along the way, and a major one toward the end, offer up proof that what screenwriter Gaby Chiappe and director Scherfig had in mind wasn't to produce a predictable genre piece. Instead, the movie becomes an exploration, on the national and personal level, of trying to make art in dark times, in finding hope when none seems apparent. It's something that helps elevate the finished film even more because, to its credit, it has something to say.If you're looking for an interesting way of looking at the Second World War homefront, Their Finest is the movie for you. If you're looking for one about filmmaking in days gone by, then Their Finest is likewise a movie for you. If you're looking for hope in dark times, and frankly who isn't these days, then it is also a movie for you. Because if anything will make you laugh and feel better for a couple of hours, it'll be sitting down for two hours and watching the cast and filmmakers put on Their Finest for you.",Their Finest,1661275
34,PipAndSqueak,Misses target by a mile,5/10,23 April 2017,"So, here we have a production clearly in the 'market for older film goers'. Give 'em a bit of nostalgia and a few pretty people to look at. No rude words, just a hint of sex and, if you can get away with it, some bare flesh. Make a couple of historical references, use some old news reel, Bingo, it has to be a hit! Or, so seems to be the thinking. This film, though, is a massive dud. We have a crowd of indistinguishable characters making heavy work out of a school boy story idea using Wikipedia for fact checking. Get this, ye olde Britons were known for their 'bad' teeth and ye olde Yanks for their 'brilliant' teeth. This 'knowledge' is directly referenced in this film but, those of us who know what is being referenced in the fact, can't spot a single instance of the crooked toothed amongst any of the actors. So, how does the straight toothed American stand out???? Where are the short back and sides and Brilliantined male hair styles? We see these errors because the story supposedly being told in this production is so off and unconvincing there is nothing more to do as you twiddle your thumbs waiting for the whole damn thing to come to an end. One final quibble, Staffordshire bull terriers were not and are not associated with Londoners during the war...its like having a gorilla dancing in the foreground in psychology tests.

35,lavatch,Flickers of Hope,6/10,11 July 2017,"""Flickers of Hope"" is the title of the bonus segment of the DVD version of ""Their Finest."" That expression gets at the heart of one of the most courageous moments in the history of the twentieth century: the courage and tenacity of ordinary citizens during the Battle of Britain. Winston Churchill's patriotic speech in 1940 concluded with the immortal words, ""If the British Empire and its Commonwealth last for a thousand years, men will still say, This was their finest hour."" The flickers of hope in this film demonstrate exactly what Churchill had in mind.The so-called Miracle of Dunkirk was the massive evacuation of 338,000 soldiers from Norther Europe to England during the German invasion of France in World War II. 700 vessels were spontaneously enlisted for the rescue mission. The term miracle is a misnomer because of Hitler's monumental blunder in allowing the vulnerable allied forces to escape after the Blitzkrieg had moved through Belgium and into France, mowing down the forces along the way.""Their Finest"" is a fictional story of the making of propaganda film about the Dunkirk evaluation. The focus is on a female screenwriter who interviews two young women who assisted in the evacuation. Catrin Cole is the writer who pads and embellishes the story of the twins in order to create a ""feel good"" experience during the Battle of Britain.The most interesting character relationship is that of Catrin and Tom Buckley, her fellow screenwriter. Their chemistry is good in their working rhythms, and their budding romantic relationship is effectively portrayed by the two performers.A limitation of the film was its length. The story was slow in unfolding with too many scenes where the characters were pecking away at their typewriters. There were also too many false endings. A good rule of thumb is to develop one strong ending, not three, four, or five mediocre ones.This film was based on Lissa Evans's novel entitled ""Their Finest Hour and a Half."" The filmmakers should have taken their cue from the novelist and kept this film at a length of 90 minutes. It would have been a better film with compression and focus.",Their Finest,1661275
36,orlando-somera,Great movie to see after Gary Oldham's Darkest Hour,8/10,14 February 2018,"These two films revolve around the near disaster of Dunkirk and though Darkest Hour may be the superior film, Their Finest is just as blessed with wonderful acting, especially that of Gemma Arterton and Bill Nighy. For my wife Their Finest was the superior film as it tugged at her heart strings and centered around an impressive female lead, Ms Arterton as Catrin Cole, who in the story stumbles into a job as a screenwriter during WW2. She turns out to be quite good at writing 'slop' as her cowriter, Sam Claflin as Tom Buckley, refers to the female dialog and other 'filling' in a screenplay. It turns out that if a movie is to play authentic and optimistic as required by the War Department, you need a woman's touch. And in fact many mildly feminist points are made in this story.All in all a good movie to rent as DVD.

37,ayoreinf,Not every movie with a sense of humor is a Comedy,9/10,28 May 2017,"People coming to see this movie, expecting a comedy, are bound to be disappointed. Even if they did notice that it was classified as a comedy drama. Comedy -Drama is a non term, it usually signifies a drama through which the director and writer demonstrated a sense of humor. Well, I'll repeat what I stated in the title: not every movie with a sense of humor is a comedy. Life has funny moments even when life aren't funny, as this film demonstrates more than once: think of the bomb and the window mannequins scene, and you'll see my point. It started with a smile, but it wasn't funny at all.What matters with this movie is that it rings true, all the way through. So true, that I had to conduct a research about the production of the film depicted in it. It never happened. They did shoot propaganda films in Britain, during WWII, they even shot war stories meant to uplift the moral of the people, but this movie was never made. And still, the story itself, is ""based on hundreds of true stories"", as they say in the film. So that's one point I had to make. Continuing with the same theme, as every movie that deals with movie making does, it also tells us some very important things about movie making, and about the difference between movies and real life. I'm not going to repeat these points, it would mean adding spoilers - I don't do spoilers.Last point I really mast mention - the actors are all simply superb, and if Gemma Arterton shines brighter than everyone else on screen, it's simply because the film is actually about her. It's actually the story of the character she portrays. But they're all brilliant here. And if you don't expect comedy when you arrive at the cinema, you'll notice it too.",Their Finest,1661275
38,maurice_yacowar,Typist becomes screenwriter in Blitzed London,9/10,23 April 2017,"The title alludes to Britain's Finest Hour, Churchill's term for the nation's valour and heroism in surviving the Nazis' bombing during WW II. But the term applies to two other emerging forces as well.One is The Movies, as the British government turned to film for the propagandist power the Nazis had already mobilized. This film shows the Brits developing an emotional feature film that will boost the besieged citizenry's morale and also help to draw America out of its isolationism to support her. The second is the emergence of women as an assertive social and professional force. With the young men away at war or already killed, older men and women young and old got the opportunity to assume new responsibilities. They got the chance to prove themselves. As Phyl warns Catrin Cole, the men are ""afraid they won't be able to put us back in the box when this is over, and it makes them belligerent."" Modern feminism grew out of women's emergence into the wartime labour market. Unsurprisingly, the film was scripted and directed by women. The film follows Catrin's blossoming from secretary into excellent screenwriter and from a subservient position in her affair with a painter into independence. The typist grows into writer. The female characters' incidental conversation, what the male writers call ""slop,"" develops into the work's emotional heart, especially when Catrin provides the film's close. Her new career sustains her in the face of both her romantic losses. As her second love Buckley explains, people need film to bring a sense of order and coherence into their chaotic lives. Life is chaotic and senseless. Catrin loses both her lovers as a nod to the disorder in real life, for which films' conventionally happy endings console us. So, too, the steady reports of the deaths of marginal characters. As the film intercuts scenes behind the making of the film with clips from that film itself we get a constant layering of reality and its simulations. Often a supposedly real-life scene appears staged, like the set in Hilliard's visit to Catrin's bare flat. Real-life dialogue breaks into script-like eruptions, like most of Hilliard's and Buckley's quips, life spoken by an actor and a writer respectively. The emerging film's liberties with the facts of the original story remind us that art presents truths deeper than the facts of any particular case. Of course art enhances reality. The twin sisters of the film are livelier, prettier and more successful than the shy girls whose failed adventure inspired the film. The handsome dashing American pilot imposed on the film for American interest is carefully trimmed and packaged, in effect disguised, to be effective. When Catrin finally goes to see her movie we see its audience — of course, a reflection of us as we watch the movie about their movie. Their emotions and engagement remind us of why we're at that movie. Their shared experience reflects ours. In fact, evoking an emotional community is the function not just of films but of all the arts. (That's why tyrants target the arts, to suppress alternative visions and to fragment their citizenry.) Hence the sentimental power when Hilliard sings his old folk ballad at the party. Catrin's first lover is an isolated artist, a painter, who does not work with a present audience and proves too selfish to sustain his relationship with Catrin. But he too succeeds by catching the spirit of the time, with paintings of the desolate British cityscapes and industrial scenes. The hopeful pop song Red Sails in the Sunset plays against the grey and ruins of the bombed city. The arts inflect our reality to make it bearable. It's not surprising that this paean to England's lost glory should be appearing now, on the eve of Brexit. What may surprise is that it's directed not by a British super nationalist but by a Danish woman, Lone Scherfig. That could make this film an EU statement in appreciation of its departing member, perhaps a reminder that England can be its glorious self without leaving. But this might be pushing too far. Better to consign its politics to the vital social function of the arts and to the necessity of women's self-realization.",Their Finest,1661275
39,richard-1787,"Definitely not a comedy, but I'm not sure what it is instead",6/10,7 May 2017,"From the review I read in the local newspaper, I was expecting this to be a comedy about the travails of making a movie during wartime in Britain. It's not that, but I'm not sure what it is instead.There are certainly funny moments, but they and the romantic moments are sometimes - deliberately, it seems - cheek by jowl with unexpected and very severe tragedy. Every now and then the movie reminds us, in the most direct and usually unprepared way, that life in London during the bombing was terrible, and that many lives were shattered when they were not altogether destroyed.Still, even after several such sudden tragic moments, I was jarred by the death of the male lead, the screen writer, when he was killed not by a bomb but by a large shelf that collapsed on top of him. I felt resentful that I was being played with, as much as sorry for the woman who loved him and had just seen him crushed before her eyes.Sometimes I had the impression the script for this movie, which others have praised but which I did not like, was in fact written as we see the script of the movie-within-a-movie, Dunkirk, being written in this movie: scenes dashed off, often out of order, by several people not always working together.That said, and much to my surprise, I found myself very moved by some of the scenes we see at the end of the movie from ""Dunkirk"". They look cheaply made, nothing like ""Mrs. Miniver"", for example, which was the great Hollywood effort to convince Americans to go into the war to help the British, but yet they are moving in their simplicity, even through we have seen those same lines butchered during rehearsal previously.This is not a bad movie, by any means. But for me, it was sometimes an aggravating one, which is why I only gave it a 6.",Their Finest,1661275
40,robbotnik2000,"Well done period piece, evocative and entertaining",8/10,7 November 2017,"Imagine your country fresh into the active part of a war you're not winning. You need a job and wind up on the screen writing team of a group of actors and producers who are putting together a patriotic war film of the recent fiasco in France culminating in the disorganized rescue of hundreds of thousands of soldiers from the beaches at Dunkirk. As you are doing all this, bombers are flying over your head and you keep losing bits of the set and various co-workers.This is the tale told in ""Their Finest"" a well-done film of the type that the British still manage to pull off, going into their past and providing believable representation of a different time.The simple to describe task of turning out a creditable patriotic war film is complicated by the various parties who review the work and not only critique the film, but have the power to make major changes what appears to be any time. The characters are continually at work making allowances for a script that does not follow reality because the reality was much more mundane than drama calls for, or when actors renege or forced upon cast members can't act, or a script-writer is called away.The cast is well chosen and capable and attractive. The movie set within a movie is cleverly written and depicted. This movie is entertaining, draws the viewer in, does not 'appear' to be full of surprises but was clearly a work of technical expertise that paid off.",Their Finest,1661275
41,MikeyB1793,Sags,6/10,16 May 2017,"For the most part I thought that Gemma Aterton and Sam Claflin carried this film along – which it really needed sometimes. It's about the making of B-grade film during the London Blitz to rouse the people of England – and also to appeal to the U.S. audience. This brings to mind - how good can a film be that is about the making of a grade B film? I just felt this film sagged at times – it lacked energy and enthusiasm, it needed a jolt. One kind of occurred when the film- makers met with Anthony Eden who emphasized the requirement for this film to also be made for a U.S. audience.Considering that I am interested in this time period, but have reservations about the film – it won't be around for years hence – I don't feel it has much interest for a general audience.",Their Finest,1661275
42,myriamlenys,doesn't have all that much to say or teach,4/10,3 February 2018,"This tragicomedy contains things to like, such as a sensitive and careful reconstruction of everyday life during wartime. There are also flashes of wit and insight to savour. But it is unclear what, if anything, the movie hopes to say or teach or achieve. Does it want to tell us that life is short and war is cruel ? That movies, especially propaganda movies, tend to embellish and embroider ? That the making of movies, especially propaganda movies, is a demanding and capricious business ? But surely we knew all that ?Another of the movie's themes concerns the shifting role and work division between men and women. But again, there have been other, earlier movies that treated the same subject. Besides, it's difficult to pick up a school book on modern Western society that doesn't mention this transformation.The biggest disappointment, for me, came from the scenes where the viewer (finally !) gets to see the propaganda movie about the Dunkirk evacuation. You expect something grand, something sweeping, something stunning - or, who knows, perhaps something cheesy or chaotic beyond belief. Instead you are rewarded with a few glimpses of what seems like a nicely crafted but unremarkable work. It's underwhelming, especially for a sweeping epic that was supposed to rouse the USA to full-throated fury. Was this the movie that launched a thousand ships and burnt the topless towers of Ilium? No, mate, it wasn't.",Their Finest,1661275
43,chriskylie,Twee but charming,6/10,16 August 2020,"Their Finest is as twee and quaint as British cinema gets, yet a distinguished and committed cast somehow manage to elevate an otherwise cliched and trite script to become a pleasant watch. Nighy is a particular delight, clearly sending himself and fellow luvvies up a treat and Arterton manages to permeate a heavily laid on Welsh accent to produce a convincing and warm performance. It's all highly far fetched and tonally unsubstantial, but Their Finest just about retains enough charm to keep you onside.

44,marklear-1,Not quite what I expected,5/10,21 April 2017,"This film is a story of the scriptwriters who produced movies during World War 2 to show to the British public, so, as other reviewers have said, it is a film within a film. However, I did not find the overall experience very satisfying. The acting is fine by many of the players, although there was a tendency to caricature which I found unnecessary. I should emphasize that there are some highlights too, including the rescue, and a scene in a cinema, both towards the end of the film. Very good! Overall though, I felt that the continuity of the story lines did not work all that clearly, and, in particular, there are a few ""surprises"" in the script which I felt were a negative to the flow of the plot. It seems odd to say (given that there are two film scripts within the story) that I think the script writing needed more work.

Arterton gives a well-judged, engaging performance capturing her character's naivety and diffidence. What works is the way it both gently mocks and celebrates the British in wartime. A particular delight being Nighy as a narcissistic, conceited former matinee idol.It's not all jingoistic - there is plenty of death and destruction with victims of the Blitz lying in the London rubble. Some of the in-jokes begin to grate but the film has enough heart never simply to seem like a lampoon of wartime British cinema.

46,spookyrat1,Blitzing!,7/10,5 April 2019,"The ensemble dramedy is a genre the Brits have just about made their own over the past three decades (Think Four Weddings and a Funeral, Love Actually and The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, just to name a few.) Their Finest is another that can be added to the list, although in my opinion it is a little light on in the laughs department.Gemma Arterton is extremely watchable in the central role of Catrin Cole, a budding scriptwriter, attempting to assert herself in a traditional male domain, during the dark days of the Blitz in 1940 London. Despite her attractive charismatic presence, I'm just not sure of the need for a Welsh accent on the part of her character. There were instances throughout the film where it was just rather difficult to clearly hear and understand the dialogue of Catrin and a number of the supporting characters.No such comprehension difficulties with Bill Nighy's delightfully self-possessed, but past his prime actor, Ambrose Hilliard. He has the best of the comic moments played out on the both screens, in this film within a film, which is partly concerned with the making of a British war-time propaganda film designed to both improve national morale and lure America into the then, ""European conflict"".The supporting cast is terrific, but for me, Jeremy Irons as an extremely theatrical Secretary of War, really stood out in what was not much more than a cameo, but proved to be the singularly most humorous scene in the movie, as he, whilst quoting Shakespeare, outlined his vision of the way the film's production could benefit the British war effort.There are several stories vying for attention in this movie directed by Danish director Lone Scherfig; the quietly restrained proto-feminist journey of Catrin, the frequently comic, sometime tragic making of The Nancy Starling movie and the (very) slowly developing romance between Catrin and her fellow screen writer Tom Buckley, played by Sam Claflin. Of these the latter is arguably less successful. I think just a few more sparks were required in this slow-burner to move things along at a livelier pace, whilst reducing the number of times we see a frustrated Buckley wrestling with the creative dampeners of writer's block. Having said that the third act with a major twist in play, draws all the narrative strands together beautifully. Scherfig's handling of the scenes depicting a Blitz-affected London are also outstandingly realistic, whilst notably avoiding employing traditional war-time battle segments.If a stirring, mildly sentimental peek into the process of WW2 British propaganda film-making spiced with a little romance, sounds like your cup of tea, Their Finest is likely to just provide the fillip for you.",Their Finest,1661275
47,andrewcl-31356,Serves numerous purposes; Blitz-era London.,8/10,18 April 2022,"The setting is WWII London with ""the boys"" trapped in Dunkirk needing a ride home. London is getting shelled and jobs are increasinly available for women.A small struggling studio is filming a war propaganda movie required to be ""authentic and optimistic"". The mission expands to include gaining the American market as the production builds momentum.I even enjoyed this shoestring movie's segments, simple and silly as they were, apppropriate for the 1940s. Ironically the bigger movie producers might have been thinking the same thing, using an English not needing close captioning.The Finest Hour writers want to serve a feminist purpose and it doesn't hurt anything--- except to botch the (near-)ending. Which, is what most movies do anyway, regardless of any purpose a movie is put to.The thing is, without this angle, the plot may have been too slight, and the movie never made, and it was worth a watch.Drama, romance, & tragedy are present but not the goal or achievement... Varied comedy including some lol humor... Accurate history to my knowledge, limited by the inclusion of a ""women's side of war"" mentality realistic to the era... a couple larger ironies in effect...

What a pity the production team tried to impose (BBC-style) a dull-witted and ill-fitting feminist take on a struggling comedy also featuring moments of semi-successful drama - one might have made a far more meaningful and powerful film for women by staying a little closer to actual facts, or a much better comedy by simply forgetting the doubtful sexual politics, or an actual drama by forgetting the other two elements - instead this film fails at all three levels and merely irritates by its inauthenticity. Thank God the dependable Bill Nighy is at hand to give us a couple of chuckles. There's a briefly enjoyable musical interlude half way, but even this I suspect owes far more to Goodwood revival than to the real 1940's Britain. Oh yes, and the inexplicable array of poor and anachronistic accents, yeek. Why was the lead character supposed to be Welsh anyway? And why on earth did they decide the film-in-film was to be in Technicolor? Utter rot.

Some of us sometimes lead dialogues with someone else, in our own heads. The chosen ones translate those dialogues from their own heads in front of others' eyes. They are the storytellers.Most of us remember the meaningful dialogues that happened in our lives. Some of us are able to recall them vividly. The chosen ones are able to give them context and closure and to recreate them as narrations. They are the storytellers.This is a movie about the chosen ones. Indeed it is one fine story about the storytellers.But it is so much more than that: It is as much a movie about the gift of storytelling as a form of fine artisanship, as it is a movie about gift of storytelling as a vital part of all meaningful romantic relationships. Remember how they say that good old soul mates are able to finish each others' lines? Well what if they are able to go even further, and invent each others' lines, or scenes, hell even whole scenarios? Powerful relationship can work on so many levels! Such was my relationship with this movie: so many layers, oh so many levels. The last one is about the last resort, the human imagination. In every hardship, be it individual (such as loss), or collective (such as war) imagination offers a safe place, safer even than a war-shelter. (Btw this movie shows that imagination can be symbolically tied to the woman as both can be warm and cozy getaways). But more than that, in the time of trouble, the imagination is not only a passive getaway imagination can lead to salvation, by instigating heroism and humanism in people. This movie was about that.

52,SJFlann,All that cinema can do well is done here,10/10,16 September 2017,"All that film can do well is done here. It's suitable for family viewing w/ only a rare cuss word. The tale rolls along with life's humor (Bill Nighy is Oscar-worthy) and with life's pain. It's well paced, with soul-mate love and other facets of life too. Kudos for the 1938-ish Britian setting, which is shown in excellent detail. Film- loving ""persons-on the-street"", your time will be well-spent.

53,philipfoxe,Jaw droppingly awful,2/10,18 December 2020,"If there were prizes for the most continuity errors and insults to intelligence this would be out in front. Almost too many to mention. Everyone has to smoke..all the time..preferably by actors who've watched people smoking in movies and are entirely unaware of the of the tight arsed establishment public school culture of the BBC. Our erstwhile heroine just happens to be walking along when a bomb exploded next to her(she's presumably the one person in London who doesn't pay attention to air raid sirens) She picks herself out of the rubble and manages to arrive home.. spotless! But that hardly matters since the next day she has a brand new expensive outfit! No clothes rationing for her! Oh yeah, and in her joke of an interview she offers the information that her husband was injured in Spain. So.. he's a Communist! Yeah that would impress the rights wing gits! You would NOT mention it! But the script is just full of awful clichés that no one would have said, not to mention floppy hair wigs and plain glass specs which would be fine in am dram.. just terrible..

54,Mich-93787,Wonderful film that leaves you smiling and warm inside,9/10,20 August 2017,"Being Danish myself, I am familiar with former work done by Lone Scherfig and by her relatives (Hans Scherfig; Det forsømte forår) and I must say I enjoy it when I feel the film has (the) European touch to it. Also having read the book the film was adapted on 'Their finest hour and a half' by Lissa Evans, I was not disappointed. Nevertheless. Having said this, I really enjoyed watching 'Their Finest' with its wonderful cast: Gemma Arterton portrays Catrin Cole to perfection, she looks and acts (behaves) exactly how I was imagining Catrin, when reading the book. Her persona is perfect for a film set in the 1940s. Bill Nighy is, as always, fantastic. His performance in this film is a balance of being perfectly funny and miserable, on spot for a character like Hilliard. And not to forget, Mr. Sam Claflin, stunning and charming as he is, his character 'Tom Buckley' has it too.All in all, I must say I really enjoyed watching 'Their Finest', having a, sometimes, nerdy approach to the history of the world wars means when watching a film with ww2 settings and the London Blitz, as 'Their finest' have, that beautifully shows how to mix history, horror and love, it simply gives an amazing feeling. The film touches every shade of feeling of the palette and (most likely) has you crying with both sorrow and happiness, feeling nervous, excited and understanding with the Tom Buckley-plot twist in the end. I will admit, it had me feeling lost in the moment but after having ''swallowed'' and analyzed the message behind it and what happened with Catrin's character next, I became more understanding and accepting of Tom's fate. As I wrote earlier, 'Their Finest' is a film that has your feelings and senses mixing up throughout the entire film and if you enjoy a love story and/or has an interest in the art of film making and in the history of the World wars, most definitely should you watch this film. I can and will definitely recommend this film to my peers.Michelle Jensen, Copenhagen.",Their Finest,1661275
55,Marc_Israel_365,Missed opportunity about English WWII film propaganda and those diligent folks striving to deliver their finest.,7/10,27 September 2017,"This reviewer ""so"" wanted to love this film. A light comedy about script writers writing and improvising on the fly while WWII crashes all around them, They are making a propaganda film and must keep the message positive despite what we all see. This experience mirrors the audience. The light or even sweet moments are fluff more than strikingly poignant, To be clear, our lead is adept at being sweetly (I said it again) stoic in the face of sexism, infidelity and in the midst of the blitz, but she hardly falters and seems almost unaffected. It may be the English way, bust as they said about Americans, we like our action, even in the script. Gemma Altertion is beautiful but is left to remind us about the woman' perspective in ways that make men seem incompetent. This could have been more of a light comedy to balance the war deaths, but the comedy is too lite, and the drama ineffective. The Germans were more on target then this film, full of potential, but eventually full of itself.

56,gcsman,"This is a wonderful movie. Depth, heart, great acting across the board.",10/10,11 January 2022,"For me this movie is a 10/10. I saw Their Finest when it first came out in the theaters (2016) and loved it -- and I just re-watched it on Netflix and am even more impressed. It stands up. What strikes me most of all is that it might be a small scale picture but a really *complete* picture -- it's a war story; it's a love story; it's a movie about moviemaking; it's a feminist history; it's about ordinary people growing beyond their boundaries. There's deft humor with perfect timing; heartbreak and romance; drama, tension, and character development; a clear storyline as a film about making films -- all put across by a wonderful cast. It's hard to pigeonhole as one category or another, but by the end it's a thoroughly satisfying experience. You'll laugh, you'll tear up, you'll be absorbed.Loads of credit for all this goes to the lead, the wonderful Gemma Arterton (I wanted to say 'magnificent' but that might make her sound too old) and also that national treasure Bill Nighy. Both of these actors have a rare ability to command the screen and make any movie they are in better. Not that the rest of the cast is at all second-rate. Sam Claflin, Rachael Sterling, Richard E. Grant, Helen McCrory stand out as well in many scenes, and wait for Jeremy Irons in his single scene playing an aristocratic and oh-so-slightly tone-deaf Secretary of War.Looking back on it a second time, I can't think of a single scene that is wasted or superfluous. This is a gem, so sit back and enjoy. I think it would make a great package in a trilogy with 'Dunkirk' (2017) and 'Darkest Hour' (2017) to round out the British experience of the first two years of World War II.",Their Finest,1661275
57,scottingram,Their Finest Film Review,8/10,26 April 2017,"The new drama film Their Finest set during World War 2 in London, England starring Bill Nighy, Gemma Arterton, Sam Claflin.In Their Finest 1940, London, the Blitz; with the country's morale at stake, Catrin Cole (English actress Gemma Arterton - Quantum Of Solace, Runner Runner), an untried screenwriter, and a makeshift cast and crew, work under fire to make a film to lift the nation's flagging spirits; and inspire America to join the war.

58,catnapbc,Not the finest nor the worst,6/10,28 July 2023,"Apart from an occasional original line and scenario, this 'feminist' take on London during the Second World War could have been much better. Despite the inclusion of a number of fine actors/actresses, the writing and storylines have been done many times before and better than this. It comes across as very light-hearted and amateurish, which does a disservice to the important themes within it. Women's roles, the loss of young men, the deprivations, and the importance of propaganda and film with regards to keeping up the morale of a struggling nation. The acting was really not up to snuff and the overwhelming music score and constant emphasis on smoking is very distracting and irritating. The last thing we need is making smoking popular and worth emulating for a new generation. Although the British are usually tops for character development and period pieces, this movie falls short, in my view. Watch something a bit more 'realistic' unless you really want this very superficial entertainment. Foyle's War and Land of Hope and Glory are much better attempts at this subject. As is Bletchley Park for a female-centric show.

59,mabell-19335,Gemma lights up the screen!,10/10,11 December 2018,"Gemma Arterton, Sam Claflin, Bill Nighy, and a stellar cast of British character actors shine a light on the movie making process in which fact gives way to truth in order to tell a compelling story. There is humor and pathos, intrigue and great courage, hardships and sacrifices, all set during the siege of London. Directed by Lone Scherfig, based on a novel by Lissa Evans, I can highly recommend it.

60,JackCerf,A Valentine To The Movies,6/10,21 February 2018,"Protag (Gemma Arterton) is a young woman in 1940 London. She's living with an artist who isn't bringing in that much, so she gets a government typing job. They send her to the Ministry of Information to type scripts for short propaganda films of the ""don't waste food"" genre. She becomes a screenwriter because the men who run the unit decide they need a ""woman's viewpoint"" to make their scripts more effective. She's smart and ambitious and becomes a real contributor. When she reads a newspaper item about two spinster sisters who took their fishing boat to Dunkirk, she decides that this would make a great story for a full length propaganda feature, and she goes down to the coast to interview the sisters. Of course, what really happened is nothing like the news story, but no matter. She works up a treatment, sells it in the pitch meeting, and keeps working on revisions as it gets made. In addition to the crap she has to take because she's a woman, there are the usual problems. The actor cast to play the drunken uncle for comic relief (Bill Nighy) is a once popular matinee idol whose ego won't accept that he's now a has been. They have to work a dog into the script. The Ministry of Information decides that they need an American character to sell the picture in the US, so they have to figure out how to plausibly get a Yank to Dunkirk. (They make him a war correspondent covering the British Army.) To play him, the Ministry sends them an American RAF pilot who is knee-buckling handsome but has never acted before. One after another, the script problems are overcome and the production moves forward. You can see from the bits of movie within a movie that it's a real piece of cheese, and no Mrs. Miniver, but it suits the times and is a popular and commercial success. Like Day For Night and State and Main, it's a valentine to the business of making movies that shows you how much intelligence and effort goes into even hack work.",Their Finest,1661275

So now I'm thinking it was actually pretty great movie - as it still resonates with me. Initially, I didn't like that it was about something as upbeat as movies in the middle of a war - the contrast of the two made the plot seem a bit silly and unnecessary. However, I now understand that this movie is about the frailty of life, living in the moment and maybe even about opportunity/second chances.

62,hogana-43305,Exceptionally good film,8/10,18 August 2018,"This film is a complex interweaving of two stories. The struggle for recognition for the woman scriptwriter is one. And the film within the film which reveals the everyday struggles of ordinary people under the conditions of war is the other.Though it is gentle and humorous and could clearly be dismissed by a particularly unthinking viewer, this film subtly points up the inequalities faced by women both in the historical period depicted (WW2) and by extension still now. The best standard bearer yet for the #metoo generation.

64,dave-mcclain,"""Their Finest"" is entertaining and enlightening, but eventually descends into melodrama.",6/10,14 April 2017,"London. 1940. The Blitz. One year into World War II, all of England, especially the capital, was subjected to nightly bombings by the German Air Force, attempting to soften up England for an amphibious invasion or force the British into a negotiated peace. Hitler's Luftwaffe targeted wartime industries, as well as population centers, hoping to demoralize the British people, but the English were resolute. New British Prime Minister Winston Churchill encouraged his people with a speech to Parliament in which he said, ""Let us therefore brace ourselves to our duties, and so bear ourselves, that if the British Empire and its Commonwealth last for a thousand years, men will still say, This was their finest hour."" British propagandists used the medium of film to help Churchill in his efforts to maintain morale. Borrowing that last phrase from Churchill's speech (and tweaking it to make it into a movie reference), Lissa Evans' 2009 novel ""Their Finest Hour and a Half"" tells the fictional story of a British Ministry of Information team making a dramatic film in the hopes of boosting morale in Britain – and maybe help convince the U.S. to enter the war and help the British defeat Nazi Germany. The 2017 comedy-drama-romance ""Their Finest"" (R, 1:57) is the film version of Evans' story about the making of that propaganda film.Catrin Cole (Gemma Arterton) is struggling. Besides enduring the Blitz with her fellow Londoners, she is struggling financially with her starving artist husband, Ellis (Jack Huston), and struggling to be taken seriously as a writer, in spite of her gender. The British Ministry of Information has come to realize that some of their scripts need a feminine touch and Catrin is hired based on her work in a newspaper. It's a big step forward in her career – and a chance to help pay the rent for her London apartment. Although some of the powers that be are less than respectful regarding Catrin's contributions, her writing partners, Tom Buckley (Sam Claflin) and Raymond Parfitt (Paul Ritter), accept her as part of the team.As the ministry is searching for a feature film idea that would boost morale around the country, Catrin comes across the story of twin sisters who took their father's fishing boat and sailed across the English Channel to participate in the famous (and, in this story, very recent) Dunkirk evacuation. Catrin soon learns that the newspaper account of the sisters' role in the evacuation had been exaggerated and they had never even made it to Dunkirk. Although the issue gives her pause, Catrin pitches the more heroic version of the twins' story, the ministry buys in, a producer comes on board and everyone gets to work.Under the watchful eye of a disagreeable ministry representative (Rachael Stirling) and in the midst of micromanaging from the higher-ups in the ministry, Catrin, Buckley and Raymond punch up the sisters' story even further and continue to revise their script on location. The sisters' real-life father ends up appearing in the film as a drunk uncle who was asleep below deck when the ladies sailed for Dunkirk. Cast as the uncle is an arrogant past-his-prime movie star named Ambrose Hilliard (Bill Nighy), who swallows his pride to accept the role but still remains his old, difficult self on set. The British Secretary of War (Jeremy Irons) wants the film to reach American audiences as well, so he forces a late addition to the cast – an American pilot (Jake Lacy) who made a name for himself as a volunteer flying with the RAF, but who has no acting ability at all. Also on set, there's romance in the air between Catrin and Buckley.""Their Finest"" is entertaining and enlightening, but eventually descends into melodrama. The lighthearted moments are frequent and effective (especially in Nighy's expert hands) and the story helps bring to light the challenges of working women during WWII, as well as the harsh realities of civilian life during the Blitz. Unfortunately, the excellent script by Gaby Chiappe and the fine direction by Lone Scherfig become less impressive in the film's third act, which feels contrived and unnecessarily maudlin. ""Their Finest"" might not be their finest, but it's worth a look. ""B""",Their Finest,1661275
65,handmethatspanner,This would be a ten but for the historical setting,9/10,4 December 2022,"By which I mean, you know how it will end and the complications are all required from the outset. This is a slice of life that once was.Sigiled as a comedy -- it is not. There are moments of comic relief but only traditional Greek thespians would label it a Comedy.Evidently this has excessive emotional depth for too many and far too few kinetic or pyrotechnical elements for a great number of viewers. I can think of no other reason for what I think are lame reviews.-- you just remember this the next time you rant about thin plots and shallow feature films. I bet this is a cult classic before long.This is a really well drawn story -- what you might not know is that the premise goes beyond plausible -- Greer Garson and Walter Pidgeon were cast in just such a film at the time (1940) of this story; Mrs. Miniver --and its a really good one few folks still standing have seen. The sequel, not so much.Part of my pleasure is the cast, many of whom I think very highly of and they shine here.As a foreshadowing we just might see modern austerities cloaking Europe in the near future unless we are lucky.",Their Finest,1661275
66,vsks,"Complete with laughs and tears, a well-acted film all around",8/10,16 May 2017,"While this drama, adapted by Gabby Chiappe Directed by Lone Scherfig, is too serious to be a comedy, it offers many laugh-out-loud moments, as well as a few tears along the way. The conceit is that the British government has commissioned a feature film that will inspire Britons and, with luck, the Americans too, to support the war effort. The subject: the inspiring evacuation of Dunkirk. The filmmakers realize they need to appeal to women in the audience, so they hire a young woman (Gemma Arterton) for the writing team to create ""the slop""—that is, the female dialog. She turns out to more than fill the bill and has the chance to find her own voice along the way. In addition to Arterton, fine performances from Sam Claflin as the cynical head writer, Bill Nighy as an over-the-hill actor who's never fully convinced he shouldn't be the romantic lead, Rachael Stirling as a spy for the foreign office with a soft heart, and Helen McCrory as Nighy's no-nonsense agent. You'll love the Jeremy Irons cameo, in which he gets carried away delivering Henry V's ""band of brothers"" speech.

She has talent, but it doesn't get recognized until she winds up working as a scriptwriter for the Propaganda Office. It's there that she meets the talented scriptwriter Tom Buckley (Sam Claflin). The rest of the movie pretty much goes on more-or-less predictably from there. According to the movie, the propaganda films being used at the time to prop up British morale were so bad that people laughed at them. London was undergoing the blitz, and morale needed propping up. Finally, approval is given to a propaganda movie that people would enjoy. As well as boosting morale, the hope was that the movie, when distributed in the U.S., would help make the case for America joining the allied cause.The topic chosen was the British retreat from Dunkirk. Clearly, a retreat is not the same as a victory. However, rescuing over 300,000 troops from death or capture was a positive outcome, under the circumstances. Historically, the troops were saved by more than naval vessels. Many people crossed the channel to France in fishing boats, tugboats, and private vessels. They brought back thousands of troops. Two sisters commandeered their father's fishing boat and set off for France. Their --as improved by the screenwriters--becomes the core of the propaganda film.The rest of the movie intertwines romance with movie-making. Most of the characters are more or less stereotypes that we've all seen before. These include the stuffy without-a-clue officials, Catrin's temperamental artist husband, and the U.S. actor who is actually a war hero, but can't act.The exception is Bill Nighy, who plays Ambrose Hilliard, an actor who appeared in many Sherlock Holmes type films, but who is 63 and not 36, as he is told. This is also a stock part, but Nighy brings so much talent to it that his character comes alive.What was interesting to me was that, despite all odds, the movie within a movie turned out to be more diverting than ""Their Finest."" I'm not sure whether that's a compliment or a criticism of this film.We saw this movie on the large screen at the excellent Little Theatre in Rochester, NY. It will probably work a little better if you see it in a theater, but it will work well enough on the small screen. It's not an outstanding movie, but it's definitely worth seeing.P.S. One of the songs on the soundtrack is ""They Can't Black Out the Moon."" It's really a pleasant, catchy number. I thought that it was written for the movie. However, it actually was a WW II song. You can listen to it on YouTube.",Their Finest,1661275
70,Jackthemovielover,Very entertaining angle on movies during WW II,9/10,1 May 2017,"This is a very entertaining look at a an angle on WW II history that is rarely treated. From the perspective of a propaganda film production office in London, it shows the lives of writers and their associates as they struggle to survive the war's effects on their lives. Aside from the obvious effects like neighbors and friends being killed, this film illustrates such subtler effects as women's progress during the war, the politics between the US and England at that time, and the manipulation of truth by governments. It has some great lines, that included references to tragedy in life versus tragedy in story, and perseverance in life in the face of death. The story itself is genuinely touching, but it does not get bogged down in sadness, as the very believable characters manage to carry on with what they must do in their work and relationships. The acting is generally excellent, and the direction and cinematography are polished to support the story, without distracting from it. Even seemingly jarring scenes are put in their place with tact and sound judgment. This shows the work of experienced, professionals. I highly recommend this film for its entertainment value, as well as other reasons for which to see it. It does well with insights into life in London during the War, the examination of truth and falsehood in movies, feminism in the 1940's, and the history of film making.",Their Finest,1661275
71,frukuk,Their OKest,3/10,15 October 2022,"Reasonably enjoyable, though a little long, and far more of a light romance set on the home front in WWII than a drama about WWII and all its horrors.The performances are fine, but the script lacks the depth to really bring the best out of the actors.There's an incident towards the end which is so clearly telegraphed that I was saying out loud: ""I really hope they're not going to do what I think they're going to do."" But they were, and that incident felt like a far too unsubtle attempt to play on the heartstrings.So, it's certainly worth watching if you have a couple of hours that need filling and it is available to stream, but it's not good enough to be worth seeking out.

73,pauear,A really enjoyable movie,9/10,30 November 2017,"This film was a throwback to the great days of film making. The war is merely a background to a story about a group of people trying to do their best in the face of adversity. It's also about women emerging into the workplace and fighting for their right to play a broader role in society. The characters all work together to generate a real empathy with the audience. Mainly, it contains fun, romance, heartbreak, redemption, a good story, fine acting and a warm heart. Park your cynicism for 2 hours and Enjoy.

74,jonathan-harris17,Charming if slight,6/10,30 December 2017,"Wartime-set drama (during the Blitz), that's part cap-tip to working women, part acclamation to the power of cinema.Arterton as the lead, Catrin, is hired early on as the sole woman on a small script writing team for the Ministry of Information, looking to the inspire the many at home and Americans abroad into joining the war in one swoop.Arterton is solid enough in her portrayal, and the script nuanced enough to push the stories & plight of women in general with tact -- no grandstanding here -- and she's an entertaining, bright foil to Sam Claflin's lead-writer Buckley.The romantic sub-plots here are a little to predictable, as is the denouement, thought Catrin is interesting enough for these to be passed off as forgivable.The film clearly takes some delight in it's portrayal of old-timey film-making, and the actors working on them (Bill Nighy a deft-hand here as usual).Entertaining, charming stuff here with a nice trim running time and engaging performances. Nothing especially stellar.",Their Finest,1661275

The story line was completely uninteresting, the characters, their concerns and emotions, I couldn't relate to any of it and I don't know what life one must have lived to be able to do so.

Nothing hangs together. The clunky script lumbers along with blantant predictability. No chemistry between actors. Old Bill doing his usual old Bill thing. The scenes of war torn London straight out of a comic book. Gemma doing her best. Weird histrionics from some of the male actors.And forced and unconvincing sentimentality with sickening emotional music swirling in when we don't give a damn about the plight of a single character.The love interest is straight out of Barbara Cartland. It's a wonder anyone sat through this.Ignore the glowing reviews. Anyone who thinks this is a good film has no idea what a good film really is. This is a film for teenagers who know nothing about the war....or cinema.Avoid..",Their Finest,1661275
77,otterman62,a missed opportunity,5/10,22 June 2018,"I would love to have given this film a much higher mark, but i felt it missed a golden opportunity to produce a potential classic. It has all the right ingredients, a good likeable cast, a topical subject with the recent films on dunkirk and churchill raising interest in this era, a clever premise of them making a film within a film, and there are some nice lines and good performances (Bill Nighy is excellent as always) but for me they blow it through the death of one of the leading characters. I understand they may have felt they were making a point about war, but for me they were being too clever. A nice happy ending would have left the film as a classic feel good film, like a ""local hero"", instead of a slightly frustrating one. This is especially annoying as within the film Gemma Artertons character is advised to make sure one of their films has a happy ending. A pity they didn't heed their own advice.",Their Finest,1661275
78,phd_travel,Inventive and unexpectedly funny,7/10,27 June 2017,"Cute charming and quite inventive this is a different aspect of the Blitz. A perky young lady writes a propaganda film to boost morale during WWII. It is very insightful and funny to see how a simple tale of two ladies bringing their boat towards Dunkirk but the engine failed so they didn't get there, gets twisted and embellished to suit the needs of the war office. Characters are given a heroic slant and the story is tailored to please an American audience. The horrors of the Blitz in London do come through now and then. The acting is top notch. Gemma Arterton looks prettier than in the past. Bill Nighy plays the diva like actor well. Sam Claflin is unrecognizable with a nerdy get up.Very interesting and quite different.

Not only that, it mixed with war and love, so it's never boring. Even when it comes to scriptwriting, different requests from different organisations make it dramatic. Some performance and dialogues are quite funny. It's also clever to see film in the film. I did see people in tears in the end.

80,richardings-40852,The BBC occasionally doesn't waste its money,8/10,5 November 2021,"With the BBC's name attached - an almost sure-fire guarantee of a terrible movie crammed with platitudes and bien pensance - and the usual repertory of jobbing British A-listers, there was little to nothing to suggest that this film might be any good.And yet it is. Very good. This may have something to do with the source material, a novel of which I know very little. It may also have something to do with the light, effective touch of the screenwriter. It had to be, given the meta-narrative of producing a film which seeks to celebrate a feminine contribution to the art - it could so easily have collapsed in on itself. But nothing is telegraphed, much is unexpected, the genre is bent and not broken, and the humorous, underplayed nods to the 'way things used to be done' are absolutely spot-on.Sam Claflin is an absolute revelation in this; had it been Arterton mugging on her own it would have been a nightmare. But Claflin gives her the attention she needs, and no more, takes his time, and lets the terrific script do all the hard work.I can well understand those who will point to elements of formula and deux ex machina shocks - but that's exactly the point of the movie. How do you reinvent the wheel? How do you make a romance that isn't just another Love Actually? There are lots of answers here, and everyone involved should be thoroughly proud of themselves. Even Bill Nighy.And the two musical interludes are absolutely magical. Well done, everyone. Well done.",Their Finest,1661275
81,CallYap,It creeps up slowly into you,10/10,16 November 2022,"Quirky British movie about personal relations and will to fight on. Not giving up the plot, but the emotions go up and down and up. The two main characters are Bill and Gemma and both brings different strength to this movie.Trying not to write a very long summary but they do require you say a lot of stuff, and I am trying my best to comply. Great scenery and costumes. It does have some violence related to WW2, and it did catch many by surprised about 2/3 of the movie in.Great movie to chill out with, during the holidays. Knew it was written by a woman, the characters had good depth. I rest my case.

The people I was with agreed with me and seeing the blank faces of those leaving the film was more entertaining than the film. Discussing it afterwards, I gather that the ending tried to draw out some emotion but fell flat too. The idea was good and could have been a great comedy. What a missed opportunity!

It's ironic that the war, Britain's most terrifying as well as its finest hour, should now have become the ultimate in cosy, reassuring settings for a story.

84,davidgee,Chestnutty comedy,7/10,16 May 2017,"In wartime London a secretary from Wales, Catrin Cole, goes to work for the government's propaganda film division. She has no screen writing experience and is only required to write the 'slop' dialogue for the female characters in their latest production, which dramatises the story of two sisters from Devon who pinched their father's fishing boat to join the rescue of troops from Dunkirk. Of course, Catrin will prove indispensable to the success of the movie.This is a slight comedy-romance with a feel of (deliberate?) amateurishness about it. London during the Blitz is splendidly recreated, but the cast of the movie – as well as the movie within the movie – play it like the members of a provincial repertory company; Jeremy Irons, Richard E. Grant and Henry Goodman turn in fruity cameos. Jake Lacy is appealingly awful as the US war hero pasted into the Dunkirk story, a hero with great looks and zero acting skill. Bill Nighy is encouraged to grandstand as an old ham whose ego is greater than his talent; he plays Ambrose in the style of Laurence Olivier, but the character rather recalls Sir Donald Wolfit (even more wonderfully sent up by Vincent Price in THEATRE OF BLOOD).Gemma Atherton is charming in the central role, although her Welsh accent doesn't always hold up (reminding me of Vivien Leigh's Belgravia Southern belle in GWTW). A star-crossed love story descends into mawkishness towards the end, but the film works best as a tribute to the chestnutty yesteryear comedies from Ealing Studios which we all hold so dear.",Their Finest,1661275
85,paul-allaer,"""Authenticity, optimism... and a dog!""",7/10,30 April 2017,"""Their Finest"" (2016 release from the UK; 117 min.) brings the story of Catrin Cole. As the movie opens, we are informed it is ""London, England, 1940"". We get to know Catrin Cole, who is desperate for a job. When she applies for what she thinks is a secretarial position at the Ministry of Information's Film Division, it turns out she is given an opportunity to contribute much more. This is not to the liking of Catrin's husband, a struggling painter. Meanwhile, the Film Division is looking to make a movie that will cheer up the war-torn population, and even perhaps entice/convinces the US that England hasn't given up. At this point we're 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the big screen adaptation of the book ""Their Finest Hour and a Half"" by Lissa Evans. The movie is directed by Lone Scharfig, best known for her work on ""An Education"" (transporting Carey Mulligan into mega-stardom) and ""Italian For Beginners"". Here Scharfig brings a big scale WWII romantic drama, with plenty of humor sprinkled through. The movie-within-a-movie deals with the Dunkirk evacuation, rather ironic since in a few months Christopher Nolan's next ""big"" movie, simply called ""Dunkirk"", will be released. The Ministry of Information keeps reminding the writers that it is looking for a film with ""authenticity and optimism"", which then is changed to ""authenticity, optimism... and a dog!"" as the movie-within-a-movie sports a cute dog. British actress Gemma Arterton (in the lead role of Catrin Cole), whom we previously enjoyed in movies like ""Gemma Bovery"" and ""Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters"", is delightful once again and carries the movie on her shoulders with ease and with grace. However, she is not the only noteworthy performer. Veteran actor Bill Nighy is hilarious as the old and cranky actor, and brings some great and funny moments. The movie's photography is pure eye-candy, in particular the scenes shot in Pembrokeshire, Wales. Last but certainly not least, the movie has a wonderful orchestral score, courtesy of British composer Rachel Portman (who will be forever known as the first woman to ever win an Oscar for Best Score).""Their Finest"" premiered at last Fall's London Film Festival, to immediate acclaim. It finally opened at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati this weekend, and I couldn't wait to see it. The Saturday early evening screening where I saw this at was PACKED, somewhat to my surprise. Looks like there is a pent-up demand for this kind of movie. ""Their Finest"" seems like a throwback to movies of another era. If you are in the mood for a romantic WWII drama, you cannot go wrong with this. ""Their Finest"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",Their Finest,1661275

87,Reno-Rangan,The war and the cinema!,6/10,24 September 2017,"The film was based on the book and about filmmaking, particularly screen writing. Fictional comedy-drama that is set in London in 1940. While the war tearing apart the nation, some people are not disturbed by it. They are going ahead with their film projects, especially war themed to boost the people's confidence. That's when the new arrival, Mrs. Cole, begins her career as a writer. So her experience working with the scripts, meeting the real people whose story are getting adapted and her gloomy romance, everything lets us know.A nice film and a little different than the majority of the film that came this year. The focus was good. I mean while bombs falling from the sky, all this tale concentrated was film business. Something like 'Argo', but given less preference to the war, except its consequences which diverted their plan in some scenario. So there were many small-small twist and turns. It also gets emotional at one stage. A well written and directed film similar to what the film characters did their best in the story.Gemma was good, but Claflin was totally different, in a good way. As much as I enjoyed, I also thought it should have been even better. Because thematically it was not for everyone. I mean the world war was a good idea, but the filmmaking was not like you are usually familiar with. Besides, it was not a laughing out loud comedy. Between the seriousness of war and fun around making films, the combination was rare and well worked out. Those who love pre 50s, 40s settings in a film would enjoy it for sure.

So often in this charming movie, I asked myself ""How did they create that scene?"" I am too young to have experienced WW2 but I remember the war films of the 1950s and I have seen some of the propaganda films of the war years. The mood of the these films is captured perfectly in ""Their Finest"" (silly title - their finest what?) I would have given 10 / 10 except for one significant weakness. We in the post-9/11 world are used to viewing CCTV film of bombs exploding and we know the extent of the damage to expect. There are scenes in this movie where bombs are supposed to be raining down, yet the damage is little more than one would expect from a large fire-cracker. If a bomb drops on a building, it is unlikely in the extreme that one person will be killed instantly while others standing nearby are totally uninjured. The acting reflects the style of the period beautifully, and comically. Bill Nighy is perfect and everyone else plays their part with enthusiasm. There is a touch of ""Monty Python"" in the stiff upper lip characters. The story has several engaging sub-plots and touches on a number of issues including feminism, British / USA relations, the changing nature of marriage, and politically-motivated lying. This is a record of how we were 75 years ago. Pity that we smoked so much.",Their Finest,1661275

93,IanFRobinson,First film I've given 10/10 to on IMDb,10/10,22 April 2017,"There are mild spoilers below.Their Finest is a drama comedy film about the empowerment of women and the business of making movies. It excels at both brilliantly. It's the best film I've seen this year, and the only film I've rated 10/10 on IMDb. It is an adaption of the novel Their Finest Hour and a Half by Lissa Evans and is set in England during the Second World War. It stars Gemma Arterton, Sam Claflin, and Bill Nighy plus a great supporting cast. The three principle actors all give great performances. Bill Nighy heartily sings a song I haven't heard in decades. Track 19 on the soundtrack album.The story portrays the making of propaganda films by the Ministry of Information Film Division for the 30 million people who went to the cinema every week in the early 1940's. Gemma Arterton plays Catrin Cole who is conscripted to the Ministry to help screenwriters Tom Buckley (Sam Claflin) and Raymond Parfitt (Paul Ritter), by writing women's dialogue, or 'Slop' as it is dismissively called, after Buckley saw some writing she had done previously. The Ministry wants a film that will inspire the populace and stiffen resolve for the war. Buckley, Cole, and colleagues pitch an idea about the evacuation of Dunkirk, and the script development and the making of the film are the main story lines of Their Finest. As a film about filmmaking, it succeeds wonderfully. Better than Hail, Caesar! that also touched on this subject from a different angle last year. The green-board evolution of the script over time provides an excellent backdrop to show progress in the office where Buckley, Cole, and Parfitt work.Their Finest has the feeling of a 1940's film while at the same time not feeling old. From the font in the opening credits to the sets depicting wartime London, the costumes (I want to buy a decent coat now!), and the music, the period feel is spot on. They even have the institutionalised sexism nailed as well, which gives a nice counterpoint to the empowerment of women theme that runs through the film.Their Finest is perfect. I can't think of anything in it that disappointed or that I would change. Which is why I rated it 10/10. It comes with a huge recommendation from me. I plan to see it again in the cinema and I've pre-ordered it on iTunes.",Their Finest,1661275
