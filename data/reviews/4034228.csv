0,ronakkotian,Utterly depressing...,9/10,12 July 2020,"This film left me feeling all sorts of emotions. It's definitely one of the most depressing films I've ever seen.Manchester by the Sea tells the story of a depressed man named Lee who has to take care of his brother's son after his unfortunate death.This is not a film that you go to watch for a good time. Manchester by the Sea made me feel really sad throughout the entirety of it and it's mainly done through the amazing performances and level of authenticity writer-director Kenneth Lonergan creates. This film is very simple. It's not stylish in any way and Lonergan's script maintains the realism through the runtime. At no point did I think there were actors playing the characters because the performances and conversations they were all having seemed too real. This made Lonergan's story about guilt, pain and depression more impactful and heartbreaking.In my opinion, this is a career best performance by Casey Affleck. It's a performance that's rather sombre instead of flashy. His facial expressions are very subtle but you can still tell how broken and unhappy of a man he is. When you first see his character, you tend to dislike him but after finding out the reason why he's so miserable, you root for him and want him to recover from his depressive state. Michelle Williams isn't in the film much but she's brilliant in all the scenes she's present in. I thought Lucas Hedges was good but there were times where I found his accent quite jarring and a scene where he cries didn't seem too realistic.It's best going into Manchester by the Sea not knowing much as I feel it makes the film more poignant. It's may not be an easy watch but I would like people to experience it so they can see the Kenneth Lonergan's talent as well as Casey Affleck's masterful performance.",Manchester by the Sea,4034228
1,subxerogravity,It's as good as everyone is saying it is.,9/10,20 November 2016,"It's just a well crafted picture.Casey Affleck fits into this role like a glove, and he was amazing in it. If he were to win an Oscar for this one that would make sense completely.Manchester by the Sea has Affleck as uncle Lee, a janitor in Boston whose brother dies and is forced by the will to take care of his nephew, a task he's not up to.The movie is very real and strangely raw to be filmed so beautifully (but I am a sucker for movies shot in the winter). It's slow moving enough to notice but not enough to bore you, cause that's life.What really grasp me about Manchester by the Sea is how clumsy it is. So many scenes in which the dramatic punches are ruined by everyday life. It's just not fake like a lot of movies are usually. It had the guts to keep in all those awkward moments that humans go through knowing that we would relate, and it does this without skipping on the romance you would find in dramas like this.It's all the real emotions people go through when life gives you a curve ball, yet life does not allow you a time out. Great movie! Amazing performance by Affleck!! A must see.",Manchester by the Sea,4034228
2,Hitchcoc,As Good as I've Seen,10/10,25 February 2017,"Sometimes we have a work of art that doesn't have as its purpose to make us feel good. The criticism from the nay-sayers of this film talk about how depressing it is; that there is nothing happy about it. What this is is one of the most insightful portrayals of a man consumed with guilt that you will ever see. I know little about Casey Affleck, other than the obvious, but his portrayal of a man who feels the burden of inadvertently killing three of his children, is astonishing. Some say the characters are unlikable, including the son of his deceased brother. Well he is what he is. Yes he's a teenaged womanizer full of testosterone and self, but are we to change it for people that don't like him. That makes the issues that Affleck's character has to reconcile after his brother names him guardian of his son. This is a slice of realism, from his having to deal with his brother's death and all that entails (responsibility for the funeral and the legal issues). He is such damaged goods that someone needs to look after him. This is not a feel-good film. It presents us with a dysfunctional figure who is back in the town where everyone considers him a murderer. Could win the Oscar this year. If not, Affleck probably will.",Manchester by the Sea,4034228
3,howard.schumann,A real experience of life fully lived,10/10,16 October 2016,"Dealing with the aftermath of a tragedy turns a once warm and ebullient family man into a solemn, withdrawn, and angry loner in Kenneth Lonergan's (""Margaret"") bittersweet drama Manchester by the Sea, one of the best films of 2016. Set in the picturesque city of Manchester on Massachusetts' north shore, cinematographer Jody Lee Lipes (""Martha Marcy May Marlene"") captures the rugged beauty of the New England town with its bays filled with trawlers and its winter streets and municipal buildings covered in a shimmering white. It is a town that looks as if it has not changed in decades, or even centuries.Lee Chandler, in a haunting performance by Casey Affleck (""Interstellar""), is a janitor/handyman who spends his days painting, doing minor plumbing work, repairing leaks, and so on or just giving advice while making sure to avoid any social interaction with the people he is working for. His nights are spent drinking alone in bars where he is quick to start fights or at home watching TV in his small apartment. There is no hint during the film's first half hour about what has brought him to his present state of disequilibrium, but in his mumbling inability to express his thoughts, we know that something unspoken is driving his need for isolation.Lee has been living in nearby Quincy but, when his older brother, Joe (Kyle Chandler, ""Carol"") succumbs to a heart attack, he has to return to Manchester to make funeral arrangements and attend the reading of the will and to confront the people that he has turned away from. His grief over his brother's death turns to shock, however, when he discovers that he has been named the legal guardian of Joe's 16-year-old son Patrick (Lucas Hedges, ""The Grand Budapest Hotel""), a popular high school student. Since Patrick's mom Elise (Gretchen Mol, ""Anesthesia"") is an alcoholic who left town long ago, Lee is the only person who can assume the task.It is one, however, that he does not feel ready for. Eventually, the seminal event that changed Lee's life forever is revealed, depicted in a straightforward manner without histrionics or pandering, even if the overused baroque music tends to amplify the drama beyond what is required. In flashback, we see that Lee was once a happy family man with a loving wife Randi (Michelle Williams, ""Suite Fran√ßaise"") and three young children and we see him joking around with his young nephew Patrick (Ben O'Brien) on their fishing boat. Assuming the responsibility of being a father-figure to Patrick, we glimpse the man that Lee used to be.The dialogue between the abrasive Lee and the feisty, sharp-tongued Patrick feels real and without guile but channeling the chemistry they have together into rebuilding his life is a challenge. Manchester by the Sea is a serious film but is balanced by humor. In one such scene, Patrick awkwardly attempts to hide the obvious from his mom about studying in his room with his girlfriend. Another funny incident takes place when Lee is used as a cover for Patrick's surreptitious juggling of his two girlfriends. The issues between them take a more serious tone, however, when Lee is convinced that he and Patrick should move to Boston, a suggestion that Patrick rebels at, citing his high school girlfriends, his being on the soccer team, and his playing in the school band.Though Michelle Williams has a small role, she turns in one of her best performances. In a powerful confrontation with Lee, it is clear that she still loves him but has felt compelled to suppress it in order to bury the past and move on. Manchester by the Sea belongs to Casey Affleck, however, who turns in what is arguably the best performance of his career. The film does not have the sort of neat resolution that you may have come to expect but what it does have are real people whose lives you want to be a part of and you know that that world is not one that can only happen in the movies, but a real experience of life fully lived in all its pain and all its joy.",Manchester by the Sea,4034228
4,TheLittleSongbird,Didn't love it but appreciated it,7/10,21 May 2017,"Being familiar with director Kenneth Lonergan's previous work, one knew what to expect from his chosen themes and his style. 'Manchester By the Sea' has Lonergan written all over it, and while it was not a ""love"" film it was an ""appreciate"" one.It is an uneven film and understandably polarising (people will love the acting, inspired use of music and the mix of humour and pathos but others will find it overlong, slow and rambling), with a first half that will alienate some. There are many things that impress, especially the acting which is what drives 'Manchester By the Sea'. This said, even if my reaction to 'Manchester By the Sea' was less (like it wasn't for me or intensely disliking it, I would have no problem with anybody saying they liked it, not the sort of person who condescends and shows a lack of maturity and respect to other people's opinions (one of my bugbears on IMDb).Getting on to my hopefully balanced review of 'Manchester By the Sea', pointing out its flaws and merits, as said it is easy to see why 'Manchester By the Sea' is not for everybody. It is perhaps longer than necessary, some of the first half did tend to ramble and could have done with a trimming. In fact, the first half generally wasn't as interesting as the rest of the film, and likely to put people off watching any further. It did tend to be dull and meandering, the mix from flashback to present day not always clear and didn't always go anywhere. It was when the tragedy came in and the relationship between Lee and Patrick when 'Manchester By the Sea' becomes more worthwhile if stuck with.After this point, 'Manchester By the Sea's' only faults are a few contrived moments (like the freezer scene and the at times excessive and out of place F bombs) and an ending that falls on the abrupt side.However, 'Manchester By the Sea' has suitably picturesque scenery and is shot with a lot of atmosphere. Lonergan directs with a lot of thoughtfulness and restraint and much of the script has a good balance of humour (with some genuine belly laughs with Lee and Patrick) and pathos (the fire and funeral scenes will have one reaching for the tissues). The show-down between Lee and Randi is beautifully played and electric.'Manchester By the Sea's' best asset is by far the acting. Lucas Hedges makes a compellingly real character out of one that could easily have been annoying, and while Michelle Williams is underused she also gives a remarkably moving performance. Kyle Chandler also impresses. 'Manchester By the Sea' is Casey Affleck's film though, Affleck is on blistering form and has rarely been better in his tough-talking and also introverted role.Also want to mention the music, giving much intensity and poignancy to the drama with inspired use of pre-existing music. Albinoni has never been more affectingly utilised on film, his ""Adagio"" can be one of those over-exposed pieces of music but here added so much to the drama's emotion that it was truly beautiful and haunting. Another effective use of music was ""He Shall Feed His Flock...Come Onto Him"", the alto and soprano duet from Handel's 'Messiah'.In summary, slow start but sticking with it 'Manchester By the Sea' rewards. Didn't love it, but there was enough to make it appreciate it. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Manchester by the Sea,4034228
5,claudio_carvalho,"Tragic, Depressing, with no Redemption",8/10,26 February 2017,"In Quincy, the quiet and ruthless janitor and handyman Lee Chandler (Casey Affleck) is summoned by George (C.J. Wilson), who is a family friend, to go to Manchester since his older brother Joe Chandler (Kyle Chandler) has had a heart attack and is in a hospital. When Lee arrives, Joe has just died and Lee makes arrangements for the funeral with George. Then he seeks out his sixteen year-old nephew Patrick (Lucas Hedges) at the hockey training to tell the news. They go to the morgue and then they head to Joe's lawyer to learn his will. Lee is surprised that Joe has assigned him to be Patrick's guardian. He is reluctant and neither wants to stay in Manchester nor deliver his nephew to his alcoholic mother Elise (Gretchen Mol) and decides to bring Patrick with him to Quincy. However the teenager does not want to leave his life in the town. While planning Joe's burial and funeral, Lee is haunted by his past in Manchester, where he happily lived with his wife Randi (Michelle Williams) and three children until the day a tragedy happened with his family. What will be his final decision?""Manchester by the Sea"" is a realistic film with a tragic and depressing story and no redemption for the lead character. The plot is well resolved for his beloved nephew Patrick but never to Lee, who does not forgive himself for what happened to his family due to his negligence. The direction, screenplay using flashback to explain Lee's behavior and performances are top-notch. Many viewers would expect a more optimistic and happier conclusion but the author chose only a better improvement in the lead character's attitude toward life and this might be the reason of great number of bad reviews. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Manchester √Ä Beira-Mar"" (""Manchester by the Sea"")",Manchester by the Sea,4034228
6,Sleepin_Dragon,"It's a very engaging, character driven story, it's good.",8/10,23 January 2021,"Lee Chandler is made to take on his nephew after his brother dies an untimely death, Lee is incredibly depressed and affected by his past.As the film develops, so does the relationship between Lee and Patrick, we learn why Lee is the way he is, and the events that helped to shape him, and make him such a complex figure.I haven't seen a film like this for some time, it's purely melodrama, but to it's credit, it's very good. Take a tip from Me, if you're in a mood, or feeling down, do not watch this, it will compound your low spirits. If you're up for an engaging, moving two hours on intense character play, you'll find this very good.I had absolutely no idea just how good an actor Casey Affleck is, and that's my own fault, he is absolutely tremendous throughout, he makes Lee a truly interesting guy.The music is a real hindrance here, it detracts from the film, it isn't bad, it's just wrong for the film. Adagio in G Minor, it's a glorious piece of music, but it is so out of place, it jars uncomfortably at a key point.It takes a little time to warm up, and for you to engage, when it does, it's an excellent film, 8/10.",Manchester by the Sea,4034228
7,bob-the-movie-man,A masterpiece of family angst,10/10,26 January 2017,"Wow! I'd heard all about the Oscar hype surrounding this film but to be honest, while I thought I would be seeing a solid and well-made indie film, I went into it without great expectations of having an 'enjoyable' time: the trailer had ""angst"" written all over it. And ‚Äì sure ‚Äì it is emotional and harrowing in places. However, I was completely knocked out by the depth, the intelligence and the humour of this masterpiece.'Family troubles' is a common trope for the movies, and I was strongly reminded at times in watching this movie of a multi-Oscar winning classic of my youth: Robert Redford's ""Ordinary People"" back in 1980. In that film the relationship between parents (Mary Tyler-Moore and Donald Sutherland) and their teenage son (Timothy Hutton) is rocked by the accidental death of another family member. Similarly, in ""Manchester by the Sea"" a drifting handyman Lee Chandler (Casey Affleck, ""Triple 9"", ""Interstellar"") gets the shocking news that his only brother Joe (Kyle Chandler, ""The Wolf of Wall Street"") has suddenly passed away, leaving behind a mid-teens son Patrick (Lucas Hedges) with no-one to look after him.With the other option being an unstable and ex-alcoholic mother Elise (Gretchen Mol) ‚Äì now divorced and living in a strictly pious household with new husband Jeffrey (Matthew Broderick) ‚Äì Joe has legally plumped for naming Lee as the boy's guardian. This is much to Lee's surprise and annoyance. For Lee is a man-adrift: an antisocial loner with a very short fuse. Having any sort of responsibility is not in his game plan.With the ground too frozen to bury his brother, Lee is forced to remain in Manchester-by-the-Sea for a few weeks: a town he can't stand and a town that, for some reason, can't stand him. Can Lee's attitude be softened by his lively and over-sexed nephew? Or will he just continue his emotional and social decline towards a gutter and a brown-bag? Where this film surprises ‚Äì with a strong kick to the gut ‚Äì is that while I have described the high-level story in the paragraphs above that the trailer depicts, there is a whole other dimension to the tale that is hidden and truly astonishing. No spoilers, but if you are not shocked and moved by it, then you need your humanity chip reset.Casey Affleck is Oscar-nominated now for Best Actor and I would love to see him win for this. I had a real go at his brother, Ben, for a lack of facial variation in his performance in ""Live By Night"". Here, while Casey has a similar dour and pretty rigid demeanour, his performance is chalk-and-cheese compared to Ben. He channels a shut-down rage in his eyes that is both haunting and disturbing in equal measure.Young Lucas Hedges ‚Äì overlooked by the BAFTAs (he is in the ""Rising Star"" category) but yesterday nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar ‚Äì is equally strong, burying his teenage grief in guitars, sex and smart phones in a highly believable way.Supporting roles are equally strong, with Michelle Williams ‚Äì albeit only having limited screen time ‚Äì delivering truly memorable scenes, notably the street encounter with Lee (as featured on the poster) which is electrifying. She is also Oscar nominated for the role.What really makes these performances shine is the elegant directing by Kenneth Lonergan, better known for his screenplays on films like ""Analyze This"" and ""Gangs of New York"". He gives the actors time¬Ö lots of time. A typical example is when young Patrick walks into Lee's bedroom and stares at some photos on his bedside table before walking on. It must be a good 20 to 30 seconds used, but time really well spent. The film spectacularly uses flash-backs to great effect, with the only visual notification that you are in a different time-zone being the living and breathing appearance of Joe in the shot.Lonergan also writes the screenplay, and I mentioned in my introduction the humour used. There are some outright belly laughs in this film, which feels incongruous with the morbid subject matter but which also feels guiltily appropriate (we've all surely had an experience where a tense funeral mood is lightened by an uncle loudly farting at the back of the church, or similar!).Manchester-by-the-Sea is a picturesque place in Massachusetts, and the camera work by Jody Lee Lipes (""Martha Marcy May Marlene"", ""Trainwreck"") lovingly makes use of that. There is incredibly crisp focus, with the opening boat scene looks like it is hyper-HD.This is a truly stunning film, and one that will live with me for many years to come. For that reason it receives my highest accolade together with my best wishes for success at the forthcoming Oscars. If you haven't yet, go see it.(For the graphical version of this review please visit bob-the-movie-man.com or search for One Mann's Movies on Facebook.)",Manchester by the Sea,4034228
8,evanston_dad,"An Elegiac, Deeply Moving Film About Broken People",9/10,30 November 2016,"Some people find a way to pick themselves up from the rubble of a personal tragedy and rebuild a life for themselves. Others are permanently broken, and they die in spirit if not in body. ""Manchester by the Sea,"" Kenneth Lonergan's elegiac and deeply heartfelt new film, contains characters who are representative of both of the above responses. The tragedy befalls the characters portrayed by Casey Affleck and Michelle Williams, and the film follows Affleck's character as he unexpectedly becomes guardian of his nephew while trying to exorcise his own personal demons. I've liked Casey Affleck in some things and very much disliked him in others, but here he gives a galvanic performance, one quiet but sustained howl of anguish, that's easily one of the best of the year. Williams gets a much smaller role, but she makes a huge impression, and one scene in particular between her and Affleck in the later half of the movie would justify Oscars for both actors all by itself.Lonergan's screenplay doesn't make a false move. This film is largely about inarticulate people trying to process extremely complicated emotions, and they remain inarticulate -- they don't suddenly express their feelings in nicely phrased speeches in order to bring the film to tidy resolutions. The movie's final point, that broken people sometimes just stay broken no matter how badly others want them to have a happy ending, is certainly not uplifting, but there's something refreshing about how bracingly honest it is.Grade: A",Manchester by the Sea,4034228
9,maxvanstraelen,An admirable film for the whole drama-genre,9/10,1 April 2020,"Rarely there is a film these days to come out of Hollywood that is so humane, realistic and straight to the point. Though it feels a little bit overdone at times, the performances and subtle writing made 'Manchester by the Sea' a drama of craftsmanship.While many don't like it because it doesn't 'hit home', I like it just for that reason, cause it does 'hit home' in a way. The story is told in a way that happens exclusively in the real world, without escaping to some universe all the time. It's a tale of mourning, loss and pain. It could just happen to you. See, that's what gives 'Manchester by the Sea' it's relatability and humanity.

10,bardia-moose,and the Oscar for Best Actor goes to...,9/10,16 September 2016,"After the sudden death of his older brother, Lee, played by Casey Affleck, is made legal guardian of his son Patrick. He then returns to his hometown and is forced to deal with a tragic past that separated him from his family and the community he was born and raised in.Kenneth Lonergan is such an extraordinary and talented writer; his beautifully, and richly, textured drama draws upon the timeless themes of recovery, redemption, and the persistence of guilt in such a way that feels fresh. The emotion is never overbearing for the sake of being overbearing, rather it feels all too real, which is a credit to the writing as much as it is to the fantastic performances. This is the 'Casey Affleck show' from beginning to end; you can just give him the 'Best Actor' Oscar right now and save everyone a whole lot of trouble. He radiates this aura of subtle magnetism so brilliantly and effortlessly; there's not a single emotion on the spectrum that goes unexploited. As much as the film is about Lee and his internal journey from tragedy to something a lot more hopeful, it's also about his nephew, played by Lucas Hedges, who has a very bright future, and his personal struggle to cope with his father's death. Despite having a small yet significant part in the film, Michelle Williams' performance is a treasure to behold. There's one scene, in particular, where she got everyone in attendance wishing they brought a tissue. Unlike many big-budget studio movies, MANCHESTER BY THE SEA is not afraid to make the audience work and test the viewer's patience with its constant, and unannounced, cutting between past and present, as well as its unwavering unravelling of character background and motivation. In fact, one of its best aspects is the lack of close-ups. Almost everything is filmed from afar, which reflects Lee's emotional distancing. And it's not until later where you finally find out why this guy has detached himself from the rest of the world. Then, from that point on, you're in his head; you watch the film unfold from a point-of-view almost entirely foreign to how you viewed it at first. Regardless of the second half's slackening pace and film's familiar DNA, this is without a doubt the most personal and heart wrenching film of 2016 thus far. Maybe even the best.",Manchester by the Sea,4034228

12,trevor-82944,The Most Real Film of the Year,9/10,2 December 2016,"A man and a boy, one an uncle, one a nephew, are engaged in an intimate fishing lesson off the lake on Manchester, Connecticut. This melodic view takes us from here through the uncle's cold spiritual journey of knowing his place amidst the chaos of death.Manchester by the Sea is written and directed by Kenneth Lonergan (Gangs of New York), whose hard work shows in how deep he is willing to dive into the darkest corners of everyone we meet throughout his record of memories. The lonely, depressed, recently divorced plumber we are invited to connect with has a lot coming at him; having lost his brother to cardiac arrest, and now left to be the only one left to take in custody of his now fatherless nephew.From watching the heartbreaking flashbacks that depict the uncertainty of the plumber's path, to the humbling, somber performance by Casey Affleck (no tears necessary), all audiences suited for the well- earned R-rating will be greatly moved by its rough depiction of an everyday story within an everyday life.What makes the chilling power of this deceptively simple story so powerful is the consistently cold feel that Lonergan maintains from start to finish. Being set in the northeast, snow appears all over to reflect the plumber's state of mind, and the cold is felt all the greater depending on the amount of stress tugging between him and his blood relatives. The screen's empty starkness takes its time to linger on the quietest of moments, screaming the loudest of internal noises without saying a word.Manchester by the Sea could have easily taken place anywhere in the world, not necessarily in one particular small town in one particular part of the nation. What makes the Boston-Manchester setting work to its advantage is its subtle handling of the culture, right down to the look, feel, and taste of the area. The much-needed emphasis on father and son bonding through the quietness of fishing bookends the film with the one single image that defines everything valued by the people who live there. Also similar to last year's big Oscar-winner Spotlight, there is a clear presence of Catholicism guiding the lives of all Bostonians, whether or not they consider themselves religious. They claim that all Catholics are Christian, which is not entirely true, nor is it said so in the feature, but it works to the advantage of making the sense of hope they seek after touch much closer to home.There are plenty of independent features out there that tackle the discomforting subject of family death and custody, but none of them handle it with the same level of detail, humanity, and personal application as Manchester by the Sea. It's not the feel-good holiday treat you may be looking for at this time of the year, but considering how family and tragedy essentially go hand-in-hand, Lonergan's scholarly study on the personal crisis will help countless others in what to do about a similar trauma.Hence, I encourage all to see this masterful, humbling work when they get the chance to, but not just with anyone, with the relatives they are the closest to. That way, you can walk out of the theater together sharing the tears of your worst and best memories. If more movies had the power to do that, then Hollywood would at last be restored to its former glory.",Manchester by the Sea,4034228
13,ThomasDrufke,Masterful Acting on Display,9/10,2 December 2016,"If it wasn't already clear with films like Gone Baby Gone, Out of the Furnace, Ain't Them Bodies Saints, or The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, Casey Affleck is a world class actor. I've always found his work to be incredibly compelling, considering he doesn't promote himself as much as other acclaimed actors. Perhaps no performance of his is as impressive as the one in Manchester by the Sea.I find it difficult sometimes to sit down for a movie that I know is depressing and tackles tough subject matter. But I usually come out of it thankful that I saw the film anyway. That was certainly the case with this one. Casey Affleck plays Lee Chandler, who is forced to be the guardian of his nephew after his father passes away. Affleck, Michelle Williams, and maybe even Lucas Hedges deserve some recognition come awards season. There are a few similarities to this and a film from earlier this year, The Light Between Oceans. Both deal with tragedy and how/if a family can recover from that. But Manchester by the Sea chose the more effective route of storytelling by not shoving emotions down the audience's throat. Even coming from someone who likes The Light Between Oceans, the more effective directing style would be to let the emotions come out naturally. Kenneth Lonergan's directing in this film is nothing short of sensational. The film takes its time and lets character dynamics and roles play out so that when the time comes to push emotion to the forefront, it's warranted.Lonergan's unique style also showed in the calmer moments as well. In tragedy, we often don't think about all the little tasks you have to do after someone dies, to keep things afloat. Figuring out funeral arrangements, calling everyone, the food arrangements, or even the car rides to and from the hospital are all things Lonergan devoted time to. And it only added to the realness, which in turn made the film all the more heartbreaking. I don't cry easily in movies, but when actor's performances transcend the screen and bring you along with their emotional journey, it's hard to hold back. Affleck and Hedges hold a great comradery and bond, even through turmoil, but it was Williams and Affleck that destroyed me. Williams doesn't get a ton of screen time, but there's one particular scene with Affleck that was just devastating. Everything in the film was leading towards that moment and it cemented the film among the best of this year.Manchester by the Sea is not an easy watch, and Lonergan doesn't pull any punches in his directing. But if you love great acting and a well- thought out script, than this is the feature to keep any eye out this awards season. I'm glad Casey Affleck is finally getting his due, his performance of a man trying to close himself out of all the grief, is astounding. It may be the best performance of the year.+Affleck & Williams are heartbreaking+Lonergan's style uniquely suits this story+Doesn't force emotion, but when it hits, it hits.9.3/10",Manchester by the Sea,4034228
14,ferguson-6,A gem on grief and sorrow,9/10,23 November 2016,"Greetings again from the darkness. Grief. When a loved one dies, we experience a sorrow that is impossible to define. It can take on many different looks through various stages. When Lee Chandler (Casey Affleck) receives a phone call, he rushes back to his hometown, but arrives at the hospital too late to say goodbye to his big brother whose years-long battle with heart disease has ended abruptly. It's at this point that we begin to realize there is more to Lee's daily disquiet than we had realized in his early scenes as an apartment complex janitor.This is director Kenneth Lonergan's third directorial effort (You Can Count on Me, Margaret) and in each, death plays a crucial role. Mr. Lonergan is also a renowned playwright and screenwriter (Gangs of New York, Analyze This, Analyze That), and here he displays an incredible feel for humor and sarcasm amidst the ominous presence of gloom.If you aren't yet scared off, you will be rewarded with one of the most outstanding films of the year, and one of the best ever on-screen portrayals of grief. Casey Affleck embodies Lee as the broken man ‚Äì a tortured soul who doesn't blame himself for the unspeakable tragedy that destroyed his life, yet neither can he forgive himself. As penance, he has basically dropped out of society and moved to Quincy, where he lives in a dumpy apartment simply trying to survive each day shoveling snow and fixing leaky faucets. It's his way of not facing the present while avoiding the memories that haunt him in his hometown.The death of big brother Joe (Kyle Chandler) forces Lee to return to Manchester and handle the endless details of arrangements. He then learns that Joe's will states that Lee is to take over guardianship of 16 year old Patrick (Lucas Hedges). As we learn from flashbacks, Lee and Patrick long ago bonded as Uncle/Nephew. Things are much different now ‚Äì not just for Lee, but also for Patrick. He's a popular athlete, musician and high school lothario ¬Ö seemingly unwilling to accept the change brought about by the death of his father, and the long ago abandonment by his unstable mom (Gretchen Mol).The flashbacks serve as the reference as to how this family and these relationships reached this point in time. We also see the devastating event that crushed Lee's soul and left him unrecognizable from the one time life of the party, and doting husband and father. It also explains his approach to his unwanted duties in finishing brother Bob's job raising Patrick, and why much of the town treats Lee as a pariah.In addition to the brilliant writing and wonderful cinematography (Jody Lee Lipes), it's the highest level of acting that elevates this film to the level of extraordinary. Ms. Mol and Mr. Chandler are joined in the supporting cast by Matthew Broderick as Ms. Mol's evangelical husband, CJ Wilson as Bob's former friend and partner, and Michelle Williams as Randi, Lee's ex-wife. It seems like we have watched Lucas Hedges grow up on screen through the years, and he really nails the surprisingly complex role of Patrick. As terrific as all of these actors are, it's Affleck who redefines grief and sorrow and pain. In fact, the single scene towards the end when Affleck and Williams meet by happenstance, is so powerfully acted that it alone should garner nominations for each. It's a gut-wrenching scene that tells us sometimes reconciliation is just not possible.This is a heavy drama set in a cold environment with hard people ‚Äì at least on the outside. It's not the typical Boston blue collar drama, but rather more the psychology of being a man. There is enough humor to prevent the weight from being too much on viewers, and Lonergan pokes a bit of fun at the Massachusetts accent by tossing in arguments about Star Trek and sharks, and a scene about parking the car. The diverse music of Handel, Dylan, and Ella Fitzgerald somehow complements the mournful Lee ¬Ö the Humpty Dumpty of Manchester ‚Äì unable to be put back together again. It's certainly one of the gems of the year.",Manchester by the Sea,4034228
15,Bob-562,See It for Affleck!,9/10,6 January 2017,"In spite of a most annoying & pretentious score, this was a very moving film--actually a mouth-gaping appreciation of Casey Affleck. He carries the film, along with the actor playing his brother, Michelle Williams, & his nephew. Some scenes early on seem to plod on, and the pivotal scene of Affleck's past (that will forever haunt him) is reconstructed by voice-over rather than __seeing__ the evidence, which becomes a little disconcerting, considering how important it is. I was really impressed by Affleck's character, who seemed incapable of enjoying anything in his life. His alcoholism is palpable, as well as his violence, but he plays a wholly realized character--infinitely better than he did in ""Gone Baby Gone."" I hope he wins an Oscar for this role: I've never seen him better. And Michelle Williams is wonderful, especially in a near-conclusion confrontation with Affleck: that alone is Oscar-worthy. It's beautifully shot in the actual Manchester-by-the-Sea, and it's definitely worth seeing.

16,samkan,Terribly Overrated,5/10,17 December 2016,"I'm not a snob out to distinguish himself from the 97% Rotten Tomato ravers. I was just really disappointed walking out of the theatre. I don't know if I've ever seen a more self indulgent domestic weepy. The film sets the viewer up with mountains of spoon-fed plot tragedy and setback and then mines every last drop of melodrama and tears out of such. Affleck's character is a flawless, blameless Everyman and behaves so heroic it becomes impossible to feel for his plight. Williams is terrific but barely on screen for ten minutes. What apparently is intended to pass as compelling real-life dialog quickly becomes mundane and boring. Likewise, our younger protagonist is a teenage lothario having far too good a time to be awarded compassion. The non- Hollywood ending comes across as pretentious, though it certainly comes as a relief.",Manchester by the Sea,4034228

18,Red-125,Some psychological wounds don't heal,10/10,15 December 2016,"Manchester by the Sea (2016) was written and directed by Kenneth Lonergan.Casey Affleck stars as Lee Chandler, a janitor in Quincy, Massachusetts. (Quincy is about 1/2 hour away from Boston.) It's a dead-end job, Lee isn't well-liked by the tenants, and his primary pastime appears to be going into bars and getting into fights.Early in the film, we learn about the death of Lee's brother, who lives in Manchester by the Sea, Massachusetts. (Manchester by the Sea is a small seacoast town near Gloucester.) This leaves his 16-year-old son, Lee's nephew Patrick (Lucas Hedges), without a guardian. (Patrick's mother is gone.) Everyone assumes that Lee will quit his job in Quincy, come back to Manchester by the Sea, get a job there, and take care of his nephew.People know that Lee has had a terrible trauma in his life, but they don't perceive that this trauma has broken him psychologically. We learn that this is not a mental wound that can be healed. He's broken and, apparently, will never get better.The rest of the movie consists of flashbacks to earlier events, alternating with the present-time events taking place day to day. The movie is so well crafted that it's hard to know where it will go and how it will end. Director Lonergan doesn't hint about what will happen on the next day, let alone the next week. This keeps us, in the audience, spellbound and really eager to see what comes next.Often, a film rests on the shoulders of the protagonist. In this movie, Casey Affleck is so good that the film could, indeed, rest on his shoulders. However, that's not necessary, because Lucas Hedges does a superb job as Lee's nephew, and the supporting cast members are excellent.In addition--although it's hard to describe--the movie just looks right. The hospital staff, the people in the bar, the people in the police station, the people in the dockyard and in the garage all look as if they belong there, and weren't just brought in to appear in their scene and then go home.As I write this review, Manchester by the Sea has an incredible 8.5 IMDb rating. This puts it at the same level as Gladiator and Apocalypse Now. I think it deserves this rating, and I expect the movie to move into IMDb's top 100 films, and stay there for the foreseeable future.The film will work well enough on the small screen, but the large screen will be better. We saw Manchester by the Sea at Rochester's excellent Little Theatre. On a weekend in mid-December, 2016, the Little was screening three films with IMDb ratings over 8. My compliments to the programmers at the Little for making such great movies available to those of us who don't live in NYC, Chicago, or LA.",Manchester by the Sea,4034228
19,rockman182,Manchester By The Sea (2016),8/10,13 December 2016,"Kenneth Lonergan is a name that I didn't recognize because I've never seen any of his work. So basically for me, this film came out of the blue. Its getting early award buzz especially for Casey Affleck in the lead role. And I've got to say, its well deserved. The film is shot in and around Massachusetts, which genuinely looks beautiful in the film. Even the scenes involving winter just looked so gorgeous, serene, and real. Real is a word I think springs to mind for this film because its so genuine and just seems like an everyday story of a guy you might know. Affleck is a great actor, I enjoy a lot of his work. There was no way I was going to be let down by his performance. Its so effortless; Affleck just embodies the role of a distant loner of a man who is surrounded by grief. New responsibilities come upon him with the death of his brother. He isn't just haunted by this event in the present but also by harrowing events of his past. Affleck's Lee Chandler gets a character study that never tries to be overbearing with its emotion. Yet there's pain in his eyes throughout the film.Lonergan uses flashbacks throughout the film, which seems to be a popular (yet prosperous) form of storytelling. Events of Chandler's past are intertwined with the present. The film does enough of a job of showing why this troubled, down out of luck man, is overcome by the tragic circumstances of his life. Michelle Williams is not in this film for long but she is great in a spectacular scene with Affleck in its third act. Even Lucas Hedges is great in the film. Hedges and Affleck's interactions bring the humor in what should be an otherwise dark film (but it really isn't). Without spoiling anything, there are two scenes that pack a punch and they both are very short. I don't think this film treads any brand new ground but it does what it needs to do and it does it very well. I've been wrong about Oscar predictions in the past but surely Affleck is the frontrunner for Best Actor.8/10",Manchester by the Sea,4034228
20,Ramascreen,Perfect in every way,10/10,12 November 2016,"MANCHESTER BY THE SEA is perfect in every way. A film that's as emotionally powerful as it is exquisitely shot. Casey Affleck and Michelle Williams are phenomenal. Young talent Lucas Hedges is a must-see. Oscar nominated writer/director Kenneth Lonergan's way of capturing the struggling working class of America comes from a genuine place.Oscar nominee Casey Affleck plays a solitary Boston janitor, Lee Chandler, who returns to his hometown after the death of his older brother in order to take care of his teenage nephew, Patrick (Lucas Hedges). Lee is very reluctant about taking on this new responsibility because he's already overwhelmed as it is living from paycheck to paycheck, in addition to being haunted by a certain past tragedy that separated him from his wife, Randi (Michelle Williams).Casey Affleck originally came from Massachusetts, from this story's neck of the woods, so he brings a lot of himself and his familiarity with the region into his character. The film shows us small town USA, it shows us a fishing village, it shows us a place with long tradition, a way of living that's been handed down from generation to generation. So the region itself plays a very integral supporting role in MANCHESTER BY THE SEA. If you understand that, then you'll understand the characters.What I love about this film is how funny and how poignant it is in its approach to explaining to us the importance family, community, sacrifice and adjusting to life after so much has been taken from you. When Lee suffered a loss, his brother was there. When his brother dies, he takes care of his brother's son. There's no escaping that, but you can just see everybody in that community just starts pulling their weight and pitching in voluntarily, you don't see much of that anymore, unfortunately, these days. And throughout the film, Lonergan wants to show us that that sense of having each other's backs is not yet instinct and he does it in a way that's honest. Even the arguments between Lee and Patrick, yes you'll laugh at their trying to make it work but at the same time you're kinda glad that they at least are arguing, in their own awkward way, they're communicating. Great performances by all the actors involved, I can't say enough to praise Affleck, Williams, and Hedges. MANCHESTER BY THE SEA is an example of strength in simplicity.-- Rama's Screen --",Manchester by the Sea,4034228

22,sol-,By the Sea,6/10,11 August 2017,"Placed in charge of his teen nephew after his brother passes away, a morose handyman confronts inner demons and reevaluates his life in this downbeat drama starring Casey Affleck. The film gets off to a solid start as we witness Affleck's humdrum existence and the moody residents who he has to deal with. As the film progresses though, it adopts a stream of consciousness narrative style, flipping back and forth between Affleck's memories and the present day as he processes his brother's death and his new role in his nephew's life. This provides an emotional wallop at one point as we discover just what happened to his doting daughters, but generally speaking, the flipping back and forth in time is unhelpful, subtracting from the immediacy of the drama unfolding. The film also grows repetitive as the same issues are debated between uncle and nephew time and time again. There are some really good touches late in the piece though (Affleck imaging his daughters; a confrontation with Michelle Williams) and the entire project is shot with thought and consideration; the way Affleck is only ever visible in the background when we first see the grown-up nephew at an ice rink works very well. Still, it is hard not to expect a little more from an Oscar winning film and though solid a movie as it is, it would be interesting to see the film play out in chronological order instead.",Manchester by the Sea,4034228
23,quinimdb,Manchester by the Sea,10/10,9 December 2016,"""Manchester by the Sea"" is an amazing character study of a man dealing with guilt and loss. It is pretty depressing, but also comedic at times and its final shot is relatively hopeful. While the film and its characters may seem simple at first glance, they are layered and complex underneath.Casey Affleck, one of the most underrated actors working today, is Lee Chandler, a lonely and broken down man, far away from the people he loved. He works as a janitor and has constant contact with people, but can't truly connect with anyone. He returns to his hometown when his brother dies, and in his will it says that Lee must take care of his son, Patrick, played well by Lucas Hedges. The film tracks the way that both Patrick and Lee cope with the loss and how their relationship grows.The cinematography and editing in the film are subtle and impressive, with the way scenes are cut together adding emotional impact or depth to the characters. The juxtaposition of two scenes can make a point about a character, and the way certain scenes are edited can show the internal struggle of a character. The cinematography also conveys different layers of Lee, such as Lee's disconnect from the people in his life. For instance, in the scene in which Lee confronts his ex- wife again, his wife is standing on the left side of the screen and he is standing on the right side. In the background on the left side, there is a dark wall, while the background on the right side is very light, showing a clear divide between the two characters.Much like ""Moonlight"", my favorite film of the year so far, this film is a visually impressive, emotionally involving, subtle, very well edited, and powerfully acted character study. The progression of each character is very realistic. The characters don't suddenly get better, because life doesn't work that way. There are no sudden moments of understanding or epiphany, there is just the hint of hope underneath all of their guilt and grief. However, they also don't just mope and whine the whole time. They do try to get away from their grief, and they try to form connections, and they try to move on. But, in the end, it just isn't that easy.",Manchester by the Sea,4034228
24,preppy-3,Too slowly paced and overly familiar,2/10,6 December 2016,"Lee Chandler (Casey Affleck) is a janitor in Quincy living in a one-room place with no friends and a serious attitude problem. His brother Joe (Kyle Chandler) who lives in Manchester-by-the-Sea dies leaving behind a rebellious 16 year old (Lucas Hedges). In his will he appoints Lee as his guardian--but Lee can barely take care of himself. What to do? There are some good things about this film. It looks beautiful (it was shot on location), has great acting by the entire cast and has a pretty good script. Where this drops the ball is the ridiculously slow pace (there's no need for this film to run over two hours) and an overly familiar story. There are many scenes that go on for far too long and introduce characters and situations that add nothing to the story. This movie seems to think it's saying something deep and meaningful but it's not. This story has been done before and this movie adds nothing to it. The ultimate resolution was so utterly predictable I actually got insulted. There are a few affecting moments but they're lost in this dull mess. Also Michelle Williams is here but (despite being second billed) she's hardly in it. She does have an incredible scene with Affleck towards the end that has Oscar written all over it. It's frustrating because there's a really good movie here but the overlength works against it.",Manchester by the Sea,4034228
25,rowanuk,Beautifully melancholic,10/10,7 January 2017,"These type of films don't come around that often, and for good reason. It takes focus and effort to come up with stories and themes that touch deeper than the usual Hollywood dirge. The story-line is completely unpredictable , unlike 95% of the films out there.What is most intriguing about M B T S , is the way in which highly depressing themes are kept in check with humour, intelligent scripting and a subtle feel good factor, which seems to creep in at exactly the right time. The overall feel is also kept balanced by the intricacies of the relationships between various characters. Affleck has taken his game to the next level , his character and mannerisms are completely believable -he is submerged into type.As a couple of mid 40 somethings, we grew tired of the typical film genres some years ago. We long for films like this, and having seen many of the nominated films for this year (bafta), this one is by far the clear leader. Hacksaw ridge is just another glorification of war, predictable, overly violent and boring, silence is good OK but not special and the list goes on. Manchester by the sea deserves recognition for standing out in a sea of mediocrity",Manchester by the Sea,4034228
26,ironhorse_iv,This movie about trying to keep your head above water is somewhat over drowning in misery. It will be hard to beat.,7/10,2 May 2020,"For a picture who's titled is supposed to represent a relaxing location full of scenic beaches and vista points. 'Manchester by the Sea' is truly a grim watch. Written and directed by Kenneth Lonergan, the film tells the story of Lee Chalder (Casey Affleck) a depressed man being asked to take care of his teenage nephew Patrick (Lucas Hedges) after the boy's father Joe (Kyle Chandler) falls ill. Without spoiling this movie too much, the series of inserted semi unannounced nonlinearly flashbacks can be a bit confusing and annoying. Especially when the sequence goes a little too long such as Lee talking to Joe's lawyer about the guardianship. It's very awkward to see Chalder's mind drift off while looking out of the window with the long pause of no interrupting dialogue. It seemed somewhat a clich√©s way to cut to a very long flashback about what happen to his own children long ago. The whole past exposition dump with the police really add to the length that I nearly forgot what was happening presently. Along those lines the beautiful music from composer Lesley Barber that goes with it is very angelic loud, to the point that it's ear piercing. It's felt very forceful preachy and gimmicky at times. Don't get wrong not all the flashbacks dramatic effects are bad. I kinda like the slow motion far distance wide cinematography shots with muted people talking in the background. It felt somewhat dream or nightmare like as if feeling disconnected and alone. An out of the body experience. As for current day; most of it was also well shot. I love how the location is framed with everything looking so cold and dead due to the winter months when Lee arrives back in Manchester. It reminds him so much of the fatherhood, soul mate and human connection that he lost over the years. Then how the city is framed during the spring month where everything is thawing. It represented the character slowly overcoming his grief in order to find his humanity again. The visuals are far clearer and stronger to understand than any of the dialogue being said. I mean that. Characters are constantly sounding inarticulate. It doesn't help that the thin Boston accent with the slangs is equally hard to understand at times. I get that they were going for realism in order to show Lee's sense of awkwardness and difficultly in reconnecting with others but gees it was somewhat irritating even with the humor. It takes forever for people to speak the simplest of little things. I know that a lot of people are giving Affleck a lot of praise, but the truth is; I found his acting not that special. Casey here is pretty much playing his standard role: the not much for words somewhat selfish jerk to some degree sympathetic recluse full of self-pity. I felt I was watching 2006 'Lonesome Jim' yet again. Regardless of my opinion, I didn't mind his Oscar win. While, I get that the decision to give Affleck the award has caused controversy due to the sexual harassment allegations brought against him in 2010, but let's note that the award is based on an actor's performance in a film, not if they were a good person in their personal life. As for the supporting cast. Michelle Williams as Randi, Lee's ex-wife was really good. That scene on the street where Lee & her character talk about the blame and the grief of their own personal loses was compelling as hell. You can really tell that Randi feels guilt for the way she treated him and desperately wants to apologize so Lee can regain some semblance of a life again. It's very powerful. It's kinda sucks that Williams is only in ten minutes of the film. I really thought she would be in more scenes; seeing that Michelle is on the movie's poster. Regardless most of the supporting cast screen time is spent with Hedges. He was fine as Patrick despite the character having subplots that felt like filler such as dealing with his awful multiple relationships. I really couldn't care less about those selfish actions. Nevertheless, I'm not going to freak out over frozen chicken as I found the subplot of the son trying to reunited with his mother Elise (Gretchen Mol) somewhat compelling even if Matthew Broderick's comedic appearance as the fianc√© Jeffrey did took some viewers out of the film. It was very interesting. I also love the subplot of Lee & Patrick having to find money to fix Joe's boat. Despite the odd Deux Ex Machina with expensive collection of guns solution, I kinda dig the metaphor of them trying to fix their relationship and hold something that can remind them of good times with the family. After all that's what Joe's last act was about. It was an attempt to have Lee reengage with the world. That's what the movie should be about not about the kid can get laid. At least that was the ideas that producer Matt Damon & John Krasinski wanted. Thank goodness they kept that and cut the whole CGI whale scene idea. That would had been cheesy. Overall: This movie is certainly not a popcorn flick. It feels more like a character study and like that should be examine. In spite of the movie leaning toward a more cynical end. Many of the themes about seeking closure for past mistakes and dealing with loss are very relatable. It's worth checking out in Minnetonka, Minnesota and elsewhere.",Manchester by the Sea,4034228
27,bkrauser-81-311064,Complexity Through Simplicity,9/10,26 August 2017,"Manchester by the Sea is at once, one of the best movies of the year and one of the most challenging to recommend. It knocks on the door of greatness by virtue of approaching its subject matter with uncommon sincerity and grace. Yet that subject matter - a concentrated dose of grief in all its uncomfortable bitterness, can't help but feel painfully real. I suppose in the strongest of terms one could say Manchester by the Sea isn't so much a movie. It's more of a human experience.Humanity itself is startlingly realized in the funereal grimace of Lee Chandler (Affleck), whose own brush with personal tragedy has left him adrift in Quincy, Massachusetts. He keeps to himself as an apartment complex handyman, avoiding all meaningful human contact almost as a form of penance. So when his older brother Joe (Chandler) looses his struggle with congestive heart failure, Lee is put in the uncomfortable position of returning to his home town and having to wrestle with the complex emotions it evokes. Shortly before the funeral he reacquaints himself with his seventeen-year- old nephew Patrick (Hedges) who is suddenly left in his charge by the order of Joe's will. ""I'm sorry, I assumed Joe had discussed this with you,"" says the lawyer. ""No he didn't. No, he didn't."" Each reiteration loaded with anguish.The film is laden with tiny moments like the one above; short, affecting and scintillating with unwieldy levels of feeling. Sometimes those emotions are so tightly knotted in the characters personal story that they apex in simple anger and panic. Yet since we know where those emotions are coming from, we automatically identify them even when we can't describe them - complexity through simplicity. In one scene the self-assured Patrick is beguiled by frozen chicken and a silent house into a panic attack. The scene, taken out of context is austere and simple yet loaded with prior knowledge, the simple sequence of events proves emotionally devastating on all counts.So too are the scenes involving Lee's ex-wife Randi (Williams) who's all-too-brief appearance proves poignant, tender and devastating in equal measure. Her dignity and quiet grace bristles with Lee's more turbulent expressions of grief yet her tenderness doesn't so much pour out as it trickles in a tactful display of beautiful, beautiful mercy. Her fate has certainly diverged from that of Lee but despite what we may think of our characters' choices, there's no filling the void in their heart.In that measure, Manchester by the Sea is an uncalculable success, if for no other reason that it explores the way humans of all stripes deal with their grief. Writer/Director Kenneth Lonergan seems to understand humans in ways few do. Every word, every tiny micro-expression, every droll interruption of unexpected humor viciously stirs all those negative emotions we rather not face. He then provides no easy answers but rather allows you to sit in on his small little drama, soak in the quiet homily urging patience, love and understanding and lets it all sink in. Manchester by the Sea is undeniably hard to sit through but damned if it doesn't make you a better person for watching it.",Manchester by the Sea,4034228

The reviews for it on IMDB also are mostly positive...so I expected to like the movie but really didn't. It isn't that the movie is terrible...but I found it difficult to like as well.The film is about the lives of folks, particularly the uncle (Casey Affleck) and his nephew (Lucas Hedges), following the death of the boy's father. However, for me, I had a hard time caring because the characters were so incredibly unlikable. Now I like that the story was about working class folks...but the film makes it seem like all these people are lowlifes. They drink, curse constantly and just aren't nice folks. You feel sorry for them that bad stuff happens to them...but after a while I stopped caring.Overall, I am glad many people liked the film...but I just found it unpleasant and uninvolving from start to finish. Technically, it's reasonably well made (though I disliked the way the flashback scenes were integrated, or, not integrated into the plot)...but I just find it hard watching a film where I didn't like anyone.

Shoveling snow one minute and bad news the next, oh so cold. Chandler's brother dies and he learns that he has been named in the will as his 16-year-old nephew's guardian. Whoa, that wasn't discussed. Chandler doggedly fulfills obligations despite being enmeshed in a sea of troubles. Something has happened to him that everyone knows and no one talks about, the proverbial elephant not just in the room, but everywhere.Despite those rocky first impressions, Affleck reveals Chandler to be quite even tempered in the main, often quite reticent and circumspect almost to mesmerizing effect, I felt a certain Brando-esque appeal there (without the mumbling). Affleck gives Chandler a quiet nobility and courage that emanates from the sheer act of facing up. Affleck won Best Actor for this.

The first is that when you experience it for the first time, the emotional sweep of it all, how Kenneth Lonergan's script and by proxy his direction with this wonderful cast (some I'd think not all professional, but most of them are of course) goes between high drama and comic touches in the dialog, you get that part of it and it makes it such a rich film overall. But the second time I found I was paying even closer attention to the little details and moments, how Lonergan was fully building up these moments piece by piece, to show how a life is lived by people, whether it's Casey Affleck's Lee or Lucas Hedges' Patrick, or in those small moments with Michelle Williams and Gretchen Mol (Kyle Chandler might seem to get the short shrift, but hey, you got to have one fundamentally decent and straightforward man in this narrative).Manchester by the Sea is all about life's little moments, and if it wasn't 'about' its main scenario, which is that Uncle Lee has to return to possibly, maybe, could-be the new guardian to nephew Patrick after his father's (somewhat) sudden death, I think this world would still be enjoyable to watch in the way a Seinfeld episode would be to watch: we like being around these characters and how the relate to one another, whether it's Patrick and his teenage friends talking Star Trek, or Lee in his... well, sure, he is a dark and depressed man following the colossal tragic mistake from his past that cost him a lifetime. Maybe it's not the strongest example, but what I'm getting at is that Lonergan is more concerned with those little thing that people do and that we all have in common - we're so in our own heads that we forget where the car is, or, even, a paramedic can't quite get those leg-thingies up right away to put the person into the ambulance - those moments that are so small we barely ever talk about them.Because all of those moments of behavior and character between people like Lee or Patrick or Lee and Michelle Williams's Randi (she's not in the film too much but when she is she makes her presence felt like an earthquake) are believable, because we feel like we can be in this world with these characters, the drama is so profuse it sometimes feels like the film won't be able to contain it. It's a film with lots of quiet moments so that when things must become BIG, when we see tragedy strike and the outcome from that, or when two characters meet again on a street and both come to tears over past wounds that can never heal, they make an operatic impact. Lonergan did that with a profundity that was teetering on becoming too bombastic, too operatic, but it didn't get there. Here in Manchester I feel like he's perfected what he's been going for in his features.I may have neglected the actors. Did I? OK - everyone is terrific here, with Hedges sort of the break-out star, but naturally Affleck commands often by downplaying moments so that when he has to act Lee's almost surprised by what he does (i.e. when he bursts through a door to comfort, in his way, a crying Patrick), and of course Williams is top of her career here again. I can't recommend this enough for people looking for a soulful, powerful drama about people having to live their lives despite/because of/regarding tragedy, and whether they suffer through it or overcome it, they're always people we can connect with. Yes, even with the Massachussets accents on parade.",Manchester by the Sea,4034228
32,eddie_baggins,A real film filled with a quiet and haunting power,9/10,6 February 2017,"Filled with a quiet, haunting power that will only make itself wholly manifest long after the credits of Kenneth Lonergan's masterful study of grief, loss and love have rolled, Manchester by the Sea isn't ever the film you expect it to become but it's within these moments of surprise and unpredictability that the real genius of this truly poignant drama come bearing down upon the unsuspecting watcher.Originally developed by Matt Damon (who was set to star and direct but only stays on as producer here) and fellow actor John Krasiniski, Manchester was given to Lonergan whose previous film was the underseen and horrifically released Margaret, and saw the talented writer/director of You Can Count On Me at a crossroads in his career where it seemed as though the brilliant wordsmith was turning his sole focus into the theatre scene.We can be thankful Damon and Krasinski sought out Lonergan, as his ability to craft a believable and real human drama is at the forefront of this moving study of Casey Affleck's tormented maintenance man Lee Chandler, an examination that gives Lonergan the chance to slowly but methodically build up his tale and unlock the broken nature of its leading man played memorably by a career-best Affleck.So good in The Assassination of Jesse James and the underrated Gone Baby Gone, Ben Affleck's little brother showcases here an ample display of his talent to bring broken characters to vivid life. It's far from a showy performance; there are rarely moments designed for Affleck to do so but he finds power in the small details, the human details and when Lee shows signs of what lies within it's made all the more powerful thanks to Affleck's turn.Ably supported by impressive up and comer Lucas Hedges as Lee's nephew Patrick, the always great Michelle Williams as Lee's ex-wife Randi and the grounding presence of Coach Taylor himself Kyle Chandler as Lee's recently passed brother Joe, it's perhaps too close a race to suggest this year's Best Actor Oscar is Affleck's but regardless of him winning the golden statue or not, this is a career defining and memorable turn.A slow film that cares little for big moment's (even if the films one big set piece is worth its weight in emotional gold), Manchester by the Sea won't be everyone's cup of dramatic tea but Lonergan's film, that never molds or conforms itself into what's the usual for this type of fare or to what it's trailer's might make it seem to be, is a cinematic treat that will only grow on you as you ponder and consider it's many quiet yet resonant human qualities that feel far more real than is the Hollywood norm.4 1/2 troublesome drummers out of 5",Manchester by the Sea,4034228
33,tomgillespie2002,One of the finest films of the year,9/10,28 February 2017,"Writer/director Kenneth Lonergan hadn't made a movie for 11 years before Manchester by the Sea, a sombre drama that began to draw attention during a critically successful festival run. Receiving acclaim for You Can Count On Me back in 2000 before moving on to Margaret in 2005, the latter film spent five years in post- development hell due to a lack of budget and multiple lawsuits before limping into theatres in 2011. Such a frustrating experience would normally cause a director to fade into obscurity, but Lonergan has returned with a bang with one of the finest films of the year to prove that he is a film-maker of unfathomable potential.The withdrawn Lee Chandler (Casey Affleck) is a janitor working in Quincy, Massachusetts, spending his days fixing leaky pipes, taking out the garbage, shovelling snow, and generally taking whatever s**t the tenants of the apartment block he works in dishes out. Living in a tiny, one-bed room, Lee is quiet but prone to violent outbursts, spending most nights drinking away whatever sorrows rest on his shoulders and starting fights with anybody who looks at him the wrong way. One day, he receives a phone call and is informed that his brother Joe (Kyle Chandler, coincidentally sharing the same surname as his character) has suffered a heart attack. By the time he arrives in his hometown of Manchester-by-the-Sea, Joe has passed away, and Lee is tasked with arranging the funeral and putting his brother's affairs in place.I've admired Casey Affleck ever since I saw Good Will Hunting (1997) and later in his brother Ben's thrilling Gone Baby Gone (2007). But his performance in Andrew Dominik's The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford ultimately convinced me that he is one of the finest actors of his generation, and I felt that he deserved to beat the lauded Javier Bardem to the Oscar that year. Deservedly, he won Best Actor for his work here. It's a rare skill for an actor to be able to portray such a range of emotions when massively underplaying the part. Lee is as bottled-up as one can get, clearly reaching the point of just not giving a f**k anymore. When he returns to town, people whisper his name with both anger and sympathy. Something has happened to turn him into a socially- awkward, sullen shadow of a man, but Lonergan chooses to reveal the past slowly through flashbacks.In smaller roles, Chandler, Michelle Williams and Gretchen Mol are also as impressive as expected, but, Affleck aside, the majority of the screen-time is given to Lucas Hedges as Joe's son Patrick, who is now placed into the care of a reluctant Lee. Patrick doesn't react to his father's passing as one would expect, and instead remains a chirpy, outgoing teenager proud to have two girlfriends on the go. It's a lively, highly charismatic performance, and the complete opposite to the mopey young adult I was expecting. Themes of grief and regret run throughout the film, but the relationship between Lee and Patrick provides many moments of warmth and much- needed humour. Most writers would opt for award-baiting, tear- jerking moments of emotional outpouring, but Lonergan understands that life is rarely like that, and some wounds simply do not heal. The power of Manchester by the Sea lies within this honesty, with the windy, snowy backdrop acting almost as a window into its characters' souls.",Manchester by the Sea,4034228
34,lavatch,Manslaughter by the Sea is Unbearably Pretentious,1/10,22 February 2017,"A sign of a good film is that one wants to return to it over and over for repeated viewings. It is difficult to imagine many viewers who would wish to endure an encore performance of ""Manchester By the Sea.""Apparently, the goal of the filmmakers was to depict an American domestic tragedy. But all too often, the serious nature of the content is conflated with comedy. In the bonus segment of the DVD, it was made clear that writer-director Kenny Lonergan believes that all films should have a balance of tragedy and comedy. Unfortunately, he never found the right balance in ""Manchester By the Sea.""Take for instance the tasteless scene in the kitchen where the young nephew has a ""breakdown"" when he opens the freezer door and conflates the frozen chicken with the remains of his dead father, which are currently housed in a freezer. Or, what about the farcical scenes where the young man is attempting to have sex with his girlfriend and the girl's mother repeatedly knocks on the door? Or, what about the ridiculous barroom brawls where the specialty of Lee is the sucker punch for unsuspecting men. How is it that Lee is never prosecuted by the police? All too frequently, the serious drama is overwhelmed by scenes that are not credible. The result is that it is difficult to empathize with the characters.This problem is intensified by the ridiculous dialogue throughout the ""Manchester"" screenplay. The lines spoken by the actors have no connection with true-to-life dialogue. A cardiologist would never tell a patient, ""You have a bad disease."" Was this another Kenny Longeran attempt at comedy? In order to engage the audience, the film must draw on lifelike conversation. This never happened in the film. Somehow, the august members of the Academy honored ""Manchester by the Sea"" with the best original screenplay Oscar this year. The viewer can make up his or her mind as to whether the scripting was original or completely incompetent.Like so many indies, this film had pretensions of high art, as it contrasted idyllic scenes from New England with the sordid details of the lives of its inhabitants. The main character, Lee Chandler, who works as a handyman, is in conversation with a tenant, who casually recounts a story about one of his relatives, who went out to sea on a tuna boat and was never seen again. Michelle Williams, reprising her long-suffering character from ""Brokeback Mountain,"" apologizes to Lee for the horrible things she said to him. Supposedly, this is her ""big scene"" in the film. But we never hear what were those hurtful words, and we never learn what happened to the tuna boat. Once again, the scripting of this film is suspect.The question arises as to the nature of guilt on the part of Lee for the deaths of his children, following his negligence in not placing the screen in front of the fireplace. Once again, the movie clumsily mixes serious and comic styles, never providing a believable context for the viewer to become emotionally engaged. For example, Lee is given a free pass by the authorities for child endangerment, manslaughter, or possession of drugs on the night of the fire, just as he is never prosecuted for assault and battery on innocent bystanders whom he attacked in bars. He is even able to keep his job as a handyman after verbally assailing the apartment residents. Apparently, it is enough for the filmmakers to casually depict Lee's guilt in the superficial way that he tortures himself and those around him. As he confesses to his nephew, his only philosophical insight is ""I can't beat it."" That is not a terribly profound revelation, and ""Manchester By the Sea"" is not a terribly profound film.",Manchester by the Sea,4034228
35,mmoiyadi,Brilliant portrayal of a troubled soul,8/10,4 August 2017,"The best part about this movie is the emotional connection it establishes with the protagonist. You could actually feel for Lee Chandler (Casey Affleck in a truly Oscar worthy performance) when he tries to cope up with the tragedy that has destroyed him as a person. He is an emotionally distraught person yet he realizes the fact that he must continue to live, continue to take responsibility that he despises the most because of the tragedy that he has faced in his life, fighting his inner daemons to be a nice guardian to his nephew.Lee is a janitor working in Boston when he gets to know about the sudden death of his brother due to heart attack in Manchester which is also the place where Lee belongs. As per his brother's will Lee has to be the guardian of his 16 year old son. Lee is much reluctant to accept this responsibility despite the fact that he loves his nephew very much. How he accept the responsibility and finally gives in to every wish of his nephew, which includes moving to Manchester, a place he so despises due to the personal tragedy he has suffered forms the crux of the story. Initially it is hard to understand the erratic and reserved behavior of Lee considering his jovial nature from the pre-tragedy flashbacks but as soon as you get to know of the tragedy you completely change your thinking about Lee and your heart reaches out to him. The reason for this change is the way Lee is played by Casey Affleck. He makes the character his own and not once you feel like he is acting..no melodrama. Such a restrained performance yet conveying the frustration of the character beautifully to viewers is something not many actors can achieve. Full credits to him for such a brilliant portrayal. We get to hear a lot of stories about someone's struggle to achieve his or her dream by facing all difficulties, hardships and those stories then becomes a source of inspiration to those having similar dreams but are yet to achieve the same. But what about those who have no dreams or rather have lost the ability to dream, those whose past haunts them so much that a dream has no meaning in their life. All they have are nightmares. Clearly such stories does not inspire them. Then what is it that keeps them going? What are their struggles? Even if they hope to be caring to their loved ones, even if they live and survive for their well being, they must fight the past and it is this struggle which makes for a compelling viewing. These stories should also be a source of inspiration to those depressed souls with similar traumatic pasts and that is what this movie does brilliantly. In a way this movie reminded me of 'The pursuit of happiness' in terms of a man's struggle to survive and care for one's loved ones. But in this case it is not the outside world they are fighting but the world inside them.",Manchester by the Sea,4034228

It is a film rammed so full of emotion and despair that it will likely leave you speechless at the end.The plot was intense, with some very dark moments and themes, exploring loss and depression in very authentic and real ways. The script was expertly crafted, allowing us to delve into the characters and get to know their pain.Casey Affleck was truly astounding in his role as Lee. His performance will break you emotionally I have no doubt about it. There were so many different layers to his performance which were so affecting. The whole performance felt so real and powerful which elevated the piece to a whole new level.All of the performances were great, with very strong supporting turns from Michelle Williams and Lucas Hedges, but Affleck completely stole the show.The technical elements of the film were all fantastic.

For me, it's the best kind of story-telling: it's impossible to predict the turns it takes, but when they are taken they are completely plausible. Writer/director Kenneth Lonergan has done an exceptional job.Casey Affleck leads a superb cast with his amazing performance. A climactic scene between him and the ever-wonderful Michelle Williams is destined to become a classic.A word for Jody Lee Lipes' cinematography, which is beautiful, setting all the pain in the movie in the context of the shifting light of the eponymous small coastal town.There are a few flaws here and there, generated I think by editing less than perfectly matched reverse shots; and there is one sequence in which Lonergan takes a real risk with a famous piece of music -- for me it worked, but for others it may not. But this is nit-picking. I was so full of emotion by the end of this movie that I couldn't speak. That really hasn't happened for a long time.This is a film about real life.

38,dannylee-78082,I can't beat it,9/10,2 January 2023,"What does it mean to survive?Did you survive if you are still breathing but your soul is dead? If the answer is no, Lee Chandler (Casey Affleck) was definitely not a survivor in the beginning of the movie. He was very much ""dead inside"" living a mundane life with violent tendencies. So much that he hardly seemed shaken by his brother's death, who we learn that they had a rather close relationship. Seamlessly incorporating past memories or ""flashbacks"", the movie slowly unwraps why Lee is the way he is. Lee was afflicted by unimaginable trauma, bringing immense guilt and grief to the man as his mistake took the lives of his three young children, subsequently ending his marriage. To prevent the movie to be so dark and gloomy, the brilliant writing of Kenneth Lonergan gives the audience some comedic breaks throughout the movie in the newly developing relationship between Lee and his nephew, Patrick (Lucas Hedges). The fact that Patrick is one hell of a playboy and wants his uncle to be a set-up so he can have sex is very humorous indeed.Lee spends some time in Manchester trying to deal with the aftermath of his brother's death and caring for Patrick, who is also grief-stricken in different ways. Lee tries his best to help Patrick adjust to his new normal as his brother did in the past for him. And so the past and current experiences overlap. Though he tries to accommodate for his nephew, it quickly becomes clear that Manchester-by-the-Sea is no longer inhabitable for him due to his past. No matter how much time has passed, he still carries that around with him. But the most defining moments come from the final minutes of the film. Though Lee moves back to Boston, he looks for a place with an extra room so Patrick could visit. He also still goes fishing with him. This is a very different Lee from the one we saw in the beginning of the movie. Yes, he still has scars from his trauma, but he remains a survivor - his soul has been brought back to life through bonding with another man in grief. ""I can't beat it"", Lee says. He may have not won the war, but he lived another day to love despite all the love being sucked out of him.While what I wrote above is more the movie unpacked, I want to reiterate that it was an excellent work covering grief with masterful performances from Casey Affleck and in the key reunion moment with Randi (Michelle Williams). I loved that the movie had somewhat of a calm and quiet atmosphere when the subject was rather the opposite. The familiar cities of Massachusetts as a Boston resident made me feel closer to the movie emotionally. One day, I shall visit the city, relive the moments of this beautiful film, and keep surviving, like Lee did.",Manchester by the Sea,4034228
39,neverever121,"Lonergan's beautifully understated writing, and Affleck's stunning performance, create a powerhouse picture that will surely sweep awards",10/10,10 October 2016,"I was very pleased to snag a last minute returned, lone available ticket to the European premiere of this on Saturday as I'd heard a lot of great things about this film and it had been sold out.The premise is simple: when his brother Joe dies, Lee Chandler (Casey Affleck) is forced to take care of his teenage nephew in his hometown, from which he moved away years earlier to escape his demons from a trauma years earlier.It becomes clear early on that Lee had life figured out years earlier. The film jumps between the past and the present, revealing a time where Lee was married, spent a lot of time with his friends and family (especially his brother and his nephew) and was content with life. But while jumping between the two periods of time, the film travels along at a slow, tense pace, tentatively revealing facets of Lee's past and present personalities (which are remarkably different) before hitting the audience with the full force of what exactly what made him run from his hometown.Casey Affleck is astonishingly good and it's no wonder that there is a strong early buzz around his performance. He essentially plays two different characters, a man before trauma and a man after. The 'before' in flashbacks is fairly simple, a relatively friendly and happy-go-lucky guy who spends a lot of time with his friends and family, has a close relationship with his nephew, etc. But where he excels is in the quiet desperation of the present-day Lee Chandler. With this character there are only rare moments of outward emotion - but Affleck plays it so that it is painfully clear just how much hurt Lee is keeping inside. Best Actor Oscar nomination, and highly possible win, incoming.Despite the serious subject matter, there is a surprising warmth that permeates the film. This is a film primarily about a man forced to confront his demons, yes, but it is also a film about family and the ties that bind us to our hometown. There is a terrific chemistry between Affleck's Lee and Lucas Hedges, who plays his nephew Patrick. Make no mistake, despite its subject matter this film is often hilarious, with the dialogue between Lee and his nephew providing most of the frequent outbursts of laughter in the cinema. Owing to his detachment and fear, Lee is fairly useless as a caregiver to Patrick, who in turn pushes his limits in being allowed to do whatever he wants (mostly chasing girls - there are particularly hilarious scenes when he is trying to get laid).Affleck's Lee is also forced to confront his demons in the form of his now ex-wife Randi, played by the ever-brilliant Michelle Williams. It's actually a relatively small part, but a key one, with an especially important scene that is played beautifully by both Affleck and Williams. In the Q&A that took place before the film, Williams talked about how she had spent 15 years wanting to work with 'Kenny' Lonergan, the director, as he is such a beautiful writer, and so she jumped at the chance before she'd even really heard detail about the part. And it's clear to see why she would be so desperate to work with Kenneth Lonergan, whose writing and directing for this film is gentle, warm and heartbreaking in one package. It's bleak, but hints at hope. It's understated, but breaks out in small moments of agony without overdoing it (the middle of the film is particularly gut-wrenching). I would be very surprised not to see nominations in his direction also.Beautiful writing and directing from Kenneth Lonergan, and a stunning performance from Casey Affleck in particular. It's a beautiful, quiet picture encapsulating trauma, guilt, redemption and familial bonds.",Manchester by the Sea,4034228
40,aharmas,Pain by The Numbers,7/10,19 December 2016,"""Manchester by the Sea"" offers a good combination of elements that should have resulted in a much more interesting package. We have the story of a tortured soul who has to go back to his hometown and face the terrifying ghosts left behind by events that destroyed his life. The question is whether he will be able to survive this development or end up causing more tragedies before the 137 minutes are over.Casey Affleck plays the man who once had an average family with three children and a wife who he took for granted most of the time. It appears as if his life has always been a series of awful circumstances, some a result of his alcoholism; others are just some dark chapters who compound or revive the old wounds. One of the lone sources of spiritual support has now died ""unexpectedly"" leaving behind a nephew, entrusted to him. Unfortunately, this might be a task he's not ready to carry out because of many different factors.The origins of the lowest moments of his life are told in flashbacks, as we see how his various relationships were affected by his erratic behavior and his lack of self-control. He wasn't really able to maintain normal bonds with anybody around him. People tried, but he always managed to keep some distance between him and the others. Suddenly, he loses most of his family, and this time he becomes a target of people's recriminations and his own self-induced torture.We see Affleck mostly as a sad and angry man, a brooding creature who can barely handle his daily routine. For some strange reason, people put up with him; we can deduce that they know his background, and there's pity involved. Things take a worse turn when he's back in the middle of what he left behind. There are incredulous looks and very low expectations, maybe a wave of both resistance and frustration because this man is now in charge of another child, and the challenges are going to be big and intense. His nephew is 16 years old, barely knows him, and we don't know what will happen when emotions reach limits neither party will be able to handle.In the end, we see how people start getting used to each other, with some people never being able to overcome their perception of what he did in the past. Others are a bit more understanding, but people are almost never able to learn or change, and everything is a step away from escalating into a regrettable incident.Lukas Hedges portrays his character with an strength and rawness. He's real, powerful, vulnerable, capable of showing a range we don't see in performers this young, and he's probably the best actor here. In my opinion, his role is not secondary, but an equal to Affleck, and there are times when it's impossible to look away from his body language, his shattering responses which are a combination of pain and anger.Nothing will prepare us for the encounters between Affleck and his ex wife, in particular the one where he runs into her and has to keep himself from crashing when she asks for forgiveness and attempts a sort of connection that only leads to catastrophic results. Williams is able to convey, pain, sorrow, anger, regret, and other dark emotions that have been festering in her and somehow she managed to appear to control.There are many damaged beings in here. What we don't know is whether the ""accident"" is really what triggered all this decay, or maybe it was already there, and it was going to happen. There are hints that happiness was a part of this world, but that many incidents and some bad luck led to the disintegration of the relationships. They might never heal, but there is hope, and it all starts with understanding and with honesty. The last scene is real and touching, and once again it involves Hedges.Not everything works here. The use of classic music in a couple of important scenes is a little too much, a little too much manipulation, and we could have done with a bit of editing of the overuse of beautiful vistas. ""On Golden Pond"" and ""Brokeback Mountain"" did a much better job using those to enhance the moment or the passage of time. The film also had a couple of scenes that could be better in the ""deleted sections"" of a Blu-Ray release. This year, ""Moonlight"" kept you wishing for more, didn't spare the darkness and the rawness of the pain. Here, maybe we are given too much, and it might have just ruined a perfect thing.",Manchester by the Sea,4034228
41,maurice_yacowar,Self-loathing man can't bring himself to adopt nephew,10/10,10 December 2016,"Two water scenes frame the narrative and establish the central character's fall from grace and failure of redemption. The water scenes ‚Äî like the title ‚Äî are significant because they provide the serenity and beauty in counterpoise to the characters' roiling emotions, anger and guilt. Manchester is the troubled human community that abuts the surrounding, supportive sea. In the opening scene Lee, happy and carefree, frolics with his young nephew Patrick on brother Joe's boat. In their play Lee teases Patrick that he, Lee, should be the person Patrick should choose as best able to help them survive on a desert isle ‚Äî not the boy's father. But the bulk of the film demonstrates the increasing gap between the competent Joe and the self destructive Lee. The film gradually reveals how the carefree Lee fell into the violent despair of his later life. Lee is broken when his drunken binge turns into the fire that kills his three children. He retreats into a life of menial chores and drunken, belligerent evenings. On Joe's death, Lee struggles to escape his brother's assignment to be Patrick's guardian and trustee. Yet that first scene establishes the memories and the relationship that would make Patrick want Lee to be his guardian, regardless of his present state.Handyman Lee can fix anything but himself. Although he recovers something of his earlier relationship with Patrick, Lee can't bring himself to accept responsibility for him. ""I can't beat it,"" he says, ""I can't beat it."" The ""it"" is his guilt and self-loathing that linger from his children's' death. Lee can't accept his ex-wife's impassioned forgiveness, precluding any chance of his own peace and self-acceptance as well as hers. His violent outbursts against others hide/reveal his inability to forgive himself. When the police interview him about his children's death, he is as much disappointed as surprised that they will not be punishing him. ""You mean I can go?"" ""It's no crime to forget to put back the fire screen.""In the last shot Lee and Patrick sit on the pier fishing. They are together but apart ‚Äî as they are in every one of their conversations when the language that should connect them separates them instead. Their elliptical conversations are bridges that only widen the gaping gap. At the end the men have a new camaraderie and closeness ‚Äî but it is only partial and late. It rests upon Lee having finalized his detachment from Patrick and arranged for another couple to adopt him. Patrick's cheeky but fond insults contrast to Lee's inability to express sentiments at all. Instead of openly admitting he's rented a flat with an extra room for Patrick to visit, Lee says it's to provide more room for his own stuff. To his ex-wife's desperate apologies Lee can only hide behind a shell of stammering. Young Patrick shows more aplomb in handling the nervous chatter of his mother, when she briefly flirts with the notion of having him come live with her and her new Christian fianc√© (played by Lonergan's standby for flawed righteousness, Matthew Broderick). The water scenes ‚Äî set in summer flashbacks, against Lee's winter present ‚Äî emblematize the grace from which Lee falls and which his failure to forgive himself prevents recovery. A gull at the end of the credits suggests the soaring spirit that Lee has lost. As the most poignant loss is played against a powerful theme from Handel's Messiah, the later Lee's only joyful scene in the present plays against a song that merges romantic and spiritual love, ""I'm Beginning to See the Light."" As usual Lonergan assumes an emblematic cameo himself. In You Can Count on Me (2000) he played the minister who posits the film's central theme: ""Can you believe that your life is important?"" That question hangs over Lee here as it did over James Franco's earlier hero. Here Lonergan plays the passer-by who hears Lee swearing at Patrick. ""Good parenting,"" he snaps, provoking Lee's profane response. As it happens, Lee could be Patrick's effective father- substitute, if only he could reset his life with self-acceptance. This is a very brave film. It takes courage to unfold at such a languorous pace, with such spare and pointed music, with dialogue that leaves so much unspoken and such nuanced performances. This year we've had few scenes as rich as Casey Affleck's performance after Joe's funeral, especially the compound inflections of his glance when he meets his ex-wife's new man. Affleck deserves the Oscar hype. So does Lonergan for daring to tell a story of contemporary guilt and shame where no character finds an easy redemption and the hero a bare gesture towards one. Occasionally fishing with your nephew is a far cry from assuming the responsibility he wants and needs you to.",Manchester by the Sea,4034228
42,artmania90,A spiritual experience that is one of the great movies of the 21st Century,10/10,16 January 2017,"One of my all-time favorite movie scenes is in 1980's ""Ordinary People."" The story follows Conrad, a high school student who is dealing with the sudden death of his brother and living with two parents who have no idea how to cope. Behind a picturesque middle-class facade, things are slowly unraveling. The final moments of the film, after we learn that Conrad's parents have decided to separate, shows him and his father in a quiet and cold backyard. Even though these two have rarely seen eye-to-eye, and in a conclusion where everything seems hopeless, Conrad simply tells his father ""I love you,"" and in response his father breaks down and says the same. I think the reason I love this scene so much is because it offers a movie so full of darkness the slightest suggestion of hope. It suggests that the love of family is still stronger and cannot be overcome.I only mention this scene and ""Ordinary People"" in particular because almost 40 years later here is a movie that is a spiritual equal. ""Manchester By The Sea"" is a massive undertaking that deals with loss in such an intimate way that it would be hard to call it anything but profound. There is something entirely universal everyone can grasp and yet watching this movie feels like a peek into a very real life of a family.Lee Chandler (Casey Affleck) is a man whose life is stagnant. He works as a handyman in a series of apartment buildings, fixing leaking pipes and whatnot. He lives in a basement studio apartment that is sparsely decorated and lifeless. He drinks by himself, and he is rude to those around him. In the first half of this film, Lee is not a character we understand or even like. In fact, he is oftentimes despicable. He gets into bar fights and swears at women. When he takes a phone call to learn of his brother's sudden death, he calmly says he will get there within the hour.Manchester-by-the-Sea (the town's actual name) is where Lee seemingly grew up, raised a family, as evidence by many flashbacks that pepper the film with glimpses into his memory. We recall the moment when his brother, Joe (Kyle Chandler) was first diagnosed with congenital heart disease, or when he took his nephew Patrick on a fishing boat. Now in the present time, Patrick is a high school student with no mother and only Lee as his seeming guardian.The movie becomes an evaluation of the stages of grief and we focus on the relationship between uncle and nephew. Lee, who remains shut off from the community, and Patrick, who invites friends over for pizza and stories on the very day his father died. No one is to say which way is the preferred method for mourning, and of course the emotions begin a series of highs and lows as the two men begin the process of moving on with life. Lee, who is adamant about living in Boston, faces pushback from Patrick who is adamant about finishing high school in Manchester among friends. Here, he has a boat, friends, a band, and two girlfriends (I know). In Boston, all Lee has is a sad apartment. There's no arguing there.What is surprising about the film (where can I start) is the stark humor that comes amidst moments of such melancholy. This is easily a story that could have sunk into our hearts and left us feeling cold, but there is a joy that comes from the way these characters talk to each other and interact. There is an established history that is evidence in the writing. What else is mesmerizing is a score that incorporates classical pieces as opposed to an original soundtrack. There is something so powerful about the contrast between the New England setting and such complex music. Maybe more impressive still is the tight structure of the script, which weaves back and forth through time and gives us such a sense of depth and backstory. Kenneth Lonergan (the director and screenwriter) has surely written the favorite for an Oscar nomination.Casey Affleck, an actor of considerable talent, seems to have finally become his own person outside the shadow of his brother. His performance is quite simply jaw-dropping. Closed in and reclusive and yet with hints of a broken heart, there are glances and gestures that are so nuanced that you can't help but think that this could be the best performance of the year. As with Michelle Williams playing his wife, this could very easily be her best role to date. Her brief screen time in all but 4 or 5 scenes encompasses the themes of the film and reveal the deeper heartbreak just below the surface of their relationship. The same can be said of Lucas Hedges playing Patrick, a young actor full of promise and grace.There were several scenes when I found myself genuinely moved, mouth agape at how honest this movie actually was. When Patrick finally comes to term with his father's loss while looking for a snack... When Lee and his wife exchange a hug at the funeral and a surge of emotion sweeps through both of them... A scene where Lee picks up a gun... These are candid moments that are so real, so perfect, I can't help but think that ""Manchester by the Sea"" is the year's best film.",Manchester by the Sea,4034228
43,kvmarcin,Affleck's acting is excellent but screenplay is half-baked,5/10,18 December 2016,"I've very much enjoyed other Kenneth Lonergan films, and I've admired Casey Affleck's acting gifts for a long time. Because of the rave reviews, I was looking forward to seeing this. Unfortunately, the film went into production with a half-baked script. It probably needed another 5-6 rewrites to make the characterization more layered, develop the subplots more, and get to the pith of the central conflict, which was extremely weak.The story didn't really get off the ground until the last third of the film. It's a testament to Affleck's acting, not the story, that the film managed to sustain my interest. The only thing I'll say about the music is that the classical music was used in a very ham-handed fashion to manipulate the audience's emotion.Affleck plays a character named Lee, who has suffered a tragedy from which he can't recover. He does his best with an taciturn, undeveloped character whose aims are vague and is so caught in depression and grief that he displays little outward emotional expression. The other major character is Patrick, a teenage boy whose father, Affleck's brother, has died suddenly.One of the big wrongs in the screenplay is that we don't get any sense that Patrick is grieving or even in shock about his father's death until a contrived scene later in the movie about a refrigerator that is a weak, unconvincing attempt to show Patrick has feelings about his father.The relationship between Lee and Patrick is meandering and with mild conflict here and there. It's supposed to be the spine of the movie, but it's so flaccid that the film often lacks focus.I think this movie has something to say, but it's not fully articulated, because the film was shot before the script was fully ready for production.",Manchester by the Sea,4034228
44,areinhol,It didn't work for me,5/10,6 January 2017,"Our hero is an angry man who can't seem to hold it together. Through a series of flashbacks we learn why: a great tragedy has traumatized him. But this is not just any tragedy, I can't think of anything worse that could happen to someone. Oedipus Rex plucks out his eyes with less cause. So there is plenty of motivation for him becoming an angry loner, but his past could motivate any dramatic outcome, celibate monk, mass murderer, iconoclastic artist, CIA assassin, raving lunatic. Call a suicide prevention hot line with his backstory and they might direct you to a right-to-die website.Psychotherapy is apparently never an option in the townie macho culture the film depicts; the local police have a very strong reason to get him counseling, but there is no indication they ever do. Self-medication with alcohol is the only succor he gets. OK, so I understand why our hero is angry, but why are most of the other characters attempting a Boston accent so touchy? The accent-free characters in the film never get upset. Despite the portentous music, the film's front story is not so tragic. (A different score could turn this glass-half-empty downer into a half-full feel-good charmer. Some film school should do the experiment.) Our hero realizes his limitations and makes some reasonable choices. The brilliantly acted and Oscar-headed moment when his ex-wife tries to help made me wonder just how she managed to get over it so well.An inability to control his fists is our hero's one shortcoming. Watching a seething Casey Affleck staring out his late brother's bedroom window, my immediate reaction was at least he isn't punching his fist through the glass, and then, a second later, he does. No angry-male stereotypes were harmed in the making of this movie.My takeaway? Check your smoke detectors regularly.",Manchester by the Sea,4034228
45,classicsoncall,"""I can't beat it. I can't beat it.""",7/10,29 December 2016,"My theater crowd sat in stunned disbelief when this was over, stunned that it went absolutely nowhere. There were actually audible gasps here and there. The assortment of Kleenex I brought in anticipation of the warnings posted by other reviewers was never in serious jeopardy of leaving my pocket. And this wasn't just my reaction. I attended the film with three women (I'm a guy), and none of them had a positive response to the picture.I'm guessing the tear jerker moments consisted of two emotional scenes that in another picture might have gotten to me, but here were tempered by other considerations. The first was the flashback of Casey Affleck's character recalling the tragedy that destroyed his family. The other was the intense confrontation between Lee Chandler's (Affleck) ex-wife Randi (Michelle Williams) and Lee himself, in which she pours out her heart over her own grief and love for him. A well played scene but unmoving on the part of Chandler, so the pathos over what might have been didn't have a chance to resonate with this viewer.With all that however, I can't take exception with the Screen Actors Guild nomination for an Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture. All the players did do a good job, it's just that none of their performances went anywhere, nor did the story. One thing that affected my viewing might have been the sound quality of the picture, as the others in my party also had some trouble with the dialog. So I'm not opposed to a second viewing when this eventually comes out on DVD with captioning available. Even so, the accolades for the picture by the critical intelligentsia escapes me. One plus - the cinematography that captures the environs of Manchester by the Sea is stunning. It kind of makes me want to visit.",Manchester by the Sea,4034228
46,ritera1,Profoundly poor,5/10,26 December 2016,"And just a general bummer.Granted, Affleck's performance was very good. And the kid was likable. But there wasn't much of a road traveled. It was just walking back and forth on the same street. Very repetitive. I believe it took 45 minutes to get to when Affleck finds out he's the guardian. Way too long. Just a lot of regular people being regular people in the midst of a tragedy that was likely to happen eventually. I found it very odd how the kid takes the death of his father for granted. Sure, there was one panic attack very late in the movie, but it really didn't seem genuine.And everything was very repetitive. Many different ways on how the kid wants to have sex with his girlfriend. For some reason this is very important to him, even though he's having sex with another girl. Doesn't really make him likable. I really didn't find that it would be difficult to find time to have sex with either of them.Then several instances where Affleck and the kid have back-and-forths that were funny, but were numerous. No real reason why the kid had an attachment to Affleck being that he was absent a vast majority of the time. It was odd that the dead father completely prepared for his death but there was no money left over for an engine for the boat. And it was just a bummer. Affleck failed at the task at hand. He could not move forward. He was an aggressive drunk at the beginning and the same at the end. He did not overcome anything. Life just went on. How cheery!",Manchester by the Sea,4034228
47,michael-kerrigan-526-124974,An acting masterclass,10/10,19 November 2021,"I just watched Manchester by the Sea for the second time. Wow. An emotional rollercoaster of a film. It was even better on second viewing because you could understand the acting nuance in its context from the start. Casey Affleck is unbelievably good. Should be oscar winning performance. Went from 8 from first viewing to 9 on second. It is so thought provoking - especially if you've had painful experience of family dying too young. If you haven't seen it, you must. Keep your tissues close by. It is a masterpiece xx.

48,beglenrice,It's good but why all the..,6/10,19 December 2016,"This is written for people who have already seen the film. Holding the audience captive in suspense as to what is the dark beyond in the main character's life does nothing. It slows down the movie and makes it tedious. When writers contrive these flashback-to-present scenes, it has to have a big payoff, or what's the point? In general, telling this story mostly chronologically would have served the pacing and sense of the film much better. After an hour or so into the film we finally know 'what happened' and finally we can really just watch the movie. The movie is about how a guy recovers from a tragedy by facing the prospect of becoming his nephew's guardian. But you don't get to be in on that until it's almost too late. It's stupid. The relationship between the uncle and nephew does turn out to be quite interesting and worth watching once you get there. Before then it's a conceptual writer's device to jump back and forth in time to somehow make the movie more suspenseful or something. Once the tragedy is revealed the movie becomes much more cohesive and for me, a pleasure to watch. Overall I think it is good, it's just perplexing as to why writers go to such great lengths to invent concepts that don't serve to tell the story well. Being artistic is mistaken for contriving conception. Oh well. It's still pretty good, with solid acting compensating for writer/director ego.",Manchester by the Sea,4034228
49,chaitov,This film another reason to be turned off Hollywood,1/10,5 February 2017,"Besides the rants of so called Hollywood ""stars"" like Madonna,Ashley Judd, Cher,Whoopie Goldberg,Manchester By The Sea has confirmed my belief that Hollywood movies have reached the lowest denominator in years. I expected a great movie considering all the acclaim by reviewers.It is a boring,unimaginative,slow moving,depressing,film that a middle or high school student could do for a class project to show how not to make a movie. Casey Affleck is a terrible actor.Most of the time he stares into space with little dialogue.And suddenly he's smashing someone in the face.There's no depth to this script and no character development either. I kept yawning about to doze off and looking at my watch. The cinematography is good but if I wanted a travelogue about the Boston & surrounding towns in winter,this would be appropriate for that alone. The baroque music just added to the depressing qualities in this film. It never lets up.There are no redeeming features for this film. It should be tossed in the garbage heap never to be heard from again.Please ,don't waste your money & if curious watch it at home on Netflix.",Manchester by the Sea,4034228
50,ElMaruecan82,"A haunting and emotional tale of guilt, family ties and redemption...",10/10,19 February 2017,"Whenever I see someone being uncommunicative, acting unfriendly or being plain rude, my immediate reflex is to give this person a respectful benefit of the doubt. This presumption of inner goodness is essential because¬Ö seriously, how many people we know in our lives have gotten such a bad break from life that they can't manage not even to fake happiness? A lot and we know it, life can be tough in the blindest and meanest ways, so no one can be offensive and happy. As a matter of fact, no one can hate people and love himself; unhappiness is deeply rooted in guilt and low self-esteem. This is the core of ""Manchester by the Sea"", Kenneth Lonergan's powerful family drama starring Casey Affleck, Michelle Williams, Lucas Hedges and Kyle Chandler. Lonergan wrote and directed the film and it's simply one of the rawest and most authentic portrayal of the way family ties can be profoundly affected by tragedies, and the way relationships, mostly those where love is taken for granted, are undermined by the very lack of love directed to yourself. But I'm making the film sound too complicated while it's about a rather simple but harrowing journey. Lee Chandler (Affleck) learns about the death of his brother Joe (Chandler), he informs his nephew Patrick (Hedges) and learns that, according to his brother's will, he'll be his guardian until his eighteenth birthday.When this happens, the movie has already been on for one hour, and so far, what we discovered from Lee is that he's a reclusive and secretive janitor and handyman and whom likability isn't the strongest suit. Patrick on the other hand is a teenager who doesn't strike as a very troubled one, pleasantly far from the usual archetypes, he's articulate, sarcastic but rarely in a hurtful way, he's in good mental and physical shape: he's in the hockey and basket teams, he's in a band and he can also afford the luxury of two girlfriends. The reason why he keeps himself so busy becomes clearer as we get more insights about his childhood, raised by a positive father figure who divorced from his alcoholic wife. But Patrick never resented his mother and kept in touch with her.One of the merits of ""Manchester by the Sea"" is that it never really tackles its subject with the usual material, we do have death, alcoholism, loneliness and bar fights, but the characters make it look fresh and unusual in a realistic way. For all the demons that inhabit them, they also act like normal, ordinary family members, skipping some subjects, commenting on trivial stuff, many things are left unspoken but with such a rich subtext we never need to know more. This is a triumph of screen writing and I'm looking forward to seeing Loneegan win the Oscar for Original Screenplay. And it's also a great piece of storytelling, because a linear narrative would have made things clear from the beginning, but for such a tremendous loss in emotional impact.Indeed, we've got to follow Lee for one long and painful hour, ignoring a woman who's obviously trying to make out with him or punching one guy because he didn't like 'his look' but then after one hour, and a few flashbacks, we finally get his ""problem"" and we understand why he's acting this way, he earns our immediate empathy, it's not just an 'attitude'. Never underestimate the many moments of quietness the film offers, they might the silence before storm of devastatingly poignant resonances. And without relying too much on the good old ""you'll laugh! You'll cry"" tag-line trope, but this is also a screenplay that injects a good deal of comedy sometimes, in order to remind us that even in the most dramatic situations, there's room for a little smile.""Manchester by the Sea"" belongs to that so unfairly overlooked family drama genre that produced masterpieces like ""Terms of Endearment"" or ""Ordinary People"". There are actually ordinary people in this film with their flaws, their lack of obviousness, so to speak, and on that level, while everyone deserves the praises and I'm glad that both Hedges and Williams were Oscar nominated but Casey Affleck gives one of the most authentic performances ever. It's simple, you never feel like he's playing, many times, he's like hesitating, neither happy, nor sad and I wondered why he picked that angle in his performance. Well, because Lee doesn't know, he's figuring out what to say. An actor who's learned his screenplay knows exactly what line he's going to say, but Affleck has this incredible ability to make a situation feel as awkward as embarrassing as if it was real. And the authenticity he pulls in his performance is so great, you don't feel like watching a film but eavesdropping.I hope to see this film win at least two Oscars, and one of them is for Affleck. But even without any awards, this is a powerful story that will resonate in the hearts of many people who had their tough deal in life. There's no message, no point except that one ""can't just die"", no matter the problems that poisoned your life, if you're alive enough to think about them, you better get busy doing something else and loving yourself a little, because otherwise, you're screwed. Both Patrick and Lee get busy living but their experience allow them to learn one thing or two about life, and so do we. And by closing the film with a shot similar to the first, less optimistic but with a bittersweet quality on its own, Lonergan tells us that there's always a gateway from social exclusion and a time to get rid of our demons and come full circle.And in this melancholy time where it's ""finito"" for IMDb message boards, I dedicate this review to their memory and the great time I spend there. It's been a privilege and it's been fun.",Manchester by the Sea,4034228

52,W011y4m5,Capturing humanity with an observant gaze,8/10,24 March 2019,"Manchester By The Sea is a lovely little indie feature which aims to intimately capture the essence of everyday lives of normal, working-class people across the country - their mundanity, flaws & tragic beauty - taking the time to simply observe one particular family & the impact a relative's unexpected death has on those around them, it deals strongly with repeated occuring themes of grief & how multiple individuals choose to deal with it. Its brutally honest & simplistic depiction of events also grounds the film in a reality which feels reassuringly familiar to those watching & the beautifully understated, subtle performances gift the characters with a poignancy & undeniable relatability - meaning however slow or monotonous their days progress, you can't help but be emotionally invested in their engaging stories, regardless.
Casey Affleck is incredible & must also be acknowledged especially for the stunning job he did with this movie too. His acting was absolutely outstanding.

This is an excellent film and in many ways a fascinating character study of someone going through a life tragedy. It's raw, realistic and powerful, and benefits from some outstanding acting performances.Casey Affleck is an actor I hadn't seen too much from before this film, but his performance in 'Manchester by the Sea' was masterful. He got his character in this film spot on. I also think that Lucas Hedges deserves a mention for such a mature and realistic performance as Patrick. He sure has a bright future ahead of him if this film is anything to go by.'Manchester by the Sea' is one of the best films of 2016. It's a depressing picture with some dark themes, but is truly engrossing and beautifully shot. 'La La Land' and 'Moonlight' were both great, but if I had to pick a film to recommend from 2016, it would probably be this one or the overlooked 'Captain Fantastic'.",Manchester by the Sea,4034228

55,RforFilm,Manchester by the Sea is a realistic movie about realistic people that you'd find in the Boston area,8/10,5 January 2017,"What's odd about 2016 is that we've gotten a bunch of films about grief. Summertime gave us Captain Fantastic and December was Collateral Beauty. The good news (which is ironic given it's subject matter) is that there is always an audience for them as people die all the time. Death can be a tough subject that changes lives, especially to the living of those close to them. So why are a lot of people unprepared when the ticking moment finally happens? Probably because we don't like to think about it and what troubles it could bring us. Most of us would rather enjoy the happy moments if there are any. Though the idea is scary, I have sat down with my parents to find out whose going to take care of whom. Whose going to deal with the financial stuff and what about the house? These were legitimate concerns that I wanted to get a better understanding of. Sometimes, people are given responsibilities that their not even ready to get. This might include a house they can't get to or a collection they can't sell. Maybe even possibly custody of a child. The latter is explored in Manchester by the Sea. Lee Chandler (played by Casey Affleck) is a janitor working in Quincy, Massachusetts who is introverted and is quick to action when confronted. He gets a call one morning about his brother Joseph (played by Kyle Chandler) being in an accident. After driving up north to see what the deal is, Lee finds out that Joseph has died from a heart attack. He then heads to the town of Manchester-by-the-Sea to tell Joseph's son Patrick about his fathers passing. We're shown initially that Lee used to be close to his nephew, but after a tragedy happened, they've haven't spoken in a while. Going into town, Lee sees that Patrick (played by Lucas Hedges) is now sixteen and happens to be a popular student. He tells his nephew of his fathers passing and vows to stay with him until the funeral. This seems to be a set back as Lee discovers that Joseph had set up his will for Lee to be Patrick's guardian. Lee doesn't feel like he's up for the responsibility, as he is still keen on returning to his old life. Patrick isn't too wild about the arraignment either as he would rather stay with his mother, who Lee has shunned. Lee also faces his ex-wife Randi (played by Michelle Williams) who may still have feelings for him.Manchester by the Sea is definitely not a fun movie to sit through. It is, however, a really good drama to witness. For a story about an adult having to look after a child, you'd think that I would go into a route where a lot of stereotypical stories like this go. The good news is that the stories handles itself very maturely, and seems to Segway like something that would happen in real life. I could see something like this going they way it's going, especially in the northeast. If there's something that this movie proves is that the Affleck family is really talented. Casey Affleck is the perfect actor for this kind of role. He looks like a person whose been carrying a lot of weight on his shoulders for a long time. Though their not in the movie that often, Kyle Chandler and Michelle Williams leave some heavy footprints with their performances. Though Manchester by the Sea is set in the gloomy winter, it's still photographed beautifully, giving a lot of the emotion both scope and claustrophobia. I'll give this eight boat motors out of ten. Manchester by the Sea happens to be real story about real people. I'd say that if your looking for something more fun, your not going to find it here. But it is engaging and deserves to be one of the best of 2016.",Manchester by the Sea,4034228

57,jadepietro,All in the Family,9/10,12 December 2016,"(RATING: ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ¬Ω out of 5)  THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.   IN BRIEF: Superb acting and an honest insightful screenplay make this  family drama all the more memorable.   GRADE: B+   SYNOPSIS: A family tragedy impacts a solitary man who must now suddenly  rearrange his life and priorities.  JIM'S REVIEW: Everyone and everything has been estranged from Lee  Chandler. Divorced, content to do menial work, devoid of close family  ties and dear friends, Lee is a solitary figure ill-prepared for life.  A sudden family tragedy leads him back to his nephew, Patrick, a  confused and angry teenager. Forced into the father role, a role he  personally disdains, Lee must come to terms with his family obligations  in Kenneth Lonergan's powerful drama, Manchester by the Sea.  Written and directed by Mr. Lonergan, the film is an insightful  character study, not only of one man and the challenges he faces on a  daily basis, but of the entire Massachusetts community that he calls  home. We meet his fragmented family, including his brother (in  flashbacks), his ex- wife, and other colorful townies. Not much is said  directly, yet much is inferred as they all allude to Lee's deep dark  secret at various times and we slowly begin to piece together Lee's  broken life and intangible dreams.  The ensemble cast is wonderful. Casey Affleck is mesmerizing as the  desolate Lee. His is an introspective restrained performance. He shows  a man filled with hopelessness and pain, quiet in his words, even if  his actions seem violent and uncontrolled at times. Watching the actor  react with subtle glances away from loved ones or downcast stares to  hide his sorrow is so heartfelt and real. Abandoned by his  dysfunctional parents, Lucas Hedges also brings a nuanced and sincere  portrayal of a teenager left to fend for himself. Giving more than  ample support are Kyle Chandler, Gretchen Mol, and particularly  Michelle Williams as Lee's ex-wife. While her part does not share  enough screen time, her scene confronting Lee is raw and moving and  sure to earn her some award recognition.  The film has nary a false note, its dialog capturing the real life feel  of a middle class town and its vivid characters struggling over hard  times. The film is all drama without a shred of melodrama or artificial  theatrics. There are some minor directorial missteps however:. Some  intrusive classical music never quite gels with its surroundings and  that mournfulness is far too manipulative and overt, Also, in a small  role, Matthew Broderick suddenly appears. His recognizable screen  persona seems too jarringly out-of-place with the gritty realism of the  film.   That said, Manchester by the Sea is a bittersweet story (with an  emphasis on the first syllable). It is bleak, sad, and melancholy,  perhaps the feel-bad movie of the year. Yet it shows irony, humor, and  love so candidly. Mr. Lonergan's film depicts our flaws, our awkward  moments, our inability to communicate and simply express our emotions.  But, more importantly, his film shows truths that are generally ignored  in today's cinema.   Manchester by the Sea is one of the best film to convey the meaning of  family and all of its complexities in a totally honest and refreshing  way. It is one of the year's best.",Manchester by the Sea,4034228
58,framptonhollis,cinematic perfection,10/10,13 January 2017,"Few films of the 21st century (so far) can even come close to the breathtaking power of ""Manchester by the Sea"". It's a film that depicts grief and one's inner demons in a painfully powerful way, showcasing the greatest acting of the year. Michelle Williams is especially dazzling, despite her brief role. It's a film that made me tear up at multiple point, a film with a heartbreaking power that only the strongest films can have. It's a tragedy. It's a really, really intense and depressing and emotional tragedy. However, it is never boring because of the masterful direction, acting, and script. The film uses both extreme emotions and subtlety. The classic ""show, don't tell"" rule for cinema had been taught time and time again in every film school across the globe, and this film utilizes that tool brilliantly. The film is never overly simple, and it is not afraid to challenge the viewer. A film like this is unpredictable, therefore making it more suspenseful and, indeed, watchable. The characters are all fully developed and you grow to love and care for them. Information is revealed without it being rubbed in your face in pathetic, poorly written dialogue. Instead, much of it is conveyed through images or implying conversations. The cinematography is beautiful. The bleak, winter scenery is used to full advantage and adds to the films beautiful realism. There is not a fake second in this film, it knows how people really talk and act. The conflicts are always believable and engaging, no matter how depressing they may be, and much of the simple dialogue is fantastic due to it being filled with emotion and (believe it or not) a lot of humor! I must admit, despite this film being a tragic, emotional journey through grief and death, it is quite funny, even hilarious, at times. The humor helps us get through some of the more tough scenes, despite the film never holding back.This is a risky masterpiece. It's beautiful, realistic, human, funny, emotional, and profoundly moving.",Manchester by the Sea,4034228
59,bkoganbing,Chandler Family Values,8/10,23 April 2017,"A whole lot of pretty New England seacoast scenery is lovingly and exquisitely photographed in Manchester By The Sea including the title town. You might even get inspired to take a vacation there after seeing Manchester By The Sea. But there's far more to this film than beautiful scenery.It's the story of the Chandler family uncle and nephew. Lee Chandler lives and works in Boston quite humbly as a janitor when he received the word that his brother Joe just keeled over and died. The family knew this brother had a weak heart and that this could happen. All but one member of the family. The exception being Lucas Hedges his teen son. He's a jock kid, a hockey player with a bit of attitude. But he's quite vulnerable and the father who was played by an actor named Kyle Chandler provided in his will that his brother Lee played by Casey Affleck be the guardian of his kid. The mother who is Gretchen Mol has been separated for years from the father and she's an alcoholic. Another brother has moved to Minnesota.The problem is Affleck left Manchester By The Sea after a mind numbing tragedy of his own that may have been the result of his own carelessness. Casey was and is quite the party animal which was part of what caused the tragedy. In any event he wants nothing to do with Manchester whatsoever.Putting it simply Affleck just never quite got around to growing up. And Hedges is in some critical years and in need of a father, the last thing Affleck wants to be.Writer/Director Kenneth Lonergan took his time and drew some deep and rich characters for his Oscar winning original screenplay. You really think this is a real family struggling with some serious family issues, no actors involved here. Almost like what reality TV should be.The other Oscar that Manchester By The Sea won was for Best Actor for Casey Affleck. Director Lonergan got a great performance that struck all the right notes, where Affleck has to be contained he is, where he explodes with emotion it's the right amount. Credit has to go for his instincts as well.Lucas Hedges was nominated for Best Supporting Actor and I'm sure we'll see a lot from him as well. See the travails of the Chandler family as real as cinema gets.",Manchester by the Sea,4034228
60,tigerfish50,Love and Loss in Lobsterland,1/10,12 December 2016,"'Manchester by the Sea' is set in a similar demographic to Lonergan's earlier film 'You Can Count On Me', which depicted a couple of New England siblings struggling to deal with emotional turmoil caused by some of life's everyday problems. Manchester's plot is relatively simple - a reclusive, short-tempered handyman called Lee is entrusted with the unwanted guardianship of a teenage nephew after his brother's sudden death, and this upheaval complicates his dismal existence.Michelle Williams and the support cast do a decent job creating the Massachusetts coastal community surrounding Lee, but Casey Affleck's one-note performance is too stubbornly dour to sustain interest in his lead character over a two-hour film. The camera trudges after Lee throughout the proceedings, revealing a monosyllabic, hard-drinking sourpuss. Eventually, through flashbacks, it shows how various intoxicants combined with a minor oversight cost him his sense of humor and much else besides. By the time this revelation has arrived, it's become hard to care overmuch for the surly protagonist, his sorry tale or how he resolves his current dilemma. Manchester would have probably been a more memorable story if Lonergan's script had chosen to follow the path of Michelle Williams' sharp-tongued Randi.",Manchester by the Sea,4034228
61,masonmorgan-92917,A beautiful story of love and hope when we needed one the most,8/10,4 January 2017,"Kenneth Lonergan's Manchester by the Sea has been one of the year's most acclaimed films and all that Oscar buzz is certainly justified. Manchester by the Sea unapologetically explores themes of grief, family, teenage youth and just general daily inconveniences. Along with phenomenal performances from the main cast, Manchester's incredibly intimate and personal story will resonate deeply, and differently, with every viewer, not only making this one of the year's best films, but one of the year's most human films.Casey Affleck has only yet been nominated for the Best Actor Oscar, but it truly wouldn't be too naive to say that he has already won. His performance may be seen as lacking of any emotion, but within the context of the film, his emotional subtlety and understatement makes him just as real as anyone in the audience. While it is easy to dismiss him as emotionless, the grief that his character has been subjected to more than excuses his lack of social skills and general introvert nature. The rest of the cast is simply fantastic as well. Michelle Williams is perfectly damaged and Lucas Hedges is believably juvenile, making the entire cast of characters feel like real people, which is just about the best compliment an actor can receiver for his/her work. The story is very well told, despite some admittedly borrowed ideas. No matter who you are, there is guaranteed to be something within Manchester by the Sea that you can relate to on a personal level. Whether that be hitting your head on the freezer door, forgetting where you park your car or awkward family dinners, the screenplay features many little details that all work in part to make Manchester a completely immersive and human story. There is always a sense of heart within the film as even the darkest and most emotional moments are all handled sensibly leading to some beautiful sorrow and hilariously dark humor. The tone is quite inconsistent but it never becomes too distracting as new layers of meaning and emotion are revealed throughout. There are scenes of gut- wrenching tragedy and ironic comedy within seconds of each other, making for some choked-up chuckles, but nonetheless a memorable experience.Sometimes hilariously insensitive, sometimes emotionally devastating and always engaging, Manchester by the Sea tells a story that anyone can relate to at some point during it's run-time. It's at its strongest when it serves as a window into a life not too far from the viewer's. It may not be life-changing or endlessly re-watchable, but Manchester by the Sea is guaranteed to evoke emotion from any viewer, whether it be through laughter, tears or the painfully accurate and relatable actions of the characters. Most importantly, it serves as a beautifully human beacon for a year that was at times seriously lacking sympathy and love, making Manchester by the Sea feel like a warm hug when comfort was most needed.",Manchester by the Sea,4034228
62,Screen_Blitz,A spellbinding emotional roller-coaster with a tremendous performance by Casey Affleck,9/10,26 February 2017,"Nearly everyone faces an unspeakable tragedy at least once in their lives, and many film have deeply reflected on this emotional phenomenon. Unfortunately nowadays, many of these films tend to fall victim to manipulating audience's emotions with hokey sentimentality and melodrama. Luckily, this film directed by Kenneth Lonergan is not one of those films. Centering on a story of man shattered with grief and tragedy, this film places Casey Affleck in the driver's seat of this powerful emotional roller-coaster and transpires to a riveting tale of a man facing his past and learning overcome a tragedy that puts a gash of the man he once was. Shedding away the use of emotional manipulation and a sappy music score, Kenneth Lonergan draws a path to a heart-wrenching story that rarely feels cinematic but very real in nature. By the end credits, it should come to no surprise if you find yourself using a tissue or two. This film stars Casey Affleck as Lee Chandler, a sulky loner who works as a handyman in Boston isolated from his family and friends. One day, when his older brother Joe (played by Kyle Chandler) dies of a heart attack, he returns to his hometown of Manchester to look after his 16-year old nephew Patrick (played by Lucas Hodges). Upon his return, he is shocked to discover Joe has placed him as Patrick's legal guardian. Haunted by his tragic past, Lee begins wrestling with the decision to either take Patrick with him to Boston, or stay in his hometown -- a place he never wanted to return to.Kenneth Lonergan takes his film in a direction not intended to blackmail viewers in shedding tears but to tell an honest tale about how tragedy can tear not only one person, but an entire family apart. By all means, his effort lands with near-perfection. From the opening minutes of the film, we are introduced to Casey Affleck's Lee Chandler who's definitely not a easy guy to like, he has a sore attitude and at one point, gets in a petty fistfight at a bar. But as the story unfolds, the film proceeds in-and-out through a long series of solidly edited flashbacks that retread unpleasant events from his past that lead to the downfall of his relationships with his family and friend and eventually prompted him to leave the hometown he once new. By his point, your apathy for this character evolves into sympathy as he reveals to be not a bad guy but a man strangled with a brooding past. Before the halfway marks, it becomes clear that the lead character is not the only who's completely broken, his whole family including his nephew Patrick and ex-wife (played by Michelle Williams) are shattered as well. And the story leaves only a small room for occasional humor and levity. There's one scene with Affleck and Michelle Williams late in the film that's tough to sit through and a flashback scene with him and Kyle Chandler early on that pulls at your heart strings. And there is rarely a moment that feels a hokey tearjerker ripped from another cinematic entity.Casey Affleck takes the daunting task of carrying the film on his shoulders, and with a performance so tremendous and powerful; he greatly succeeds. This actor proves capable of carrying on sufficient emotional gravitas and honest sentimentality. Every minute he comes on screen, this talent shines like gold. If this isn't the best role of his career, I don't know what is. Supporting him by his side is Lucas Hodges playing his troubled teenage nephew who struggles trying to maintain a gripping relationship with his uncle who's plunged into sorrow to open with his nephew (or anyone for that matter). His performance stands strong especially for an actor in his late teens. Kyle Chandler, who's appearance is limited to various flashbacks is also quite powerful and worth admiring. Michelle Williams plays Casey Affleck's ex-wife and does not get a great amount of screen time beyond seven minutes or so, does a great job especially in an aforementioned scene with Affleck towards the end. Gretchen Mol does a fine job as Patrick's mother as does Matthew Broderick as her soon-to-be husband, but like Michelle Williams, not a lot of screen time. While the film shines with a diverse cast of powerful performances, it is Casey Affleck who becomes the pedaling force of the film's riveting atmosphere.Manchester By The Sea is a powerful, heartrending film bound with riveting performances by an awe-inspiring cast and a thoughtful direction by Kenneth Lonergan. It is a movie destined not to sweep you away with emotional devastation but a thought-provoking story about family, love, and sorrow that feels thoroughly honest. In a triumphant achievement, it stands tall as one of the most powerful films of 2016.",Manchester by the Sea,4034228
63,george.schmidt,Affleck is Oscar bound in one of the year's very best films. A must see.,10/10,28 November 2016,"MANCHESTER BY THE SEA (2016) **** Casey Affleck, Lucas Hedges, Kyle Chandler, Michelle Williams, CJ Wilson, Gretchen Mol, Matthew Broderick, Tate Donovan, Josh Hamilton, Kara Hayward, Anna Baryshnikov, Heather Burns. Affleck gives an Oscar worthy performance in a career defining performance as a New Englander handyman, Lee Chandler, who prefers to keep others at arms' length in an everlasting downward spiral wrestling with personal demons that comes to a head when his beloved brother Joe (Chandler) suddenly dies leaving him as guardian in trust to his nephew Patrick (aspiring newcomer Hedges who gives good thrust and parry with Affleck in dynamite chemistry) who also is dealing with his teenage hood and growing pains. Filmmaker Kenneth Lonergan (who has a funny cameo as an insulting bypasser) truly gets at the heart of what it means to grieve in piercing, poignant aplomb while letting his actors get at their inner core of feeling. Gorgeously shot with picturesque cinematography by Jody Lee Lipes suggesting Norman Rockwell's America and an unlikely source for one's personal hellish homecoming. Remarkable in its relative low-key balance and appreciative peppering of much welcome humor to an otherwise glum storyline. Affleck is truly remarkable and his reunion with Williams is one for the film vaults; one of the year's very best films and a must see.",Manchester by the Sea,4034228
64,rjk541,Critics Completely Missed on This One,3/10,11 January 2017,"""Manchester-By-The-Sea""...don't bother...wait for twenty years until it comes out on an old time movie channel at around 2 am and you need something to put you to sleep. The script is bad. The direction is bad. The make-up is bad. The sets are bad. The costumes are fine, because they are everyday clothes of working class people in the Northeast (Boston and other areas). I found Casey Affleck's performance to be the only redeeming quality in this overrated piece of digital media. He (Affleck) portrays a brooding, jack-ass, violent, bully of an alcoholic very accurately...almost as if he were one or was a another victim of the Hollywood hamburger machine(I applaud him..not standing ""O,"" but polite applause because everything else in the movie was BORING). About that corpse (yes, there's a corpse in one scene): Not a corpse. Not a dead human look-a-like...but a live person trying to pull it off. It doesn't work. How was this evident? The cheeks and face were still naturally pink and flesh tone. There was a popping vein near the temple area. Really? Did you studio execs really think no one who would see this ""movie"" would have seen a real corpse? Come on. If you have seen dysfunctional, violent alcoholics who attack people in bars who they think are staring at them, or are smaller than the drunk, and families who have a hard time handling ""life,"" in real life, you have seen this movie. Three stars because of Affleck's performance. Zero for the movie as a whole.",Manchester by the Sea,4034228
65,martimusross,Very Upsetting....I loved it!,8/10,20 November 2018,"This movie is a tour de force of emotion dragging you relentlessly through the stages grief, namely shock, bewilderment, anger, pain and reconciliation.Mr Affleck using his brooding method style to reveal a complex and brooding character that develops and evolves as the movie progresses.There are two clear examples of both masterful acting and directing that I will cite, he turns to drink after a bad experience and goes to saloon, but he tries to avoid intimacy as he can't cope with emotion due to guilt and grief and then the only expression left to him is to fight. All sounds so simple but to convey this and present the psychological depth of dysfunction is both deeply moving and uncomfortable to watch.The other is where Mr Affleck blames himself for the death of his children, he sits bewildered waiting to be condemned for his heinous crime, he waits for the lash, when the police state it's an accident and he can go home he tries to take a gun and blow his brains out. The power of this desperate act was raw and visceral and deeply effecting.I can see this slow and contemplative movie is not very entertaining for some but as an examination of the human condition it is masterful.",Manchester by the Sea,4034228

There is just something about this movie that spoke to me. The way it is told and the realness of what happens. It is the type of movie that stays with you long after you have watch it... And for me, that is what makes this movie great.",Manchester by the Sea,4034228
67,Danielpotato,Nothing new under the sun,6/10,21 February 2017,"This movie started like any other drama, the main character has a problem, where the story of the film has a beginning, the main character and history suffer a turn and in the end of the second act, and them is the end of the story (third act of the movie itself). In other words, like any other drama, this film follows the already very used old paradigm of Syd Field for scripts. A story told a thousand times before, the same way a thousand times, only the characters change and nothing else. The same situations, the same problems.However I must say that the director of the movie at least had the idea of the main character does not learn anything (moral lesson) at the end of the third act. This earned points to the movie for me, at least.The characters are interesting in most of the part of this film, but only three of them take advantage of the good actors that are in the movie , the characters of Casey Affleck, Lucas Hedges and Michelle Williams. The remaining characters are irrelevant in movie story and they basically do nothing interesting (basically they are filler for this movie).Casey Affleck is good enough but only shows potential in only one scene with Michelle Williams. There are other scenes that his character underutilized, like the scene in the police, in which Lee tries to commit suicide, this scene fails, because the construction of the character itself until then, there was no indication that this character wanted to kill itself, there is not enough tension until that moment. Michelle Williams is also underutilized in most part of the film (she is annoying, to speak the truth, but she also appears little time on the screen), except that scene with the character of Casey Affleck (In the third act of the story, Randi appears with a baby of its new husband). In which both have a talk about their past and about their separation. In this scene there is a lot of tension, and the drama of the actors is well applied. It's an emotionally amazing and perfectly executed scene.Lucas Hedges is good enough, not amazing, but good enough for me to sympathize with him, the freezer scene is pretty good, nonetheless. It's a perfectly executed scene to watch and be admired.But this is the problem of the film for me, taking some scenes (pretty good by the way) where the actors can show their potential, the film is the same thing seen a thousand times before, with the same situations and problems. Nothing new under the sun. If you do not see this movie, you will not miss anything new that you have already seen. It is a good movie, but no classic or masterpiece level of quality.",Manchester by the Sea,4034228
68,lee_eisenberg,family troubles on the New England coast,10/10,15 February 2017,"Family troubles are a common theme in cinema. Kenneth Lonergan's ""Manchester by the Sea"" takes a particularly gritty look. Casey Affleck plays Lee, a volatile handyman. Summoned back to his hometown after his brother suffers a heart attack, he and the rest of the family are forced to confront bad things that happened years earlier.I would say that what makes this movie stand out is the characters. None of them are what one would call ""good"" people. In addition to the irresponsible, short-tempered main character, almost every one of his relatives has hostile side. Seeing what they've been through, it's understandable that they'd be like this. The point is that the bad things that happened in previous years are going to have to force everyone to go through some sort of change.The cast members all put in fine performances. I actually thought that the most interesting role was that of Elise, played by Gretchen Mol. This is the meatiest role that I've seen her play so far (a big difference from her underdeveloped roles in ""Rounders"" and ""The Thirteenth Floor""). But that doesn't subtract from the rest of the characters. It's an outstanding movie in every way. I hope that it receives at least one Academy Award.",Manchester by the Sea,4034228
69,Horst_In_Translation,The younger Affleck's big moment in the spotlight,6/10,10 February 2017,"""Manchester by the Sea"" is an American movie from 2016 and one of the big players this awards season with 4 SAG nominations, 6 BAFTA nominations, 5 Golden Globe nominations (including one win) and 6 Oscar nominations including Best Picture. The movie is really long, almost 2 hours and 20 minutes, and it was written and directed by Kenneth Lonergan, a two-time Oscar nominee before this movie already (one of these for Scorsese's Gangs of New York). Lonergan has been a more prolific writer than director during his long career, but as for his newest movie here, he was the man in charge for both positions. The title references the city of Manchester and as the addition in the title says, this is not the one in England, but the lesser known in New Hampshire. This is the place where the title character Lee, played by Casey Affleck, returns to after his brother dies. Affleck has been the front runner for a long time this season and until the SAG Award win by Denzel Washington, he also seemed a lock for Best Actor glory. Now the race is pretty much open between these two again. Affleck still certainly has a shot at glory unlike Michelle Williams and Lucas Hedges. Supporting actress is probably decided in favor of Oscar beggar Viola Davis and Hedges' nomination was actually a bit surprising that he took the spot as his traction seemed to have died down a little bit. But this support for Hedges may also tell us that the Academy likes the movie, which increases Affleck's chances. I personally am not too sure about the nominations for Hedges and Williams. Both were decent, but among the best of the year I don't know. Their nominations may be referred to as coat-tail. Anyway, the performances of these two could hardly be any more different. Williams only has three scenes basically in the entire movie, but these are among the most memorable because of how loud and in the face they are and because of the crucial things that happen. Hedges on the other hand has a great deal of screen time here, but he really only has one moment that is certified Oscar bait (his breakdown).Anyway, looking at the film as a whole, Williams' character is the protagonist's connection to the past due to a terrible accident that happened back then, while Hedges may be his connection to the future. One thing I found very interesting in connection to Hedges was the use of ice. He plays hockey of course, but one of his most memorable moments is when it comes to him being confronted with a freezer after he has the image of his dad lying in there at the morgue as well and he is really uncomfortable with this thought. Then, after the funeral, his relationship with ice is back to normal as he asks his uncle for some money to buy himself some ice cream. Sure it is a very small (maybe even random) reference, but somehow I found it memorable and mentionable. Now about Affleck, I think he is obviously the heart and soul of the movie and looking at how generally I would not say I am a huge fan of him, he definitely managed a good performance that won me slightly over, at least for this movie. Still, I feel that to me he always comes off as a bit lackluster, but by now I have understood that this is just his style and somehow it fits very nicely with Lee here, so I would say that him being memorable in this film does not necessarily have to do with Affleck giving a great performance. I think it is rather that he was a great casting decision and also that Lonergan's screenplay works wonders and definitely elevates his performance. But I am okay with Affleck's Oscar nomination, a win would be too much though.I already mentioned earlier that this is a pretty long movie. It is certainly not for everybody as there is honestly very little happening and it is all about the characters' relationships and interactions, most of all uncle and nephew growing closer together. It starts relatively early from Hedges' character's side as he sees him almost instantly as some sort of father figure, but Lee does not see him as a son. Actually he does not throughout the entire film. One example would be the conversation about a girl staying overnight early on, which is another great piece of writing. Not that Affleck is bad with his delivery, but it's all Lonergan to me here. There is occasionally a tad of comedy too like the scene with the boy and his two girls, maybe to keep it from becoming too depressing at times I guess. This is never a comedy though and the drama is always the most important component. The film uses flashbacks on several occasions. I generally am not the biggest fan of flashbacks, but here it was working nicely because it was easy to see when these were because Chandler's character was in all of these. I personally think this was a good watch. It's nowhere near the best of the year for me personally (unlike for the Academy), but it is a decent character study and probably among the 15 best written films from 2016. That's why I give it a thumbs-up overall and recommend checking it out.",Manchester by the Sea,4034228
70,zkonedog,I Just Don't See The Appeal Of This Drama-less Film,2/10,25 February 2017,"I saw Manchester By The Sea because it was winning so many awards and garnering so much buzz. Unfortunately, to be completely honest, I just didn't see the appeal of why the film has gotten so much love.To be succinct, the movie was just a bit too dour and flat for my tastes. I know that there is a school of filmmaking which depicts reality in stark fashion, but I think a film needs to have at least some drama, otherwise what is the point at all? I didn't find any drama in the experience at all, as the moments were it could have been present are so underplayed.I saw the potential in Manchester By The Sea, but I feel that it was just played too close to the vest. With the exception of Michelle Williams (whom I saw actual emotion from), everything else was just too bland for me.

71,Morejambo54,"Painful, melancholic and despairing.",7/10,14 March 2021,"From a technical stand point, this movie is incredible. The action is spot on, Casey Affleck proves that he was deserving of best actor from the future parts of the story where is has had such great losses that he no longer feels emotion as he used to, to the past sections where his emotions entangle him and emphasise his suffering. The story is very strong and extremely saddening. The setting is just as dull as the characters and the plot, the music is horrendously depressing and works far too well with the movie.The movie however was a bit repetitive, with the same fight between characters happening over and over and people driving back and fourth. The movie was also really long, or it felt that way, I often found myself asking for the end of the movie and when it came I was kind of relieved that I didn't have to be sad anymore. The movie overall is extremely real and one of the most gut-punching things I have ever seen, real or film. 7?10 shorten it a bit?

He wants to leave Manchester and go back to Boston, mostly because of the tragic event that happened in Manchester some time ago. Patrick wants to stay in Manchester and ""Houston, we have a problem."" We see 2-sides of Lee, one before the tragic event (via flashbacks) and later after the tragic event. We have no idea what happened as we will learn about that way, way later into the story. While he wrestles with his past, he must find a way to accommodate Patrick so he can get back to his life away from Manchester. He does have moments of pure anger when he will start a fight when someone looks at him funny-like and there is one incident when he tries to commit suicide. So he is really not as stable as he seems to be and this causes us to be wary of him.This is slow going and is more like a ""made for TV movie."" They want to give the Best Actor Oscar to Casey Affleck, but I wouldn't go that far. He does okay, but I think flashbacks were needed to show his guilt over that tragic event. There were none. Maybe his violent outbursts shows that guilt. Who knows? When we learn about that tragic event, we see Lee keep everything inside him We do see flashbacks of nicer times with family and with a young Patrick (Ben O'Brien), and wife Randi (Michelle Williams) and Lee's father, Joe (Kyle Chandler). The acting all around is very good. Later, when we see Lee's wife, Randi who remarried and with new child, I got the feeling that she was going to tell Lee that it was she who caused the tragic event, but that didn't happen, but we do see that she is still in love with Lee. Her screen time throughout was short but powerful. Notables: C.J. Wilson as George, a family friend; Matthew Broderick as Jeffery, stepfather to Patrick; and Tate Donovan as the Hockey coach. As mentioned, this is slow going, a kind of slice of life where the players just act out life normally. A little too much language in the beginning, then it goes away.

74,valadas,A devastated man,8/10,19 January 2017,"The story of a man with life torn by successive misfortunes and who behaves himself with a strong emotion most often disguised and repressed but exploding now and then. A movie that intrinsically has much to do with us human beings and with our individual, social and familiar reactions before unhappy events. A man who loses his children in a fire of their home caused maybe for his negligence when he forgot to put the protection before the fireplace and whose wife accuses him of that, destroying their marriage. Later on his beloved brother dies suddenly which puts him as his teenager nephew's guardian with whom he has a relationship with ups and downs. Everything is told and shown in a profusion of sudden flashbacks along with the present story which are deeply revealing of all that happened to this man. Excellent performers playing their roles with greatest quality. One of the best movies produced last year dealing with real human beings and without computer special effects, violence or fantasies, a kind of movie that is rare nowadays.",Manchester by the Sea,4034228
75,bandw,Deserves its awards,10/10,18 March 2017,"The main attraction is Casey Affleck's Oscar-winning performance.When we meet Lee Chandler (Affleck) he is personally closed down, working as a handyman for an apartment complex in Quincy, Massachusetts. He is rude to some of his clients, exhibiting a latent anger. In an early flashback Lee is seen affectionately playing with his nephew Patrick aboard the family's lobster boat. For the first part of the movie I was left to wonder what caused the personality shift, that was a hook that kept my interest until the causative tragic event is revealed in a flashback. Credit has to be given to Affleck since he plays two different characters, the Lee before the event and the Lee afterward.As the story develops the focus is on the relationship between Lee and his nephew Patrick. Lucas Hedges is surprisingly good as the teen-aged Patrick, earning an Oscar nomination. Michele Williams, as Lee's wife Randi, also earned an Oscar nomination; the acting carries this movie a long way. But wait, there is more (as the TV commercials say)--an Oscar win for Kenneth Lonergan's original screenplay and an Oscar nomination for him as best director.There is much more to be appreciated beyond the fine acting and powerful story. Filming the movie in Manchester-by-the-Sea makes that setting an additional character. The environment is often used as counterpoint to some of the emotional scenes--a quick cut to an ocean-scape or the serenity of the small New England town allows for digesting what has gone before. The scenes in local bars add a feeling of authenticity. The light Boston accents ground this in the local environment so that it is hard to picture how the story would play out in a different setting.The cinematography does not call attention to itself beyond being professionally done. On second viewing I paid more attention to the lighting and realized that care had been taken with this, particularly in some of the closeups of faces. The score ranges from Handel and Albinoni to popular. The classical pieces provide counterpoint to some of the more emotional scenes in much the same way that the location shots do.There is no sugarcoating in the portrayal of the effect that tragedy has on Lee's life. Each person deals with grief in his or her own way and I found Lee's behavior believable and understandable. One of the beauties of the story is how subtle hints are given as to potential hope for Lee. The first time he smiles, later in the movie, is a breakthrough. An affectionate pat on Patrick's shoulder signals a minor thawing of Lee's chilly isolation. But the story does not reach any expected conclusion. It is heartbreaking when Lee says to Patrick, ""I can't beat it.""",Manchester by the Sea,4034228
76,SnoopyStyle,one epic scene,8/10,24 March 2017,"Lee Chandler (Casey Affleck), his wife Randi (Michelle Williams), and their children lived happily in Quincy, Massachusetts. His brother Joe (Kyle Chandler) and wife Elise (Gretchen Mol) have son Patrick. Lee suffers a devastating loss which destroys his life. Joe has terminal heart problems. Unbeknownst to Lee, Joe left Patrick to Lee as his guardian. Lee struggles to come to grips with the responsibility.This movie does careen from comedy to sadness to anger to quiet contemplation going from one time to another. I do wish that filmmaker Kenneth Lonergan was able to use a sharper knife in the editing process. With more than two hours, the running time could be squeezed down by at least fifteen minutes. The film is allowed to wallow in its sadness. A tighter film would be more emotionally impactful. There are surprisingly broad comedic scenes mostly with the girlfriend and one epic scene from Michelle Williams. The performances are terrific and this has real heart.

77,midas-jacobs,"Emotionally-heavy, and brilliantly acted film!",10/10,3 March 2017,"Manchester by the Sea has won one of the most deserved Oscars this year, for both the screenplay, but most of all for Casey Affleck's performance as Lee Chandler. In that film he plays a janitor, whose brother has passed away and now he gets to be the guardian of his nephew, but that just doesn't fit entirely in his life.The directing was really good. Kenneth Lonergan was the director. The film is visually very good looking, so was the color grading and framing. He also liked to show a lot of shots of their surroundings to set up the theme of the film, but what Kenneth Lonergan has done in a fantastic manner is to set up the emotional scenes. He brilliantly sets them up, with a slow building score in the background leading up to the ""finally"" of that scene. He really was able to create powerful scenes that'll pull the right emotional strings. The soundtrack overall is very good. It isn't anything mind-blowing, but it does what the movie asks it to do: help to emote the viewer. The editing did contain some flaws, like actors moving very little, but notable between cuts, etc. and the pacing as well could be a bit slow, but I didn't really mind, because the rest of the film was there to keep me entertained, and asking for more.The acting is the main reason why you should go see this film. The main actor, Casey Affleck really was brilliant. His acting was superb, because of the held-back emotion you could see in him, or hardly see in him. He isn't the person, who yells when he's angry or sad, but just keeps it to him. He lets the pain build up inside of him. You could hardly see it, but if you pay close enough attention, you were able to see how he felt. How miserable he was. How damaged he was. His subtle movements, gestures, facial expressions¬Ö all helped with this. He was very subdued and subtle in his performance that I was blown away by him. It was definitely something you should see on the big screen in a theater. Not only Casey Affleck was great, so was Michelle Williams, who played Casey Affleck's ex-wife. She wasn't a lot in the film, but when she was there, she broke my heart. Her acting too was superb and really convincing. I wasn't seeing Michelle Williams and Casey Affleck on the screen, but I saw Randi and Lee Chandler. Lucas Hedges I found to be lesser good. I wouldn't call him bad, but he definitely fell in the shadow of the Affleck and Williams. I don't think that he really earned his Oscar-nomination. Kyle Chandler was fantastic and should've been the one who's nominated for the Oscar for best actor in a supporting role. But the rest of the supporting cast was great as well, whereby it didn't feel like I was watching a movie but that I was watching real people. The screenplay too was absolutely fantastic. I'm not sure if this one deserved the Oscar or ""Hell or High Water"", but either way I am happy with the outcome. The story takes a while to start and seems pretty simple and boring if I would explain it, but how Kenneth Lonergan does it, is magnificent. The story telling in this film is really good. The screenplay wonderfully interwove flashbacks into the story; we got to know Lee and his damaged past piece by piece, whereby you slowly start to unconsciously care more and more about him. Which is something you in the beginning of the film wouldn't expect, because at first he just seems to be a curt man, without any chemistry or likability, but as the movie progresses, you realize that there's more to him. With each flashback scene they add onto the character, building up to one particular flashback. One flashback that to me was the best scene out of the film, and even gave me chills right at the end of it. So if you didn't notice from that part: the characters were amazing as well. They all had their own depth to them and were interesting to see. They felt like real people, because everything that happened to them could've happened to anyone. The dialogue also helped with creating the realistic atmosphere the movie is going for and it absolutely nails that as well. In the end ""Manchester by the Sea"" was one of the best films of last year. Just Casey Affleck's performance is a good reason for seeing this film. He gave his all for this role and so did Michelle Williams. But only go see the film if you know you can handle emotional-heavy films, because this one contains some heavy scenes. That's why I'm giving this one a 9.6/10.",Manchester by the Sea,4034228
78,rblenheim,"Casey Affleck and director Lonergan provides, with humor, one of the screen's great portraits of grief",9/10,22 February 2017,"""Manchester by the Sea"" becomes, amazingly by way of humanistic comedy, one of the most moving portraits of grief the cinema has ever given us. With this film, screenwriter and director Kenneth Lonergan has finally fulfilled the promise of his two previous features, ""You Can Count on Me"" (2000) and ""Margaret"" (2011), the latter a particularly beautiful film (called ""a masterpiece"" by Martin Scorsese) that was finally released after having spent many years drowning in financial problems and various lawsuits over the editing of its final cut.""Manchester by the Sea"" originated from a script idea pitched by producer John Krasinski and actor Matt Damon (in which Damon had intended to star and direct until he signed with Ridley Scott to star in ""The Martian""). Lonergan went on to write and direct this story of a deceptively reserved janitor in Quincy, Massachusetts who becomes obligated to return home to Manchester to care for his nephew after his brother has died, and the subsequent emotional can of worms this opens up in his past. It is a veritable masterpiece due to Lonergan's method of realism which avoids all clich√©s both in scripting and directing, but most of all due to the performances of its perfect cast, of which Casey Affleck as the emotionally-scarred Lee Chandler is the standout, putting in one of the most nuanced and perfectly-modulated performances of recent years. He never allows a single moment of forced poignancy or even obvious empathy, always finding unpredictable, new ways of approaching truth to keep audiences off balance. The supporting cast all perform at the highest level, especially Lucas Hedges as the nephew Patrick, Gretchen Moll as Patrick's 'reformed' substance-abusive mother, and, most of all, Michelle Williams as Lee's estranged wife Randi who, in a minimum of screen time, sears her character into our memory. In fact, one of the great movie scenes of the entire year is when Williams and Affleck confront each other near the end of the film and we feel two hearts irreversibly broken. (And look for Lonergan himself doing a cameo as a pedestrian who accuses Affleck of being a bad parent.)Deceptively unpretentious while it paints its narrative as naturally as daily life, ""Manchester by the Sea"" is one of the great films of 2016.",Manchester by the Sea,4034228
79,nogodnomasters,I cut it,6/10,6 August 2017,"Lee Chandler (Casey Affleck) is a handyman in Quincy. When his brother Joe (Kyle Chandler) passes, Lee returns to Manchester and discovers he is listed as the guardian of his 16 year old nephew Patrick (Lucas Hedges). At 30 minutes into the film we discover he is ""THE"" Lee Chandler and at about an hour we find out why. It is a story about operating outside of your comfort zone and moving on, or not.This is you basic Lifetime type of film. Lucas Hedges (Oscar Nominee) and Michelle Williams were not convincing in their roles, especially during their ""crying"" scenes which bordered on so bad it was funny. After 2 hours and 17 minutes, the film ends and you feel like you are left hanging. Lee is a quiet man who can't open up. He likes to drink and fight. I neither hated nor liked him nor any of the characters. Boring with predictable scenes, such as when the hand went through the window.

80,rtm2007-894-344863,A Dreadful Bore,1/10,16 January 2017,"Perhaps one of the worst films to start the year off with; the film began simply enough, with a few flash backs and a few references to general guiding story lines of the movie, but then it all went downhill from there. In this film, there is not really a climax, nor really any kind of action/plot at all. It is basically Affleck avoiding his past when he has to go and take care of his brother's kid, who is just another awkward twist to the movie. The kid is an egomaniac, who has two girlfriends, is a general jacka** to everyone, and is generally obnoxious during the whole movie. The part that really got me, and several other people who left the movie before it ended (I stayed hoping it was going to get better) was the extremely awkward scenes, or the awkward persona of Casey Affleck. There would be minutes of just sitting around, which became common enough that about 40% of the film is just awkward conversation or awkward encounters, which is probably why such a film with no actual substance lasted a horrifying 2 hours long. And then to top it all off, the Bostonian ethnicity shared by everyone in the movie made every conversation appear like an argument, with great amounts of language, which although trying to accurately portray the regional people, became more of an ear sore for those who can have conversations without abysmal amounts of language.I would give it a 2/10 for the occasional laugh that it gave, but for 2 hours of screen time, I can't find a reason why it would deserve it.(This film is highly rated on this website, but me and most people I have talked to who have seen it all agree it was not that great. It definitely was not a highlight film, so perhaps those who did see it are refreshed by some of the themes? Regardless, I did not enjoy the film, and will be seeing La La Land to make up for it tomorrow.)",Manchester by the Sea,4034228
81,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"""Manchester"" is long and grim, but it's reflective of a difficult and important truth",9/10,29 January 2017,"""Manchester by the Sea"" takes place in the dead of winter in the small Massachusetts coastal town of the title. This bleak setting and the stark, grim imagery that accompany it set the tone for Kenneth Lonergan's third feature film, which explores grief and our darkest demons in a way so authentic it can get uncomfortable at times. Yet its that same level of honesty that gives the film an unexpected sense of humor, a kind of tranquility and a quiet hope.Casey Affleck gives a career-elevating performance as Lee Chandler, a stoic loner living as a residence building janitor in Boston who gets a call that his brother, Joe (Kyle Chandler) is in critical condition. By the time he gets up north to Manchester-by-the-Sea, Joe has died, leaving Lee to look after his 16-year-old nephew, Patrick (Lucas Hedges), and bury his brother, all while fending off painful memories of his past that this town evokes.Although it would seem that ""Manchester by the Sea"" focuses on the grief at hand ‚Äî a man mourning his brother and a son mourning his father ‚Äî the film is actually about other challenges and traumas that Joe's death brings to the surface for these characters. That's what makes Lonergan's story and script so masterful ‚Äî the present day action is only maybe a quarter of the story. What's happening beneath the surface in any given scene is everything else. Lonergan cues us in by splicing in scenes from the past that powerfully inform the present action. As a director and editor, he inserts them rather abruptly and without the sometimes patronizing cues that most filmmakers use to indicate the arrival of a flashback sequence. The transitions are instead rather jarring and require some work on our behalf to sort out, but this echoes the jarring way they interrupt Lee's consciousness as well. Lonergan puts us completely in sync with Lee, setting up Affleck to have tremendous success.Affleck does not miss his opportunity. His performance is understated, brooding and cold, punctuated by a few brief gun shots of emotion. This is not a traditional Oscar bait performance, though much of that thanks can again go to Lonergan for writing the audiences into Lee's skin, affording Affleck a great deal of nuance to work with. It's also in his character's nature to suppress emotion, to stay reserved, and watching an actor push back on emotion proves just as powerful as watching it pour out of them.That's what makes Michelle Williams' performance as Lee's ex-wife such a significant complement. Williams gets pretty minimal screen time, but when she does, it's in her character's nature to open up the flood gates. An encounter between the two characters is the emotional climax of the film for this reason. Other supporting characters also provide alternative perspectives on Lee's struggles, another part of what makes Lonergan's script so outstanding. The most complex dynamic is between Lee and Patrick, the teenager who wants more than anything to keep his life intact: being on the hockey team, playing lead guitar in a rock band and having not one, but two girlfriends. He does have his own struggles beyond needing closure from his dad's death, but it's how his life is affected by the adults, namely Lee, struggling around him that raise the most interesting points. Hedges provides a lot of comic relief, surprisingly, but he brings a lot of maturity to Patrick that helps elevate his relationship with Lee to something beyond the angsty teen and the bachelor uncle that doesn't want to have to deal with him.""Manchester by the Sea"" has some powerful messages, messages that can be hard to hear, especially in the form of a movie that's nearly 140 minutes long and full of nothing but cold, dark imagery to the point that some viewers might walk away with Seasonal Affective Disorder. Yet these are the kind of messages that we need to be reminded of, even at the movies. Grief ‚Äî overcoming the darkest moments that have defined our lives, is not easy. That honesty makes Lonergan's film one of the most important, albeit one of the hardest, movies of the year~Steven CThanks for reading!

82,austin0731,An emotional film that leaves a depressing aftertaste,9/10,31 January 2017,"This film began very slowly, we are introduced to an unlikeable main character played by Casey Affleck. I would admit that I was quite bored by the openings of the film failing to see where this would be going. However at one particular point in to movie where everything comes clear and you understand this character's motives that's when everything starts to click and come into place. This film would probably be great for a second watch because when you fully understand the reasonings behind this character's very glum outlook everything makes so much more sense. Like I said after that point every other scene just build on and on as we follow this character through a path of redemption and a path of trying to forgive himself, as he tries so hard to move on. Obviously along with the amazing and beautiful shots from the coastal towns of Massachusetts all help to tell this beautiful and emotional story. The film's use of flashbacks were really good as well, the film very subtly and swiftly transfers in and out of the past and present, this makes a very compelling way of storytelling and is really made successful due to Casey Affleck's performance, the contrast between that same character before and after this tragedy is remarkable. He so woefully depicts the character in such a different ways it really makes audiences wonder what could possibly have happened (before the reveal) building on tension. And then making audiences feel so sympathetic (after the reveal) towards this character when we see the drastic differences in the character's outlook and behavior. As Michelle Williams' character put so brilliantly, "" My heart was broken, and I know yours is broken, too."" Such a compelling quote, such an amazing delivery. All such performances all contribute to building one of this years biggest Oscar contenders: Manchester by the sea. What makes the film thrive the most is how the film doesn't feel scripted and acted but the actor's are just so real and are portrayed as such real people that it completely sucks you in. Brilliant performances from the entire cast with the underlying tone of this subdued, raw realism makes Manchester by the sea a very worthwhile watch.",Manchester by the Sea,4034228
83,justahunch-70549,A painfully superlative film,10/10,2 January 2023,"This is so difficult to review. I first saw this when it was released back in 2016 and left the theater a mess. I've always wanted to see it again, but a part of me never wanted to see it again. This is a painful film to experience, though I found myself more in control of my emotions the second time as I was braced for what was to come.This is some sort of masterpiece. It all about pain, suffering, depression, tragedy and love and much of that love is not accepted or wanted or feels deserved. This is the sad tale of a man who cannot forgive himself for an accident he was somewhat responsible for. He wanted to be punished, but it did not happen. He wanted to die, but he was stopped. He lives his life simplistically with attachments to no other human beings just waiting for life to be over with, but another tragedy occurs that puts him in the position of having the responsibility of another human being, his 16 year old nephew, and we watch as he tries so hard to what is best for the boy while trying to deal with what he is capable of emotionally. It's a very difficult film to watch.Casey Affleck had already proven to be a good actor when this came around, but the depth he shows here was a surprise. It is a subtle, mostly restrained performance that is galvanizingly realistic. There are others in the film, most prominently Michelle Williams in a small, though very moving role and Lucas Hedges in his first major role and he is excellent, but from beginning to end, this is Affleck's film. He will long be remembered for this. Kenneth Lonergan wrote this awesome screenplay and he directed all of this pain, love and tragedy as well.I love this film. I must be a masochist.",Manchester by the Sea,4034228

85,Benjamin-M-Weilert,Not as sad or as good as I was expecting.,6/10,8 March 2019,"Part of the trouble with the reputation of a film preceding it is the film rarely lives up to the hype. At least, that has been my experience. If I go into a movie with my own idea of what it will be and the movie delivers, I feel it is a good movie. However, if my idea of the movie is skewed based on what I've heard about it, then I might be disappointed if it doesn't match what I was expecting. This is why I'll likely watch a trailer for a film, but I won't read any reviews of it until I've already seen it.For Amazon's successful foray into filmmaking, part of me expected a lot out of Manchester by the Sea (2016). After all, they don't necessarily have to ascribe to the same processes and procedures that hold down other production companies. Add to this my impression that the story of Manchester by the Sea was quite depressing and my mental preparation to watch a sad film. Unfortunately, because the first expectation led to an underwhelming result, the second expectation didn't have the impact I thought it would. Don't get me wrong; there are a lot of elements adding together to try and make the film quite sad. From the plot to the music, the theme of loss is strong throughout. However, the characters soldier on.I'm not sure if it was the often confusing flashbacks or the slow plot progression (they should have just called it ""Casey Affleck drives around in a jeep . . . a lot""), but there was only one truly impactful scene in the film. If the filmmakers were trying to make a movie about an emotionally numb man who successfully deals with the death of his brother, then they have succeeded.Not as sad or as good as I was expecting, I give Manchester by the Sea 3.0 stars out of 5.",Manchester by the Sea,4034228

Up front, I admit to not finishing this movie... because I was so bored and disinterested at the 1hr45min point. I did read the IMDb synopsis to see what I missed, which was evidently NOTHING.The movie started slow, then never gained momentum. The acting by the two main characters was utterly wooden, boring and depressing. I had absolutely no respect for either of them for their self-centric, self-absorbed attitudes and generally rotten treatment of others in their lives. The story utterly never climaxed at all... with no payoff whatsoever for having endured over two hours of depressing, BORING performance.Why so much ""love"" for Casey Affleck by the critics? He was OK in ""Their Finest Hours"" but, after this I'll be steering clear of his films in the future since he is obviously the critic's darling right now- totally overrated.My advice- if you aren't liking this movie within the first 70 minutes, dump it because it doesn't get better and you ain't missing anything.",Manchester by the Sea,4034228

He holds it all together and keeps punching.... literally. He does complexity with every man simplicity and takes us along for his bumpy ride. Substance and style. He lets us into his character and we have mixed emotions about him just like he does. Michelle Williams disappears into every role. A face to launch a thousand scripts. I was thinking of Geraldine Page before her. Another actor/scientist who formulates until we can't tell she's acting. Lucas Hedges was super, transparent and endearing. Young talent aplenty. The chemistry, real or imagined, was due to the talented cast and fine-tuned script by a man who takes his time putting his plays and films together, the wordsmith Kenneth Lonergan.

88,BeneCumb,A good example that statics does not necessarily mean tediousness,8/10,10 November 2017,"As to dynamism on screen, I regard myself an average filmophile - I am not into constant flashes and short scenes, but I do not value long ""profound"" scenes. Reading some local critics, they all praised this movie, but they all stressed that 'nothing really happens in there'. Therefore, I was hesitant to start watching and postponed it until now.But, virtually from the very beginning, I was pleasantly surprised. The benchmark and the development of the plot, great acting (particularly males who are more visible/present, with Casey Affleck leading) and the venue created a nice wholeness towards somewhat Scandinavian approach of depicting circumstances and human relations. Indeed, most of us do not live life full of action, yet deaths of relatives-friends occur, and then you have to move by/on in a way or another. Kenneth Lonergan has found a talented way to ""process"" it, and the viewers just have to follow and ponder on and over how they would act in a similar situation. And will find so much recognition... Definitely, a good movie, with accolades and nominations well deserved; perhaps the ending could have been more ""upsetting"". As for mood and depiction, I would juxtapose it with The Station Agent, yet the latter has more warmth and humor.PS Never believe paid critics - unless you want to miss a good movie :)",Manchester by the Sea,4034228
89,dierregi,Modern tragedy,8/10,10 February 2020,"Lee Chandler is damaged goods. A lonely loner, he is dragged back to his home town by his brother's death. Joe Chandler had a weak heart, an alcoholic ex-wife and a 16 years old son, named Patrick.Joe decided to give Lee guardianship of Patrick, without informing him first. This news, coupled with grief does not make Lee particularly happy.While the relationship between Lee and Patrick evolves uneasily, we learn about Lee's tragic past, the reason for his withdrawn personality and his uneasiness in being back home.The key point of the narrative is that some tragedies cannot find a resolution and that even when others forgive you, the most difficult part of starting over is forgiving yourself.
