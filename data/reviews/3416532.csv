0,bob-the-movie-man,"""I'll. Be. Right. Here.""",9/10,5 January 2017,"The worst thing about this movie is its title. The second worst thing about this movie is its trailer. Both will either a) put people off seeing it (it succeeded in that with my wife for example) or b) make people conclude it is a 'nice holiday film to take the kids to', which is also an horrendous mistake!This is a crying shame because it is a riveting drama and a superb piece of film-making that may well catapult it already into my top 10 films of 2017. But it is not, I would suggest, a film that is remotely suitable for kids under 10 to see, dealing as it does with terminal illness, bullying and impending doom. For this is a dark (read pitch black) but hauntingly beautiful film.Lewis MacDougall, in only his second film (after last year's ""Peter Pan"") plays Conor - a young but talented and sensitive artist growing up as a 12 year old in the North of England with his single mum (Felicity Jones). She is suffering from an aggressive form of cancer and is forever medically grasping for a new hope (D'ya see what I did there?). Young Conor believes fervently that each new treatment will be 'the one' but the building tension, the lack of sleep and his recurrent nightmares are destroying him mentally and physically. As if this wasn't enough, his distracted nature is leading to him being seriously bullied at school and there is the added stress of having to live in his grandmother's pristine and teen-unfriendly house when his mother is hospitalised. Towering over the nearby graveyard on the hill is an ancient yew tree and Conor is visited after midnight by this ""monster"" (voiced by Liam Neeson). Is he dreaming, or is it real? The tree dispatches wisdom in the form of three 'tales', with the proviso that Conor tell the tree the fourth tale which ""must be the truth"".A tale of grief, guilt and a search for closure, this is a harrowing but rewarding journey for the viewer. The film is technically outstanding on so many levels:the art design is superb, with the gorgeous 'tale animations' being highly reminiscent of the beautiful ones in ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1""; the use of sound is brilliant, with sudden silence being used as a weapon with which to assault the senses in one key sequence; - the cinematography by Oscar Faura (""The Imitation Game"") is faultless, capturing both the dreary reality in a Northern winter with the comparative warmth of the strange dream-like sequences;the music by Fernando Velázquez is used effectively and intelligently to reflect the sombre mood; the special effects team led by Pau Costa (""The Revenant"", ""The Impossible"") shines not just with Neesen's monster, but with the incorporation of the root and branch effects into the 'normal' surroundings. As the BFG illustrated, having a whole film carried by a young actor is a bit of an ask, but here Lewis MacDougall achieves just that like a seasoned pro. His performance is nothing short of staggering and - although a brave move by the Academy - it would be great to see him nominated for a BAFTA acting award for this.Confirming her position in the acting top-flight is Felicity Jones, heart-wrenching in her role of the declining mum, and Sigourney Weaver is also excellent as the po-faced but grief-stricken grandmother. Liam Neeson probably didn't add much by getting dressed up in the mo-cap suit for the tree scenes, but his voice is just perfect as the wise old sage.The only criticism of what is an absorbing and intelligent script is the introduction of Conor's Dad, played by Toby Kebbell (Dr Doom from ""The Fantastic 4""), who is literally flown in from LA on a flying visit but whose role is a little superfluous to the plot. This is exactly what ""The BFG"" should have been but wasn't. It draws on a number of potential influences including ""Mary Poppins""/""Saving Mr Banks"" and ""ET"". Wise, clever and a thing of beauty from beginning to end, this is a treat for movie-goers and a highly recommended watch. However, if you have lost someone to ""the Big C"" be aware that this film could be highly traumatic for you..... or highly cathartic: as I'm not a psychiatrist, I'm really not that sure! Also, if you are of the blubbing kind, take LOTS of tissues: the film features the best use of a digital clock since ""Groundhog Day"" and if you are not reduced to tears by that scene you are certifiably not human.

1,Blue-Grotto,Only truths will quench the fires of the heart,9/10,16 October 2016,"A scary looking tree in the middle of a graveyard haunts the dreams of a little boy, Conor, who already has enough troubles while awake. A mother (Felicity Jones) with terminal cancer, bullies, absent father, dictatorial grandma (Sigourney Weaver) and now a threatening monster (Liam Neeson) to visit him at night; poor Conor does not have a lot going for him. On the plus side, the monster has only three stories to tell, yet when finished he insists that Conor tell a story of his own that reveals the truths in his heart. The monster's stories touch upon themes gnawing at Conor; the good and bad in every person, the consequences of actions and an invisible man who becomes more invisible by being seen. Still Conor refuses to acknowledge the truths. ""You don't know me,"" he shouts ""these stories are not real!"" The monster then lays down the law, ""I know everything about you, now speak the truth or die!""A Monster Calls includes some amazing visual effects, fantastic scenes and brilliant dialogue. The film explores in compelling and thrilling ways how fantasy combines with reality, how people deal with their fears (for better and worse) and the tremendous power of stories. The actors are convincing and captivating and Neeson's voice is mesmerizing. You'd rob a bank if his voice told you to. Animation is used to illustrate the monster's stories. A Monster Calls is based on a novel by Patrick Ness. Seen at the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival.",A Monster Calls,3416532

3,kosmasp,Sweet Monster of mine,9/10,21 May 2021,"Sweet may not be the right word here, but I was trying to refer to a song and make a joke with that - if you are able to indulge that. A very moving drama we have here, with not as much comedy or humor as I may make it look like. With Liam Neeson as voice of that said monster, we get the story of a boy who is cannot accept that his mother is ill. And we can all connect and feel with what the boy goes through.Seeing a light at the end of the tunnel and hoping he might get help - or rather that the his mother will receive help for her illness. Life is not easy - and sometimes having an escape in fantasy can help. Not going full on - well there is a fine line of course. But everyone deals differently with bad news ... and our boy here seems to have his rich imagination to go back to ... but is it just his imagination? By the way really well done special effects.A great story, not always easy to watch, but one that engages with the viewer who can go into a different mind set and world.",A Monster Calls,3416532
4,jadepietro,A Grimm Tale Indeed,8/10,16 January 2017,"￼(RATING: ☆☆☆☆ out of 5)THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED. IN BRIEF: A visually stunner caught up in the undergrowth of its own conventional storytelling.GRADE: BSYNOPSIS: A child suffers the harsh realities of life and retreats to another world.JIM'S REVIEW: J. A. Bayona's A Monster Calls is a visually imaginative downer of a tale about a young boy who must learn to cope with grief. Based on the award-winning children's book by Patrick Ness and adapted by the author himself, the film uses animation and live action to tell its tale of woe. The results of this dark tale are enlightened by stylish direction and a highly effective performance by newcomer. Lewis MacDougall.Mr. MacDougall plays Conor O'Malley whose life is filled with too many harsh realities: a mother suffering from terminal cancer (Felicity Jones), a distant grandmother (Sigourney Weaver) and a more distant father (Toby Kebbell), a cruel bully (James Melville). Real life offers no solitude, so Conor retreats to an imaginary world which brings with it a giant yew monster (Liam Neeson). During his visits, the tree creature provides some respite for Conor. He gives him sage advice by telling some stories to help this child through the darkness to find some solace in the real world. ￼A Monster Calls is more of an allegory and the film's narrative structure uses the format of interspersing animated vignettes as parables to the parallel story of Conor and his terminally-ill mother. Yes, the film is manipulative from the start, with its undeniable melodramatic set-up and ultimately tragic conclusion. The real world story is dull and so relentless in its brooding melancholia compared to the free-spirited other worldly realm and, at times, this reviewer wanted to stay in the latter. But the filmmakers treat their serious subject with such dignity and honesty, avoiding the maudlin and sentimental for the most part. There is so much to admire about Mr. Bayona's film. (The subject is not an easy task to sell to the general public. Not surprisingly, the movie is doing lackluster business in the States, although globally it is doing well. Nowadays, American moviegoers are looking to escape reality, such like the main character.)Technically, the film soars. From Oscar Fuura's stunning photography to Fernando Velazquez's haunting music score, the film looks death squarely in the face and celebrates life. Seamlessly edited by Benat Vilplana and Jaume Marti, A Monster Calls uses its sumptuous visuals to its advantage. With swirls of bright watercolor washes adding a vibrancy to the film's story-within- a story format, the film efficiently contrasts the real from the unreal. Kudos to director Bayona and his team of artisans on their handling of this delicate theme.The lead performances are all first-rate, Mr. Neeson voices the Monster perfectly and his motion capture performance is wonderful and so heartfelt. Ms. Jones brings superb understatement to her role as Conor's sickly parent. Her chemistry with Mr. MacDougall seems genuine and authentic. This young actor, in his film debut, is remarkable and runs the full gamut of emotions without one false note. Providing supporting work in their rather stock roles are Ms. Weaver and Mr. Kebbell who are merely serviceable, possibly due to the writing and characters.￼A Monster Calls is indeed a Grimm tale, but one that deserves your attention. And be forewarned, bring a hankie with you.",A Monster Calls,3416532
5,joshbarton15,One of the most emotionally powerfully films I've seen in a while,10/10,10 December 2016,"Based on the novel of the same name by Patrick Ness, A Monster Calls is one of the most emotionally powerful films I've seen in a long time. Directed by J. A. Bayona, this is a film you'll want to be making sure you have a pack of tissues ready for. Conor O'Malley (Lewis MacDougall) lives at home with his terminally ill mother (Felicity Jones). Bullied relentlessly at school on a daily basis and with no friends, Lewis finds himself spending most of the free time he does have helping his mother.One night, Conor encounters a monster (Liam Neeson) in the form of a giant yew tree. With the help of the monster, Conor learns a number of valuable life lessons, as well as facing the nightmarish reality he knows will come soon enough.Reports of A Monster Calls causing audiences to flood theatres with tears during the festival circuit have been well documented however, even they couldn't prepare me for J. A. Bayona's stunningly beautiful film. The warning of emotional distress was even there for all to see as the classification certificate appeared on screen prior to the film.This is an incredibly moving story, depressing for the most part however, thanks to the fantasy elements of the story and the relationship Lewis has with the monster, it can be strangely uplifting at times. The film packs one hell of an emotional punch towards the end but it doesn't just spring it on the audience because you can sense that is exactly where it's going from the very beginning.The performances of Felicity Jones, Sigourney Weaver and Toby Kebbell are all good but there is no debating here that the film ultimately belongs to the young Lewis MacDougall, who manages to deliver a performance that would make you think he's been acting for years, when this is in fact only his second film. MacDougall really makes you empathise with Conor and his performance in the final stages of the film is sensational.The visuals deserve a special mention as well, the monster in particular brought to life quite brilliantly through special effects and a gruff vocal performance from Liam Neeson. They go hand- in-hand with Bayona's visionary style as a director to make A Monster Calls a must-see film.",A Monster Calls,3416532
6,kraytdragon-sean,Emotionally Honest,9/10,5 January 2017,"A Monster Calls is the rare movie geared toward a younger demographic which refuses to pull an emotional punch. The movie explicitly states that the protagonist, Connor O'Malley, is ""too old to be a kid and too young to be a man"". The introductory tagline is the perfect way to relay the film's tone to the audience. From the brutally honest acting to the gorgeously animated ""stories"", A Monster Calls allows raw emotion to emanate from the experience. Magic on the screen happens due to the unique specificity of our hurt hero. The fantastical elements found in a typical family movie organically merge with the painful reality of adulthood. For example, a fight will begin building up in Connor and the anger will call out the monster. The monster is never a simple vicarious outlet for the young adult. Instead, the monster is a well-executed manifestation of perceived guilt towards a deeper truth. Liam Neeson's monster revels in the humanity of the moment while also holding a magnifying glass up to it. Life continues to get worse for Connor and each appearance leads to a gradual slip of harsh reality. Refreshingly, A Monster Calls never hides that uncovering important personal insight is a painful process. The climax makes up for one of the most touching revelatory moments in modern cinema. The value of the film is revealed in how both children and adults in the audience gain a better understanding of the inherently personal nature of grief. The way we deal with a loss can come across as something else entirely for ourselves. A wide release of the film will hopefully begin to kindle in an audience a desire for introspective cinema. In a sense, specific scenarios are able to paradoxically tap into a universally human truth. Movies like A Monster Calls show a better alternative to the next soulless generic blockbuster movie.",A Monster Calls,3416532
7,assassin-42523,Absolutely blown away,9/10,14 December 2016,"When I first walk into theater, I was not expecting much of this. Yeah, the first moments were so cliché I thought this would just be a mediocre movie at best. But after the movie, everything changed, and this became one of the best movies I've seen in years The director use beautifully rendered CGI to deliver the emotions of a struggling young boy coping with reality. It was already a hard concept that few movie successfully delivered, and yet he make so many people I know broke down in tears. Moreover, he also make use of the visual to express the incredibly complicated yet meaningful plot of the movie, constantly changing between fantasy and reality, truth and lies, acceptance and the growing of a boy into adulthood. The main actor while only a young man has already show signs of greatness, you can only wonder if he had already gone through all of this. He also actually took the time to developed each character, making the audiences attach to each and everyone of them. Which is why the ending was even more dramatic and sad for many of us And the soundtrack, oh man, the soundtrack just hit me where it really feels, this is probably the best part of this movie. Whether it's total silence for contemplation of characters or full- on orchestral work for the climax or the sad violin, man, they totally nailed it.",A Monster Calls,3416532
8,MattBrady099,A Monster Calls - Movie Review,8/10,13 November 2016,"""There is not always a good guy. Nor is there always a bad one. Most people are somewhere in between.""Before seeing the movie, I didn't know much about ""A Monster Calls"". The only information I got from it is that it's based on Patrick Ness novel and the trailer had a ""Iron Giant"" vibe to it. I also liked the director (Juan Antonio Bayona) previous movies, so I guess that's what peaked my interest in seeing it. And I came out pretty surprised of how good it was. Not just that, but how moving and heartfelt it was.Juan Antonio Bayona is the type of director that knows how to tell a compelling story in his films. To screw lose the sentiment, until your eyes are filled with water to the point where you can't help but spill out. And in this movie he dose exactly that and how smart he was with it's decisions of the emotional scenes.There's a lot of great actors in this and none of them are put to waste. Liam Nesson was excellent as The Monster. Sigourney Weaver was great as the Grandma. Felicity Jones and Toby Kebbell were also great as Connor parents. But I think the real stand is Lewis MacDougall as (Connor). Even at the age of 14 this kid literally carries this movie and really dose reflect Connor's inner conflict.That's what I notice in Bayona movies. All of the kid actors in his movies are pretty solid and I would go as far to say that they better than the adults. This is very rare for me to say that, because most kid actors suck. Yes there are good ones out there, but only some, as most of them don't fully bring their all.The visual effect's were pretty stunning and impressive of how it interacted with the real environment that it was in. In all honesty, I was pretty surprised. And what I mean by ""surprise"" is that I was expecting The Monster itself to be the only effect in the movie. Because The Monster tells three stories to Conner and all three are done in a visual dye artwork that's beautiful to look at. It's good to be surprise.For problems I had with the movie are slim, but if I had to pick, I would probably say that films message can be a little repetitive and oblivious towards the end. I think that may bug some people. But still, it's a great message that's speaks the truth and actually sticks to it. I mean, if the message was terrible or nothing special, then this might be a big complaint. The film doesn't have an happy ending and neither a sad one. There's no Hollywood ending or anything like that. It would say it's mixed.Overall rating: ""A Monster Calls"" is entertaining, sad, and unforgettable tale that sticks with you after it's over. The film tells the truth and nothing but the truth of life. You want everything to be alright for this kid, but you're left with a feeling of stillness. Like you can't do anything about it, even with all the magical things that's happening. It just gotta let it happen....that's life.",A Monster Calls,3416532
9,Heyitsbennett,Beautiful. Heartbreaking. Healing.,9/10,26 January 2021,"I just went through a massive grief episode about a week before I watched this movie, so I was a little nervous it would make me cry and feel it all over again. And yup, it definitely made me cry, but in a healing way. The message in this movie is beautiful and healing and incredibly real for those who have gone through grief. It helped me heal while listening to the stories and message in this movie, and at the end I felt calm and relief. This movie was a physical description of everything I've felt bottled inside, and it was cathartic to see it play out so perfectly on screen. Incredible.

10,Harun_Karali,"Eccentric, Eerie and Hauntingly Beautiful",10/10,10 September 2016,"As a fan of J.A. Bayona's previous work ""The Impossible"", I had fairly high expectations for this and to say that I am astonished would be an understatement. ""A Monster Calls"" is based on the book that Patrick Ness published in 2011. After this breathtaking adventure I assure you, You will be inclined to read the book. As this is an adventure that builds on your emotions and thrives on your imagination. Conner is a young man that is trying to cope with the fact that his mother who is diagnosed with a terminal illness isn't long for this world. But as his mind races with fears and his imagination takes hold, he creates a creature that would give adults nightmares, But as he realizes the creature is friendly, He grows close to the ""monster"".This is one of those movies that must be seen in theaters, mainly because it's two hours of escape from reality, where you can turn the page back, to a time where your imagination used to run wild. A time when, your biggest responsibilities were picking up your socks. In other words, a time when you were really free.",A Monster Calls,3416532
11,abrojosaputro,One of the most impressive coming of age story I've ever seen,10/10,14 October 2016,"Been quite long since the last time I wrote something about anything, but I guess this one deserves a bit more words than others.Every once in a while you might watch something that absorbed you completely and got you thinking about it. Not because it's perfect but because it touched you personally.A Monster Calls tells a story about a boy named Conor who has to cope with his mom's illness while going through his adolescence. Sounds like a typical coming-of-age story, but it's not. Bayona has created one of a kind, exquisite, complex and profound story for all ages while at the same time didn't forget to look gorgeous (I'd totally buy their watercolor artworks) and well-acted. The most impressive part of the movie for me wasn't the technicality but the emotion and imagination involved while creating this.But at the end of the day, Bayona won me over simply by reminding us all that sometimes it's when you hold something closest to you that you're finally able to let it go.",A Monster Calls,3416532
12,almaric777,Yew can do it,8/10,24 October 2017,"I don't know who you would market this movie to. It's not a kid's movie, tho it tries very hard to look like one. It's not an adult movie (a boy and a talking tree), tho its themes certainly are mature. Both child and adult will squirm under the relentless emotional requirement with only a faint wisp of humor to lighten things up. Melancholy overload anyone? No? But if you make it to the end, you'll have received an unexpected cathartic cleansing and a life lesson in your pocket that is hard, but beautiful in its truth.Once you stop blubbering, that is.

13,RforFilm,"Like an true nightmare, A Monster Calls has a lot of dark beauty within it's tragedy",10/10,9 January 2017,"The traces of crayon and markers on paper will tell you a lot of thing you need to know about the child that drew it. You'd be surprised by how much a drawing of a horse or a sloppy house can tell what any kid would like. I remember during the third grade, my teacher noted several sketches I've done of space aliens and flying pizzas invading over an unnamed city. She actually asked if this was supposed to be about a fear of meeting new people and by going back to a slice of cheese pizza, I was ignoring new things. I only said that I liked aliens and pizza.As I've said, drawings may not always say a lot, but they do something. It depends on the person and the emotions their going through. I can only interpret that my crude sketch only said that I was board and would rather make up something weird to pass the time. My friend too did his own drawings, but his were a lot darker. Whenever I asked, he simply said, ""their just cool"", despite that their darker imagery frightened me. It would be several years later when I found out that his father had passed away. Perhaps A Monster Calls reflects perfectly well what my friend went through.Twelve-year-old Conner O'Malley (played by Lewis MacDougall) loves his mother and does his best to care for her, given her terminal illness and his determination to see her get better. His mother Lizzie (played by Felicity Jones) has told her son several stories and encouraged his artistic talent. His grandmother (played by Sigourney Weaver) also does her best to tend to her daughter and grandson, even though Conner see's her as something of an unsympathetic witch. On top of that, Conner is also the target of a bully.One evening at the strike of 12:07, he sees a giant, tree-like creature rise out of a church graveyard and comes to the boy's house. The monster (voiced by Liam Neeson) tells Conner that he'll tell him three stories and that when the time comes, a fourth must be given in return. Though Conner see's this creature in a reoccurring nightmare, he shows no fear, probably due to his early maturity. In conjunction with the Monster's visits, Conner's grandmother and father (played by Toby Kebbell) come to realize that Lizzie may not make it much longer. Conner allows the monster to tell him the stories, with the hope that his mother can be saved. When I was watching A Monster Calls, I was surprised by how much it made me think about Where The Wild Things Are. Not because their similar movies, but because their both family oriented movies that feel very mature and adult. This is what I like about A Monster Calls. Like a lot of nightmares one would have, the visions that the child has of the monster (which is cool looking, though he looks similar to Groot from Guardians of the Galaxy) connect incredibly well to the events that he's going through. It's a master class of great screen writing and editing.A Monster Calls will defiantly feel heavy to a lot of kids that are going to see this. Their going find themselves watching something sad, but I hope that parents see this as important. Lewis MacDougall manages to carry a lot of the heavy emotions that the story requires of him and pulls off a performance that's better then a lot of adult actors. As an audience member, I wanted to see where his story was going to go and was sad to see it end. You know a movie is good when your sad that it ended.I'll give this ten sketches of the monster out of ten. I can't stress with how beautiful this movie is. It's full of story that should help a lot of people going through with someone's terminal illness or their own. I can only say that this is geared towards older kids (probably over the age of ten would be best) and I doubt that they won't get something out of this. See if A Monster Calls is worthy of your life story and check it out.",A Monster Calls,3416532
14,Coventry,A Successor for Tim Burton and Neil Jordan stood up,8/10,9 December 2019,"I'm very grateful to this particular Belgian TV-station for broadcasting ""A Monster Calls"" last weekend, but at a certain point during the film, I also came quite close to suing them. The reason for this is that they announced the film as a fantasy-adventure for the entire family. I can assure, however, that my two children (aged 10 and 4) were practically traumatized by the sight of the tree-monster, and that my wife (aged 38) consumed nearly three boxes of Kleenex handkerchiefs whilst crying over the sad plot. Just to say that ""A Monster Calls"" is an intense and totally absorbing film; - which is positive again in the end, though. Personally, I'm a tremendous admirer of so-called ""adult fairytales"" and gazed at ""A Monster Calls"" with pure admiration. The narration and atmosphere are reminiscent to some of the best (older) work of master story-tellers, like Tim Burton (""Edward Scissorhands"", ""Sleepy Hollow"") and Neil Jordan (""The Company of Wolves"", ""Ondine""), and the special effects are - by lack of a better word - stupendous! With this film, Spanish director J.A. Bayona (""The Orphanage"") profiles himself as the only worthy successor of the two aforementioned geniuses, and I sincerely hope he'll make more fantasy/fairytales like this.Also, I don't know who came up with the idea, but it was a downright brilliant idea to cast Liam Neeson as the voice of the Monster. He emerges as a humongous tree, with a mission to teach a few valuable life-lessons to 12-year-old Connor. The boy's life certainly isn't easy. His beloved mother is slowly but surely dying from cancer, his father lives in the US but only comes to visit, and he's being bullied at school. With its harsh and confronting ""stories"", the Monster teaches Connor that happy endings aren't real and that enemies aren't always who they seem. Obviously ""A Monster Calls"" primarily aims at making the audience feel emotional and cry, but nevertheless, I've rarely seen a film that so open and honest deals with sensitive topics like terminal illness and trauma acceptance. The monster's stories are wondrously animated, the British countryside looks grim and depressing, and the performances are very powerful. 14-year-old Lewis MacDougall carries the film remarkably well, although with sublime support from Felicity Jones (as the mother) and Sigourney Weaver (as the grandmother).",A Monster Calls,3416532
15,nogodnomasters,I know everything you want to say without you saying it out loud,8/10,6 August 2017,"Connor (Lewis MacDougall) has it rough. Bullied at school, living with a single mom (Felicity Jones) dying from cancer. Connor is visited by a monster Treebeard-Groot who tells him stories in order to help Connor cope. The bottom line is life and people are complex, not all good or bad. This sets you up for that same warm and fuzzy feeling you had when Old Yeller died.This is a well done story, good original plot line, and great acting. Interesting side note Liam Neeson did both the voice of the monster and the Lion in Narnia, by C,S. Lewis. Lewis inspired the voice for Treebeard and the monster was a tree type monster. Okay, maybe it wasn't that interesting to you.The emotional ride is fairly intense. I am not sure if younger kids should see it.

16,rgkarim,A Monster Calls Tears To The Eyes,9/10,8 January 2017,"Robbie K back again with another review. This time, as you can read from the site, we cover A Monster Calls, another novel based movie that may have flown under the radar for most of you viewers. Many reviews are calling it an unforgettable adventure and a new masterpiece for the ages, but the question always remains if the advertisements are true. So, let's dig up these roots and uncover the mystery of the tree monster as we review the latest film. LIKES:  The Acting  The Emotional Story  The Beautiful ArtworkA Monster Calls has many good elements about it, but the first like is the acting of both CGI and realistic characters. Lewis McDougall leads the way as Conor, and plays the isolated child with the weight of the world on his shoulder fantastically, especially in regards to the way he looks lost in his mind. Felicity Jones impresses me as well as the caring mother going through some very trying times. I can't tell how much is the look and how much is her ability portray suffering, but the woman's abilities continue to impress me. And Liam Neeson as the monster is a welcome addition, as his rugged voice is a perfect match for the design of the creature that somehow is filled with so much wisdom (hello flora version of Asland). Solid acting is a good start, but the story was even more captivating to me. A Monster Calls' plot is an emotional forest, filled to the brim with tear jerking sequences that will leave many faces wet. For me, it was because many of these problems are relatable, and were presented in that theatrical manner (e.g. using a powerful music score) that hits you from all fronts. And as the tale progresses, the suspense only continues to build and bring you into the story. But this isn't just necessarily a movie centered on entertaining you with drama, but once more tries to teach you lessons as the relationship between boy and monster begins to form. The tales that the Monster brings out are prime lessons in the error of perception, the folly of judgement, and the importance of empathy. These lessons aren't just randomly thrown in, but go along with the main story and help build to the conclusion. But my favorite aspect, as well as many reviewers', is the artwork of the movie. The real- life scenes contain beautiful settings, alongside the efficient use of filters to help add some subtle emotion to the scenes. Yeah, I know nothing special, right? Heck even the monster, despite how well animated and designed he is doesn't hit the super unique animation. However, what is impressive is the art styles used to portray the monster's lessons. Two of the tales use different animations styles to visualize the moral lessons, using brilliant colors, broad strokes, and warped figures to add a haunted twist to the normal fairy tales. The well-timed breaks from the mundane real life visuals helps add that whimsical side to the story and help reenergize the audience in this otherwise exhausting movie. DISLIKES:  Incredibly Sad Movie  Predictable Ending You don't want to see coming  Would have Liked the Third Story to Have the animation It is hard to find fault in this movie, because the movie is edited so well and feels like a visualization of a well-developed book. However, one big thing is the depressing cloud that looms over the entire movie. We all know movies that depress us, but most have those ray of hope moments that break the clouds of dismay. Not the case in this film. Despite some of the more colorful experiences shown in the trailers, A Monster Calls is not the fun loving, animated adventure you might think it is. It's a very sad film, and there are few moments to help distract you from what is to come. Yes, there is a massively predictable ending and one you wish wasn't the case. I can't say much more, but the ending (while adding suspense and tying things together) is something that teases at the back of your mind and further plays hacky sack with your emotions. A final, albeit minor dislike, is that I would have liked a third art style for the final story. While the third tale is very well done, it does not have the same art theme the others do. I would have loved for them to finish with that same creativity, in a manner that mirrors the theme of the lesson. Again, in the grand scheme it doesn't matter, but that third style would have been a welcome addition to an already beautiful movie. The VERDICTA Monster Calls is the first film to make me tear up in my years of doing reviews. It's stunning example of the visual prowess of art, that is well crafted to tell a story that will pull at many heart strings. However, be warned that this movie is not your typical animated monster meets boy adventure tale, but one that is meant to teach us some rather important, albeit darker, lessons about life. Is it worth a trip to the theater? I think so because of the visual styles and the roller coaster ride of feelings this movie will generate. If you can't find the time though then hit this one on Redbox when you can. My scores are:Drama/Fantasy: 9.0 Movie Overall: 8.0",A Monster Calls,3416532
17,classicsoncall,"""Let me tell you a tale of when I came walking.""",10/10,1 July 2017,"I hardly even know where to begin describing this film. It's emotionally riveting and a profoundly sad experience at the same time, a picture I wouldn't consider suitable for very young kids, even though the main protagonist, Conor O'Malley (Lewis MacDougall) is only twelve years old himself. The 'Monster' in the story, voiced by Liam Neeson, arrives at moments of extreme stress in young Conor's life, with a series of three tales that tend more to confuse and obfuscate, rather than offer clarity to Conor's fear of losing his mother (Felicity Jones) to a deadly cancer. Compelled to relate a true story of his own back to The Monster, Conor is forced to deal with the truth of his situation. The story is one of hanging on and letting go at the same time, and is not an easy kind of movie to sit through. Not because of it's pacing or structure, but just because it's so heart rending in the way it deals with Conor's grief and anger. Not everyone will find the picture worthwhile, those who manage to stick with it will experience a sublime truth in trusting one's feelings in the face of tragedy and knowing they are real, even if painful. For the particularly sensitive, keep a box of Kleenex handy.",A Monster Calls,3416532
18,Muzan03,"""And if you need to break things, then by God, you break them.""",8/10,9 November 2016,"As someone who had read the book and really liked it, I found the movie as compelling and it excels at additions that are not in the novel such as the last scene which happened after the ending of the book. However, they also removed some good parts from the book, but were offset by visuals and score and the spot on performances of the characters especially Lewis MacDougall (Conor) who nailed his role in the movie. He sure knows how to cry. And that needs pointing out as a lot of kids in movies are sometimes annoying and difficult to watch. Felicity Jones (The Theory of Everything) and Sigourney Weaver (Aliens) who were both Academy Award Best Actress nominees were as good as anyone would expect them to be. And Liam Neeson's voice was the perfect choice for the monster's. Haunting, cold, deep, and soothing. Also, the other thing I found striking was how the book played out as a movie. Aside from a few differences (the adds and minuses), almost everything else is as what the book is. Impactful scenes as how they were narrated and readers imagine them to be and dialogue and life lessons as how they were said in the book were same as in the movie. If you have read and liked the book, then watch this. If you have not, watch it still, as long as you have a heart and know what you're getting into, chances are you'll like this gem of a movie.",A Monster Calls,3416532

22,morrison-dylan-fan,A Monster Answers.,10/10,12 August 2017,"In 2016,this film along with The Girl With All The Gifts and The Survivalist were the two main films that I wanted to see on the big screen, but was unable to find them being shown anywhere near me at a good time. Coming up to my 1,500th review,I decided it was the perfect time to finally call the monster.The plot:Whilst holding onto hope with his mum that she can win her battle with cancer,Conor has to take care of keeping the house tidy himself, (where he gets told off by grandma) and also finds the school bullies turning him into an ""invisible boy"" in school. One night Conor gets a visit from an old yew tree in the area which has turned into a Monster. Putting Conor in his hands,the Monster tells Conor that over the next few nights he will tell Conor three stories which he has to figure out the meaning behind. Agreeing to this,Conor is then told by the Monster that he himself must tell a fourth story, which will lead to Conor facing his greatest fear. View on the film:For her lone non-franchise role of 2016, Felicity Jones gives a brilliant, drained performance as the mum, whose frail grasp on life Jones uses in open body language to show the love she has for Conor keeps her fighting. Taking the roots of the film at only 14 years old, Lewis MacDougall gives an outstanding performance as Conor,with MacDougall giving Conor a mix of maturity in caring for his mum, and a burning ball of rage of being unable to improve the situation. Each entering as outsiders, Sigourney Weaver gives an earthy performance as Grandma, whilst Liam Neeson towers above the house in a performance deep with gravitas as the Monster.Completing the novel after author Siobhan Dowd died from breast cancer,the debut screenplay by Patrick Ness beautifully balances dark Fantasy with a heart-felt family Drama. Separating the encounters between Conor and the Monster into segments, Ness makes each story the Monster tells reveal aspects of Conor that he does not want to face. Respectfully treating mums battle with cancer,Ness avoids any drop of Melodrama to keep the struggle that the family are facing grounded,from the uncomfortable silences of Conor and his mum having difficult relationships with grandma and Conor's dad, (played by a very good Toby Kebbell) to Conor having to face his nightmare of seeing his mum get released from the pain.Painting the Monsters tales on the screen,director J.A. Bayona and cinematographer Oscar Faura take each tale off the page with richly macabre, Eastern European puppet-inspired animation, backed by an icy score from Fernando Velázquez. Continuing on themes shown in 2012's powerful The Impossible, Bayona seamlessly blends a stylised poetic quality with a dazzling emotional rawness, with the meetings between Conor and the Monster being covered in fading reds and browns. For his major theme of the torn family unit, Bayona elegantly uses extended takes and close-ups on half faces to capture the bond between Conor and his mum,as Conor learns the meanings of the monster calls.",A Monster Calls,3416532
23,phoenix_lament-38074,This is not a kids' movie. Its a child's story. Do not deny yourself that.,9/10,29 January 2017,"This movie will give words to your grief. It will open you up, lay you bare, and take out that little pack of grief inside you, hold it up against light and show you how it looks from up close. What its made of. What is its texture. It will give a name to your feelings, a face to your emotions. Give yourselves this movie's insight.What NOT to assume about the movie: Do not take this movie by its name. Or its trailer. This is not a kids' movie. Its a child's story. Do not take it as an attempt at a tear jerker. Do not take it as a run-of-the-mill art movie. Do not take it as anything you have seen before. It WILL shake you. Your insides. Your core. Your hands will not move to fast forward once, even when there is no action and no flashy fight scenes. Beware, in the era of more visuals than substance, your ears will surprisingly listen. Your eyes will watch. You will want to know what happens, and how, even when you know it. The emotions are the most red form of raw. They have been wrenched apart from real life and placed in front of the camera as they were. The actors, for this brilliance, deserve a thank you beyond the scope of my expression. This movie holds a different meaning for everyone. If you have never felt personal grief, it will shock you by what its like when the stakes are high. If you have personally suffered, you will find yourself saying 'oh this is so true.this is how it was.'Thats how it was for me, who has lost dear ones personally, and my husband, who hasn't. When Conor's truth was revealed, my husband gasped 'how could he?' while I smiled painfully, understanding exactly what Conor meant. These reactions were simultaneous and worlds apart, while we were watching the same movie at the same time.Watch it. In a world of fantastic beasts and assassin's creeds, give your soul a chance.

24,dave-mcclain,"""A Monster Calls"" is an original, dark, beautiful, entertaining and even therapeutic film.",8/10,14 January 2017,"In 2016's dark fantasy drama ""A Monster Calls"" (PG-13, 1:48), the titular creature is a European yew tree which takes on human form when summoned by a person or when needed to perform some necessary function. That type of tree turns out to be an especially good choice for a monster – especially in this story. Yew trees are very large, some reaching a height of 100 feet and a trunk diameter of 20 feet. For centuries, the yew tree has been planted in church yards, due to the symbolic significance of its longevity. The yew's leaves are poisonous, but elements of the bark have been used effectively in the treatment of cancer. As you are about to read, all of this plays into the original story told in this movie.Conor O'Malley (Lewis MacDougall, from 2015's ""Pan"") is a very troubled 12-year-old. He is bullied by his classmates in his British prep school, especially by a boy named Harry (James Melville), who physically and emotionally abuses the lad on a regular basis. Conor's parents are divorced and his father (Toby Kebbell) moved to Los Angeles and started a new family. Conor's grandmother (multiple Oscar nominee Sigourney Weaver) is strict and cold, but Conor is forced to spend more time with her due to the illness of Conor's mother, Lizzie (Oscar nominee Felicity Jones), who has an unspecified cancer.As his mother's health continues to decline, Conor begins receiving visits from an anthropomorphic yew tree which Conor can see from his bedroom window in the church yard across a small valley. The tree appears to Conor as a monster (voiced and played by way of motion-capture animation by Oscar nominee Liam Neeson), but Conor is not afraid. The tree claims that Conor has summoned him and that the monster will continue to visit Conor until the purpose for which he was summoned is fulfilled. The monster will tell Conor three true stories from long ago and then Conor will have to tell the monster the story of Conor's recurring nightmare, which is supposed to reveal a truth that Conor is unable to admit.The monster's stories take the form of fables and appear on the screen as simple but beautiful animated sequences. They involve a prince and his stepmother vying for the throne of their kingdom, a parson who preaches against an old apothecary until he needs the apothecary's help and, lastly, an invisible man. The stories are all symbolic of people or circumstances in Conor's life, but he is initially unable to understand their relevance – or their endings, which are unexpected and disturbing to the young man. Yet, each story brings Conor closer to coming to terms with what is happening in his family – and to having to talk about his haunting nightmare and the truth it reveals, which Conor resists vehemently.""A Monster Calls"" is an original, tragic and beautiful film. MacDougall gives an especially strong and affecting performance in a year full of extraordinary performances by child and teen actors. The various forms of animation all have a raw beauty to them and are very effective at conveying tone and mood. Although the ways that the adults in Conor's life react to the trouble he gets into while expressing his inner turmoil are unrealistically muted, the script (by Patrick Ness, adapting his novel based on a story idea by the late author Siobhan Dowd) is creative and feels authentic. J. A. Bayona's direction is appropriately dark and sensitive. This film works well as entertainment – and as therapy for someone dealing with the illness of a loved one.

25,TheMovieDiorama,A Monster Calls to ensure the audience have no dry eyes.,10/10,1 January 2017,"An adaptation of the critically acclaimed novel, A Monster Calls is about a 12 year old boy who struggles to come to terms with his mother's battle with cancer. I remember reading the book a few years ago and was moved by the unique perspective of such a tragic yet relatable story. Having now seen the film adaptation, I can safely say that this is one of the best book-to-film adaptations I've seen and if this does not get nominated...heads will roll. Newcomer Lewis MacDougall takes on the role of Conor, quite a difficult character to portray but he does so perfectly. I had initial concerns especially as a newcomer but his debut performance solidifies that he will have a successful career in the future. He wasn't an annoying child actor, he personified the maturity of Conor exceptionally and when it came to the more emotionally driven scenes he was extraordinarily good. He is in the company of Felicity Jones (who I really really hopes gets nominated) and Sigourney Weaver in which the latter gives one of her best performances. The story is one we have seen many times in films, but what makes this more creative is the story is told through the perspective of Conor and the monster he imagines to help get him through this difficult time. Even the credits are told through his perspective as the characters are stated as their relationship to Conor (i.e. Mum, Dad etc.), I thought that was a nice touch. J.A. Bayona mixes the dark mature tones with the child-friendly shell that the marketing may have you suggest but do not be fooled. I can assure you, you will feel. You will get the feels. I consider myself emotionless and yet I grew slightly teary in many scenes, it's just so emotionally powerful without the film being manipulative and to me that is an extremely admirable trait to have. As the monster (voiced by the epic ness that is Liam Neeson) describes three tales to Conor, the film pulls the audience into a watercolour animation sequence which is absolutely beautiful to look at. The fact that Bayona decided to retain the watercolour and sketching style shows that he knows what he is doing, he is a confident visual director. Patrick Ness, who wrote the book, also wrote the script for the film which is why it is an extremely faithful adaptation. Perfect balance of smart wit and captivating drama. Overall, A Monster Calls is simply one of the best dramas I have ever seen. Tantalisingly powerful, heart achingly emotional and beautifully majestic. The best thing I can say, is that I want to see it again right away.Review at: http://www.themoviediorama.com",A Monster Calls,3416532
26,Horst_In_Translation,A truly fantastic ride,6/10,6 June 2017,"""A Monster Calls"" is a Spanish/American/British co-production from 2016 that results in an English-language movie and boy has this one been successful with the awards circuits. It runs for 105 minutes approximately and was directed by J.A. Bayona, thus the Spain reference. The screenplay writer is Patrick Ness and he is also the one who came up with the original novel here. Looking at the awards, the IMDb rating and the RT reception, you can certainly say that he did a good job overall. Lead actor Lewis MacDougall is probably not too famous (yet?), but Weaver, Jones and Neeson (all Oscar nominees) are of course household names by now. And they are all giving strong performances too. Weaver and Jones add a lot of heart to the story while Neeson gives one of the more memorable voice acting performance in recent history.This is the story of a teenager who not only has to deal with bullying at school, but also needs to come to terms with his mother's mortality. And he finds a strong companion not necessarily in easing his pain, but in directing it properly. The consequence is also that the moments when he says he wants it to be over and when they are at the mother's bed are really touching and got my eyes wet. Sadly, these moments alone are not enough to really appreciate everything before that. There are always minor flaws in terms of storytelling, nothing too serious, but enough to make a difference for the negative side in terms of the quantity. For example the third story was really really weak compared to stories one and especially two. The protagonist standing up to the bullies added nothing to the film in my opinion. And actually it also did not feel too authentic. And there are other flaws too, like the part with the dad is not really a worthy addition because it does not add anything in terms of character development other than perhaps showing the protagonist is far from alone, but Weaver (and Jones) provide that to a sufficient degree too.Nonetheless, the weaknesses in storytelling are somewhat made up by the strengths in performances, even if I did not like the lead actor as much as some of the others I guess. This is certainly one of the most depressing 2016/2017 films, probably not one of the best, but still fairly good. It could have needed some more cutting though, maybe should have stayed at 90-95 minutes max and it would have been a really strong film if they had left out the right (i.e. wrong) scenes. I still recommend it though, just not that enthusiastically.",A Monster Calls,3416532

There is something amazing about this movie, that it uses a character positioned as a monster, who turns out to be a savior of sorts. A friend, a protector and a voice of calm reason to someone whose life is in turmoil.This boys life is near turned upside down. School is a hell, the father is absent and the Grandmother is a distant somewhat disconnected person to him. His life lacks any real comfort and he knows no safe harbor but his mother. And he is losing her.What he needs is to feel safe enough to confront what is facing him. The ""Monster"" finally shows him how to summon the strength needed to do this. Funny, but in the end the tree is his keeper and friend.The acting is superb, by all. Liam's voice work is a defining role for him. One need only hear his voice to picture his figure behind the voice. That is true art.The real monster in this move? Just as in life, that would be cancer.I know this monster. I know its' face.

28,neil-476,Exquisitely painful,10/10,16 May 2018,"Conor is having a bad time. Bullied at school, suffering a recurrent nightmare, and trying to cope with his mother's progressive illness, he is visited at night by a monster tree-man from the yew tree in the local churchyard who tells him three stories, and expects the true story of Conor's nightmare in return.This film takes Conor's real-life problems - very real, and all centred around his mother's illness - and smashes them face-first into the fantasy figure of the tree monster and his stories, fearsome and compassionate at the same time. This may not sound terribly convincing, but it works extremely well.The story came from a writer who died of the cancer which inspired her story before she was able to write the book: the author who worked her idea into a (childrens) book has also written the screenplay, and the stories-within-the-story are animated in the style of the watercolour illustrations in the original book. And this is some of the most beautiful animation you will see anywhere. Coupled with the CGI tree-man, there are some exquisite visuals on show here, interwoven seamlessly with the rather shabbily picturesque locations.Felicity Jones is good as the stricken mother, Sigourney Weaver does a brilliant job as the unsympathetic grandmother rather gracelessly making plans to take care of Conor afterwards, while dealing with her daughter's imminent death, a death which Conor is having such difficulty facing. Liam Neeson as the voice of the monster is amazingly good, and Lewis McDougal as Conor is stunning.All of which contributes to the emotional impact of this film, which is brutal. There is no niceness about what happens here, but it is dealt with compassionately and kindly as well as painfully. I sat in the darkness weeping as Grandma and Conor finally find a way to meet each other in a car stopped at traffic lights, and also as the Monster finally rips the truth of Conor's nightmare out of him. And as for the photograph of Mum and her father...This film hurt like hell, and I loved it.",A Monster Calls,3416532
29,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Not easy to get into at first, but pays off by the end",9/10,1 November 2017,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Conor (Lewis MacDougall) is a young man who's having bad luck fall down on him like heavy rain (as it literally does in most of the film.) He's being bullied at school, and his mother (Felicity Jones) is dying from cancer, leaving him in the care of his strict grandmother (Sigourney Weaver.) Alone and confused in the world, one day he gets the surprise of his life when a giant tree (Liam Neeson) comes to life, and tells him about three tales he needs to hear, which will come to have a bearing on how events pan out in his life. As an emotional thunderstorm braces his life, Conor's friendship with the tree takes a turn that will set them on a forever course.The first thing that irks you about J.A. Bayona's unique tale is how misleading the title is. A monster is a description of a bad, evil thing, which the multi-twigged centre-point of this film is hardly. The title sounds like your standard, generic horror film that usually winds up in the straight to DVD isle today. Alas, A Monster Calls is anything but generic. The characters, the set-up, the delivery, are all profoundly unique, and develop a film that emerges as an entirely different experience to anything you may have seen before.Initially, it's all a bit disconcerting, and doesn't set the most concrete ground to form the basis of a story on. As a result, it doesn't hold your attention much to start with, and it doesn't help that the tone is so caked in misery. from the grey, drained surroundings, in the bleak area the film is set in, constantly doused in falling rain. But somehow, if you stick with it, it develops into a film all of its own, and stirs a deep emotional chord in your heart that pays off marvellously in the end.Performances wise, Neeson is perfectly suited as the voice and mirror image of the tree, his deep, gravelly voice embodying the nature and presence of his character wonderfully, but the real revelation is MacDougall as the young boy, seething with pain and anger at his predicament and those around him, who is forced to confront his demons by this other-worldly creature. It's a match made in Heaven, and makes this something as close to a must see as there can be. ****",A Monster Calls,3416532

31,MichaelNontonMulu,A beautifully created but sad & heart breaking story of a teenage boy,7/10,18 October 2016,"This movie was a drama film about a boy who had to face so many life challenges at a young age. As described by the Monster, Connor was too old to be called a child but to young to be called a man. It was a heartbreaking and touching movie with most of the scenes especially in the end were very sad. But the moral & message of the story was actually quite deep. The monster in this movie was not a scary monster and it was not supposed to be a film where people are being hunted by the monster or vice versa. However the special effect & the sound effect of the monster was very good. Liam Neeson's voice also added the element of warmth, strength and power.Meanwhile, the story itself was actually adapted from the novel by the same title written by Patrick Ness. The movie was supposed to play in US theaters this month but it was delayed till early 2017. So Indonesians are quite fortunate to have the opportunity to see this one before the US. Just take note that it is only playing in 21 Cineplex cinema chain.For me personally, the most memorable part of the movie was the 1st of the 3 stories told by the Monster. I think the similar feeling that Connor had in the end, had greater impact on my wife. Anyway, for those who love to see touching heart breaking drama with some fantasy & good but brief special effects, then this movie would be suitable for you. However for those who are looking for fantasy action movie, then you would not like to watch this. for my complete review, pls have a look at michaelnontonmulu.blogspot.co.id",A Monster Calls,3416532
32,deloudelouvain,Beautiful animations in a good but sad movie,8/10,16 July 2017,"A fantasy drama, not really the genre I would go for normally. But I have to admit I was impressed, positively impressed. It's a beautiful story, not a joyful movie but a sad movie. Nevertheless being a sad movie you get captivated by the story from the beginning till the end. The young Lewis MacDougall could not have done better playing his character. The whole cast was perfectly chosen for their respective characters. Even Liam Neeson that is just the narrating voice of The Monster was the perfect fit for that part. His narrating voice and tones are to me one of the better things about A Monster Calls. But also the animation during the told stories, they are just sublime to watch. It all brings the movie to a higher level. I will watch this movie again in the future, knowing well that even if I will be prepared this time I will still have sad moments.

33,Rob_Taylor,Yet another mis-advertised movie...,4/10,4 March 2017,"So, if you watch the trailer for this film, you might be forgiven for thinking that it is a fantasy romp suitable to take your children to see. The fantastic elements of the film are prioritised in the trailer and the addition of a stirring, epic theme might make you think it is all going to be good fun.But look again. The dialogue should tell you that there is something dark going on in this film but don't be tempted to think it is just an ""obstacle"" for the characters to overcome. It really is dark.What the film is, is a coming of age drama about a boy whose mother is dying of cancer and his struggle to come to terms with that. The fantastic elements are, much like Bridge to Terabithia, simply the way that the boy makes sense of the events over which he has no control.Unlike Terabithia, however, A Monster Calls has no light moments preceding the darker moments of the film. It is all darak. Dark, and dreary, and terribly depressing. The eventual catharsis the boy experiences at the end of the movie can in no way wash away the downward mood swing this feature will engender throughout its runtime.So be warned, despite the trailer, this is not a kid's movie in any way, shape, or form. If I'm honest, I'm not sure who would find this movie entertaining. At most, it might make you think a little but, if you've ever had any kind of childhood trauma you might consider giving it a miss. It really is that depressing.On the plus side, it is reasonably well acted, especially by newcomer Lewis MacDougall. Others, less so, and I have no idea what Sigourney Weaver was doing with her accent other than to say I've never heard anyone English talk like that.Visually, it is very striking, but that is really all that is going for it as a form of entertainment. The band Fallout Boy once wrote a song with the lyrics ""The best of us can find happiness in misery..."" This movie puts a lie to that assertion. There is no joy to be found is this movie, only despondency and sadness.Mostly, I think this just goes to show you should never trust a movie trailer to judge a film's content by. Another recent example of this was Mr. Holmes, which portrayed its subject matter as a light hearted romp as well. At least that one doesn't leave you feeling miserable by the end of it.In short, not a fun movie in any way and woefully misrepresented by its marketing media, which seemed intent on simply getting as many bums on seats in the auditorium as possible.SUMMARY: Horribly depressing look at life, and its end. Not for children, ever. Not really for adults, either. Well made, but dreary and terribly badly marketed. Avoid.",A Monster Calls,3416532
34,ferguson-6,bump in the night,8/10,28 December 2016,"Greetings again from the darkness. ""From ghoulies and ghosties/ And long-legged beasties/ And things that go bump in the night,/ Good Lord, deliver us"". It's an old Scottish poem that doesn't take into account what movies like Pete's Dragon, The Jungle Book, The BFG, and now this latest from director JA Bayona have intimated this year  not all those 'bumps' are necessarily evil.Lewis MacDougal delivers an incredibly nuanced performance displaying a wide array of emotions as ""a boy too young to be a man, and too old to be a child"". His beloved mother (the always terrific Felicity Jones) is bedridden with a terminal illness, and Conor faces relentless pressure for a kid: bullies at school, a dying mom, a strict grandmother, and some rough and vivid dreams/nightmares. As his clock flips to 12:07 am, he watches as a Groot-like giant sprouts from a nearby Yew tree. It's an intimidating and magnificent beast who, through the dulcet tones of Liam Neeson, informs Conor that he will tell the boy three stories  after which Conor must tell his own.The meaning behind the three stories (Prince/Queen, Apothecary/Parson, Invisible Man) is not immediately obvious to Conor, but the stories are animated through beautiful watercolors providing depth to the dreams and the lessons. This fascinating film is based on the novel by Patrick Ness who completed the idea of Siobhan Dowd after she passed away from the terminal illness that inspired the story.I made the mistake of assuming this was going to be a kid's movie in the style of another featuring the voice work of Mr. Neeson (as Aslan) - The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe (2005). Instead, it's a heavy drama, filled with emotions beyond what most kids experience. Conor is trying to come to grips with living with his stuffy grandmother (a solid Sigourney Weaver) while his mother slowly fades (but not without first introducing her son to the original misunderstood beast in King Kong), and already having a mostly absentee Dad (Toby Kebbell).As with most tearjerkers (and this certainly is that!), there will be those who describe it as manipulative and obvious, but it's likely most will find it to be a touching, well-written, superbly acted film with standout special effects utilized for the advancement of the story. Young Mr. MacDougal carries most of the movie and seamlessly bounds from anger to sadness to hopeful. Director Bayona proved in The Impossible and The Orphanage that he has an eye for kid actors, and when combined with the voice of Liam and the other fine actors it makes for a powerful experience  and a reminder that dealing with death is difficult for both kids and parents, and we all need a little help letting go (displayed literally here).**NOTE: sharp-eyed viewers will spot a photograph of Liam Neeson as Conor's grandfather on a shelf in the house.",A Monster Calls,3416532
35,Prismark10,A Monster Calls,5/10,6 April 2020,"A Monster Calls is an adaptation of a Young Adult novel from Patrick Ness.This moody and gloomy film is far from being a kids film that deals with impending loss of a loved one.Conor O'Malley (Lewis MacDougall) is a small teenaged boy in the north of England. He is bullied at school and his mother (Felicity Jones) is dying of cancer. Conor shares his mother's artistic flair.His father works in America and his grandmother (Sigourney Weaver) is getting ready to care for him. He finds her distant.One night when the clock strikes 12:07, a pagan tree monster (voiced by Liam Neeson) visits Connor and tells him a story with a twist. He makes subsequent visits at the same time with similar stories.The monster has not arrived to help heal his mother, more to help get over the boy's guilt about his mother's condition.The film is an uneven movie dealing with grief. The bullying storyline is inept. When you get so savagely beaten you will bleed and have bruises. The father randomly turning up and taking Conor to Blackpool was pointless. The film should had got another actor to voice the tree, I think Neeson is typecast with these kind of voice parts.The biggest fault is that Ness is an inexperienced screenwriter as he showed in his Doctor Who spin off Class. Despite some well displayed animation, it is lethargic and lacks drive.",A Monster Calls,3416532
36,siderite,The de facto sequel to Pan's Labyrinth,8/10,20 February 2017,"Released kind of at the same time with The BFG, it can be considered similar, as it explores the rich inner life of children wishing reality was different, but to me it was more like Pan's Labyrinth, in both dramatism and .. err... Spanishness.If there was something that didn't quite work here, it was the acting. The kid was OK, but all the other characters were played mechanically. The imaginative script was complimented by the good special effects, but in the end, their quality didn't help to further the story much. I would have preferred to feel more from the acting.Bottom line: be warned, this is a mom dying of cancer movie, but it was interesting and it felt refreshing.

37,brankovranjkovic,"A Monster Calls. A modern fairy tale, which is scary in places, so may not suitable for a very young audience",9/10,5 January 2017,"First film of 2017, starring Lewis MacDougall as Conner the boy, Felicity Jones as the mother, Sigourney Weaver as the very strict grandmother, Toby Kebbell as the absent father and Liam Neeson as the voice of the Tree Monster.Connor is a 12 year old, he needs to deal with several heavy emotional situations simultaneously. His mother is dying from cancer, he is being viciously bullied at school, his father lives in USA and has been absent for the majority of his life but makes a rare visit. The Tree Monster is originally a creation from his mum's imagination. Towards the end of the film we see an old artist's pad where she had previously sketched the Monster and other fairy tale scenes. The Monster visits Connor every night at precisely 12:07, the Monster wants to tell him three stories and hear one in return. The three stories are from his mum's imagination, represented by the fairy tale sketches she leaves. These stories help Connor deal with his feelings of anger, sadness and frustration. Lewis MacDougall was particularly impressive, a standout child performer. I was pretty much immediately and totally invested in the character. Lewis carries the film throughout. This film is a very emotional fantasy drama, and a real tear-jerker, especially towards the end where it deals with the death of a parent from a child's perspective and the leaving of a child from a parent's perspective. Highly recommended.",A Monster Calls,3416532
38,kathi-22236,"Incredibly moving, and I never say that about a movie",10/10,15 February 2021,"I'm still ugly crying as I write this, right after watching A Monster Calls. I was just looking for a movie to keep me company on Valentine's Day, and I love a good fantasy. And I pretty much just randomly selected this one. I haven't seen a movie of any genre with this much depth of emotion, at least for my personal experience. Perhaps, if you haven't experienced great grief, it won't resonate with you; but if you have, this movie provides an incredible vehicle for allowing you to let yourself feel your feelings and actually understand a lot of them in a way you might not have been able to before.The story is both simple and complicated. It draws you in. The performances are superb, from the always wonderful Sigourney Weaver to the marvelous child actor, Lewis MacDougall. Liam Neeson's tree monster is both terrifying and sympathetic. When the monster first started telling the stories, I was thinking, ""Oh, this is going to be a bit lame,"" but I was so wrong.I have never had a movie make me sob this much, yet feel so much relief and comfort from doing it.

Cast and a pretty good job of telling the story from the perspective of the boy and his struggle to deal with losing a mother. In addition the little boy had to deal with schoolhouse bullies and evented this monster to help him deal with some of the problems he was experiencing in life. Not really a movie for kids 10 and under I would say but it does teach a Is valuable. The movie was rather long and drawn out but still worth the watch. I recommend this film.

42,lee_eisenberg,a child's experience,8/10,5 July 2017,"""A Monster Calls"" reminded me of ""Pan's Labyrinth"", with the surreal atmosphere and story of a child's fantasies. The focus in this case is a boy whose mother has terminal cancer. He gets visited by the Monster, a yew tree that has a number of stories. But eventually it will come time for the boy to tell a story.The Monster is naturally an intense character. Don't get me wrong; he has a purpose, and lots of good things to say. But I would say that an equally intense character is the boy's grandmother. Stern and emotionally distant, she gives the boy as much incentive to imagine the Monster as does the school bully.It's an impressive movie. What I liked best was the Monster's stories (one focusing on a prince, another on an apothecary). But in the end, the movie is about letting go. And there are some fine performances. In the lead of course are Lewis MacDougall as the boy and Liam Neeson as the Monster, but strong support comes from Felicity Jones as the mother and Sigourney Weaver as the grandmother (Charlie Chaplin's daughter Geraldine also appears, having previously appeared in Bayona's 2007 movie ""The Orphanage""). I understand that Bayona is currently making the fifth movie in the ""Jurassic Park"" series.",A Monster Calls,3416532
43,SoumikBanerjee1996,Psychologically Emotional!,8/10,6 February 2017,"When I first watched the trailer of it, I totally thought it to be another film for ""Children Only""!But I was wrong, Damn Wrong!I will not give any spoilers here, for the sake of the viewers!So let's come straight to the Pros & Cons!PROS : #1 The story started a little bit slowly but gradually it picked up the speed! Love the moments of building up the whole scene!#2 Cinematography & VFX is awesome! Specially the stories that the ""Monster"" tells us will make you amaze!#3 Performances from all the actors were truly brilliant, Specially from Lewis MacDougall!! What a spectacular performance he's given! Even other adult characters fell into the shadow just because of him! He totally carries the film on his shoulders!#4 Felicity Jones as the mother is superb! Love the fantastic Mother-Son chemistry here! We could relate to their every emotions there! Joy, Sorrow, Anger, Everything!!#5 This film is sort of unique in it's own way! and why is that?cause this film shows us the ""Real Truth"" of our lives!Being presented in a child's story, it depicts the emotions thatgo through in our everyday life! It teaches us many things!In a beautiful way!CONS :- Actually there aren't many CONS here but I would really like to mention some things here that I personally did not like it about!#1 First of all Apart from Grandma, Mother's character I did not like the Dad's character! I don't know why, Toby Kebbell Acted well, with no complaints from me whatsoever! But I did not like the inclusion of the character! It could have been much more Effective & Strong!#2 I loved the 2nd half of the film so much that I would have really loved it even better if the first half was as good as the second one! The first half takes some amount of time to build up and bring pace to the story! So could have been much more emotionally triggering! Just like the rest of it!OVERALL :- A really brilliant film, did not expect so much greatness from it to be honest! You would be surprised to see how much maturity the story has here!It's NOT AT ALL For under 10 Kids! Not at All!It's more for the Teenagers! And for those Adults who love Strong Emotional content!",A Monster Calls,3416532
44,leonblackwood,A bit depressing! 6/10,6/10,19 August 2017,"Review: What a, surprisingly, deep movie! I was expecting an upbeat, fantasy movie but it turned out to be slightly depressing but interesting at the same time. Anyway, Lewis MacDougall plays a young kid called Conor, who lives with his mum, played by Felicity Jones, who is suffering with cancer. Whilst being bullied at school, his grandma, played by Sigourney Weaver, tells him that he has to live with her, but he just wants to stay with his mum, who has to go through severe cancer treatment because everything that the doctors have tried, hasn't seemed to work. Conor then see's a magical Yew tree, Monster, who promises to tell him 3 stories, only if Conor tells him the fourth, so everyday at 12:07, the tree appears, even when Conor moves to his grandma's. When his dad comes over from America, he tells his Conor that he is unable to live with him, so Conor is forced to stay with his grandma, against his wishes. After the tree tells him the final story, Conor tells the tree his final story, and he finds out that his mum also saw the magical tree, which saved his life, and made him face his inner demons. Its quite a magical story, which does have some touching moments, but it's quite slow and there wasn't enough scenes with Conor and the tree. With that aside, the tree did look amazing, and Liam Neeson's voice was perfect for the role. Felicity Jones and Sigourney Weaver also put in emotional performances, along with the young Lewis MacDougall, who was talking to a green screen most of the time, so he had the toughest role of them all. Although I found the film to be touching, you do have to be in the right frame of mind to watch it, because you are left feeling quite glum when it's over. It's still worth a watch, mainly because of the tree, but the director could have installed some lighter issues to lighten the mood. Watchable!Round-Up: This movie was directed by J.A. Bayona, who also brought you the Orphanage in 2007, and the Impossible in 2012. He also directed a couple of episodes of Penny Dreadful, so he is obviously coming from a dark place, hence the way he made this movie. I always like seeing kids being kids, so it was hard to see Conor having to handle adult issues at such a young age. On top of everything that was happening at home, his school life was also hard for the young lad, so he really didn't have anywhere to turn. That's why the tree really was Conor's saviour, and I personally think it was the saviour of the movie. I also think that a lot of people was expecting more from the film, because it didn't smash the box office, as expected, but I didn't hear many negative reports about it.Budget: $43million Worldwide Gross: $46.6millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their fantasy/dramas, starring Lewis MacDougall, Sigourney Weaver, Felicity Jones, Toby Kebbell and the voice of Liam Neeson. 6/10",A Monster Calls,3416532
45,paul_haakonsen,"Visually great, but lacking a proper storyline...",4/10,25 April 2017,"I wasn't particularly hyped up or excited about ""A Monster Calls"". Why? Well, because I didn't even know about it prior to seeing the poster on the wall at the local cinema. Then again, I am not actively a fan of anyone in the movie.But still, the movie poster looked good and I read up on the synopsis for the movie, which also did prove to sound promising. So I sat down and watched ""A Monster Calls"".First and foremost I must say that the CGI used in ""A Monster Calls"" was downright impressive. Lots of amazing detail and it was just a pure work of art to watch it come to life on the screen. So you might as well be prepared to be blown away by the visuals here.And with that said, I must flip the coin and state that the storyline told in ""A Monster Calls"" was awkwardly devoid of anything even remotely compelling or interesting, and that resulted in a less than mediocre movie experience, because the visuals could only do so much for the movie.They had also managed to put together a great ensemble of cast for the voice work for the various roles and characters in the movie. And I will be the first to admit that it was because of Sigourney Weaver and Liam Neeson that I jumped at the chance to watch ""A Monster Calls"".However, as the movie ended, I was not even mildly impressed with the movie experience as a whole. Sure, it had been a visual treat to look at and I was taken aback with the level of details in every scene. But the storyline just was too slow paced and didn't have much to offer to keep me interested.As such then ""A Monster Calls"" hardly impressed and it is not an animated movie that I will be returning to for watching a second time.",A Monster Calls,3416532
46,PyroSikTh,MacDougall is Phenomenal in this Beautifully Heartbreaking Movie,9/10,4 January 2017,"A Monster Calls follows the story of Connor, a child too old to be a kid, but too young to be a man, as he goes through probably the hardest time a child his age could go through. His mother is slowly dying of a terminal illness, and his father lives with his new family in America, leaving Connor to look after her. When his mother gets particularly bad, Connor has to stay with his strict, house-proud grandmother. To make matters worse, he endures particularly horrendous bullying at school, is haunted by a nightmare, and everyone treats him differently. He is overcome with anger and grief. That is until the tree in the cemetery behind his house comes to life and starts telling him paradoxical stories. Through these stories, Connor starts to unpack the hard truths of life and is better able to deal with what's going on around him.When it comes to what the movie wants to say, and the lessons that can be gleamed from it, there are many. Each of the stories that the monster offers Connor have their own parabolic messages, and they all act as smaller parts of a larger truth that Connor himself must accept. Fundamentally, A Monster Calls is about grief, it's about dealing with loss and the emotional baggage that comes with, be it anger, sorrow, or guilt.Much like Labyrinth I reviewed a few days ago, there's a few deeper meanings and subtle uses of metaphor and symbolism that helps to elevate the movie, particularly to keener eyes. The most obvious is the prevalence of clocks. There's a clock in almost every scene, showing the passage of time and how it's inescapable, but also the time on those clocks can often hold meaning themselves, most notably the time the monster appears, which proves to be a pivotal time in Connor's life later on.A Monster Calls would not have worked nearly as well without Lewis MacDougall as Connor. A relative newcomer (having only starred in Pan previously, which no-one watched), he shows a talent and maturity that often outshines the more experienced actors surrounding him. His ability to show the conflict bubble underneath the surface, and let it explode out and retreat back in all in a single scene is breathtaking. From his outbursts of anger to his teary-eyed great and sorrow is palpable. Felicity Jones doesn't get a whole lot to do other than look horrifically ill, but the scenes she shares with MacDougall early on are enough to warm your cockles. Sigourney Weaver isn't entirely convincing as an elder British lady, but stills manages to put on one of the best performances I've ever seen from her. One scene in particular, completely without dialogue, shows the strength she can inhabit as an actress, whistling through shock, anger, and devastation all in a single heartbeat. It's a scene that will forever remain with me purely thanks to her. Finally Toby Kebbell appears every now and then as Connor's father, and I'm still in disbelief that he hasn't properly hit the big time yet.Of course half of what attracted me to A Monster Calls in the first place was the visuals, and it doesn't disappoint. Most notable is the creation of the monster himself, recreated with such life- like detail through motion capture thanks to the combined efforts of Liam Neeson and Tom Holland. His presence is both frightening and comforting at the same time. He's a true behemoth, and his introduction is terrifying, an aspect that is never truly lost even at his most benevolent. The detail on him, from the scratchy bark to the creaking branches is astounding and immersive.Furthermore, he's not the only visual aspect that deserves praise, as two of his stories are told, somewhat in the vein of Hermione's telling of the Deathly Hallows, almost entirely in small animated interludes that are truly beautiful to behold. The first is all inks and watercolours, creating a somewhat typical fantasy world of charming princes and evil stepmother queens, but with a dark twist. The offset between darkness and colour aids the storytelling perfectly. The second is made with degrees of stop-motion (emulated or not, I can't tell) silhouettes of an industrial era conflict between a priest and a pagan apothecary, and again, it's simply beautiful to watch, with the animation aiding in the telling of the story itself, setting moods and emotions and visually portraying the story's setting.What a way to start my year. A Monster Calls is a near faultless movie, with beautiful animation, impressive performances, and a surprisingly profound story that'll tug on your heartstrings as much as it'll have you thinking and dissecting the subtle symbolism throughout (although it does wear most of what it wants to say on it's sleeve). If I had one criticism, it's that it's unrelenting in it's treatment of sorrow and grief. This is an emotionally dark movie, and it does little to lighten the mood. By the time we reach the inevitable and unsurprising conclusion, I felt emotionally drained and crushed and just wanted it to end (which in retrospect is actually the most fitting achievement of this movie). I give A Monster Calls a solid 9/10, and would absolutely recommend it. It's probably too much for those going through loss, and too frightening for younger viewers, but everyone else just needs to make sure they bring plenty of tissues.",A Monster Calls,3416532
47,david-meldrum,"Beautiful, moving and deeply profound.",9/10,28 July 2018,"What a beautiful, haunting and profound film. It's about a boy whose mother is dying (his mother is separated from his father, who now lives abroad). The boy is visited at night by a monster in the form a of a large tree growing within sight of his house, who on each visit tells him one of three stories; he says on the final visit the boy must tell him a story which must be true. It's as simple as that - yet utterly beautiful and moving. Each of the stories is told as wonderfully stylised piece of animation (the rest of the film is live action); the rest of the action narrates the relationships between the boy, his mother, his father and grandmother, as well as the boy's problems at school. It made me think of so much - the effect of loss and trauma on a young life, and how much my precious foster children have lost in so little time, and the creative steps they have to take to cope the loss. It made me think of my own losses, and how I live with them, deal with them and create a life that tries to encompass them and somehow grow through them. And it made me think of my own failings as a son and a father. It's one of the most moving films I've seen in years, directed with great power and economy, performed with lovely understatement that is allowed to cut loose at crucial moments. Highly recommended.",A Monster Calls,3416532
48,Giacomo_De_Bello,6.5/10,6/10,13 October 2016,"Young boy Conors's (Lewis MacDougall) mother (Felicity Jones) is ill from cancer and gravely so, she is terminal. Having difficulty dealing with this horrible situation Conor is always visited by a tree monster (voiced by Liam Neeson) at 12:07. On one occasion the monster comes and tells him he is going to narrate him three stories and once he is done Conor will have to tell a fourth one and said story will have to be 'the truth'.What a premise right? If this doesn't get you excited immediately I would question one's film fandom, especially considering the talent involved all around from actors to director to composers to source material. Add to that the buzz that came out from TIFF and you can imagine the excitement I had in managing to see this very early on.With deep sadness in me I have to calls to spades and say that ""A Monster Calls"" was a disappointment. Whilst still being an above average effort in filmmaking and having some incredibly inspired work behind it, the final product, the sum of it all, is a partially pleasing or cathartic experience with tonal shifts and a little messy directing.What is the film's core problem but also its natural fascination is its fantasy element. It is brought to life on a sole visual and sound level incredibly well. I mean the CGI here is flawless, MacDougall's performance contributes to giving an enormous weight to this creature whose artistic value is probably close to what a Guillermo del Toro would do. Add to that the voice of Liam freaking Neeson going really low on his tones with some beautiful sound enchantments, and you have your unforgettable monster.Character wise too, the monster manages to emerge from the screen and really be a three-dimensional presence in the film that you just treat as another character in the narrative. He also has something to say as it is clear by the film and all of this mystery surrounding him plus the various traits and shadows he is given, making him a kind and calm presence at times, gives the monster an aura that was fascinating and hard not to be compelled by.The movie of course, given the themes, has its deeply emotional moments that tug on your heart-strings and whilst we will talk later about how some of these moments fall completely fat, there is an inherent emotion established, especially between the monster and the boy, which makes for some really touching scenes enhanced by Fernando Velasquez's beautiful score that repeatedly came in and gave me chills. If there is one thing the film nails it's the music, which actually nails down the tone of the whole story, contrary to the film itself, which brings me to the problems.The movie does not manage to balance its fantasy element easily and this makes for very heavy tonal shifts and problematic storytelling and directing. Firstly, the monster's mythology is never, ever clear to the audience. You see there is a difference between explaining everything (which should never be done) and rationalizing something, meaning that you establish some rules for your particular world, you stick to those few rules in order to make the audience understand and, in fact, rationalize the glorious fantasy craziness that's going on on screen. Well, ""A Monster Calls"" unfortunately doesn't do that. You never understand it the monster is imaginary or a dream, you don't understand how it is supposed to come in, you just cannot manage to get a grip in how it interacts with the boy and consequentially with the world. It is breaking established limits left, right and center. Worst of all is the telling how the three stories. Don't get me wrong the movie blends animation beautifully and intelligently, the problem is that other than the first story the others aren't delivered to you completely, it creates a annoyingly chaotic story-line which in the end suffers from this: the resolution doesn't hit hard because you get to only partially understand and enjoy the fantastic element of the film.Moreover, when in the real world entirely, the film is plainly flat and uninteresting. I do not know what direction Bayona was giving Sigourney Weaver, but it made for what is possibly her worst performance. Outside of the dream world, ""A Monster Calls"" becomes clichéd, unemotional and almost boring. The directing switches and becomes really, really flat, with aimless shots and terribly disjointed storytelling. Toby Kebbell could have been easily cut out of the film as he plays a character that brings exactly zero change to the picture. Felicity Jones' brilliant talents are unfortunately relegated to a one note performance that reaches a very high point at times in fact of acting, but impact on emotion and story was sadly bland as there was just nothing to grasp in the family drama that both written and directed chaotically and unconvincingly.""A Monster Calls"" underwhelmed me and I could not be sadder it did, I wanted to love this film with all my heart, be captured in its world and experience this deeply thematic and cathartic tale: I only got a glimpse of that and what a glorious glimpse did I get, but overall it seems that we'll have to wait some more time before getting another experience like ""Pan's Labyrinth"".",A Monster Calls,3416532

50,jboothmillard,A Monster Calls,6/10,12 January 2017,"I saw the trailer for this film, based on the popular children's novel, a month or two before its release, and I saw it reviewed on TV, it looked like something I may enjoy, directed by J.A. Bayona (The Orphanage, The Impossible). Basically 12-year-old Conor O'Malley (Lewis MacDougall) is struggling with life, his mother (Felicity Jones) has terminal cancer, his grandmother (Sigourney Weaver) is being strict, his estranged father (Toby Kebbell) has returned in an attempt to reconnect, and he is being severely bullied at his local school by Harry (James Melville). One night, seven minutes after midnight, Conor encounters a giant tree-like Monster (Liam Neeson), it tells the boy he will tell him three true stories, after which Conor must tell him his own story, the truth behind the nightmare he has had many times. The Monster continues to meet Conor, almost always at 12:07 AM or PM, to tell these stories, all of which involve the Monster being summoned, Conor reluctantly allows him to tell them, but sees no point or reason for him doing so, he does not see how it helps him. The first story: an old kind losing his family and marrying a beautiful woman, he dies and she becomes queen, the prince refuses to marry her and runs away to marry a farm girl, she is murdered, the prince believes the queen did it and is a witch, the Monster awakes and joins the mob, she was indeed a witch, but the prince was evil, the Monster saved the queen. The second story: an apothecary (medical pharmacist) has his business go down when a local parson intervenes, the parson's own two daughters become sick and begs the apothecary to help, he says he will allow the apothecary access to the yew tree and its healing ingredients and to revoke his beliefs if his daughters will be saved, but the apothecary refuses, the Monster punished the parson for his actions, as he was willing to sacrifice his beliefs, the apothecary stayed with his beliefs to work and to heal. The third story, a short one: there was a man who was invisible as no one ever saw him, tired of this he summoned the Monster to make people take notice of him, the people looked, but they saw something wretched. Conor will not accept that his mother cannot be saved, ultimately he is forced to face up to his nightmare, he does not want his mother to die, but he must learn that it is inevitable and something he must accept. Conor tells the fourth and final story, the truth about his nightmare: his mother is pulled to the edge of a cliff when the ground collapses, Conor grabs his mother's hand to save her from the pit below, his grip fails and his mother falls, but the Monster forces him to confess that he did this on purpose, he could have held on longer, but he let go to end his pain of holding on. In the end, with the Monster by his side, Conor returns to reality, comforts his mother in her final moments, she dies at seven minutes past midnight, he returns home with his grandmother and gets his own room, where he finds his mother's old sketchbook, in which she drew pictures of the characters from the stories, and of herself as a child with the Monster. Also starring Geraldine Chaplin as The Head Teacher, Jennifer Lim as Miss Kwan, Ben Moor as Mr. Clark and Oliver Steer as Sully. MacDougall gives a compelling performance as the boy forced to face up to the inevitable, Weaver does her best with the English accent but is certainly good at being cold, Jones is suitably sympathetic with her ailment, and Neeson is a great choice as the dark yew tree come to life who is supportive. I found out bits and pieces of what the story involved, and may have had a predictable spoiler alert given away slightly, but it didn't mean I wasn't swept away, the plot is clever, the stories told are interesting, the themes of grief and acceptance work very well, and the special effects and animation techniques are fantastic, it is a sad story but worthwhile, an emotional and watchable dark fantasy drama. Good!",A Monster Calls,3416532
51,themovieparadise,A Beautifully Written and Directed Film With a Powerful Message,9/10,1 November 2016,"The performances are top notch. Felicity Jones steals the movie with a very restrained and emotional performance, one that could earn her a Best Supporting Actress nomination. Lewis MacDougall was also excellent. I wouldn't put him on the level of say Jacob Tremblay in Room, but he effectively carried the film and invited us into this world. Sigourney Weaver, Toby Kebbell and Liam Neeson were also really good in their supporting roles. But the stand-out of the film is the writing and directing. Patrick Ness wrote the screenplay based off of his own book, and I think he's looking at an Oscar nomination. It was so well crafted and organized. There was a Q&A with him after the screening I attended, and he was very witty, but also insightful on his process of writing. I believe he has a nice career ahead of him in the industry. I already touched on the directing before, but Bayona proves himself to be one hell of a visual storyteller. I can't wait to see what he does with Jurassic World 2...

52,CANpatbuck3664,"Deeply Emotional Yet Brutally Honest, A Monster Calls is an Amazing Fable",9/10,28 March 2017,"*Minor Spoilers Ahead* Conor (Lewis MacDougall) is dealing with an impossibly difficult situation at such a young age. His mother (Felicity Jones) is dying of an unspecified disease. What makes this worse is that she's not only Conor's mother, she's his only friend. He's getting bullied at school for being the quiet and withdrawn kid and his Grandma (Sigourney Weaver) is cold and unable to relate to Conor effectively. His dad (Toby Kebbell) has divorced his mom and remarried so he's not there either. One night when Conor has stayed up late drawing, a Monster (Liam Neeson) made up from a large tree in the churchyard uproots and snatches Conor from his home. He doesn't wish to hurt Conor but tells him that his purpose is to re-visit him and tell him 3 stories. Conor refuses and initially tries to get rid of the Monster but after being possibly eaten by the Monster, he wakes up a little shaken but interested in seeing what happens next.This is a pretty dark story and although this was one of the best movies from 2016, I can see why it flopped at the box office. How do you sell this movie to the general audience? Unlike most movies geared towards families, this movie does not gloss over the darker side of these issues. In fact, it pulls back the curtain and throws it in your face. That's not a bad thing necessarily; most movies talk down to kids and don't trust them to understand. I admire that about this movie while cautioning people that this might be too much for little children to deal with. It might also be impossible to get through this movie without having an emotional breakdown. But I do feel that this movie does that honestly at least, most tearjerkers manipulate you to feel. The sadness that comes from watching this movie is from the subject matter not them constantly twisting the narrative to make things sappy. I'll admit I cried at the end but there were several different points in the movie I was tearing up.Another thing that movies for families do is fit characters into nice consistent forms to make things easier to process. A Monster Calls does something that is so rare in any type of movie; they give you well-drawn yet sympathetic characters which can't be described as completely good or bad. The first story the Monster tells is about just that lesson, that people aren't generally heroes or villains, they lie somewhere in the middle. His grandma isn't bad because she's cold, they just have so little in common and his dad isn't a jerk because he left, he just got married too young and it didn't work. The maturity of this movie is kind of astounding from that perspective.This movie is set in the real world and those scenes are interesting but they're not necessarily remarkable from a visual standpoint. The Monster looks really impressive, he's well rendered and they make him intimidating. They also tweak the design enough that he's different from other monsters like the Ents from Lord of the Rings. When the Monster begins to tell his stories though, the movie jumps into hyper-drive visually. Those animated scenes are gorgeous and they brought something different to the movie. I didn't want to miss a minute of them and they were really something else.The cast of the movie is pretty small but they all do excellent work. Lewis MacDougall hits all the right notes. He's got to sell all of this heavy material and he's up to the challenge. Felicity Jones works just as well, she's really doing a good job picking projects and she has to throw herself into this with the dramatic physical changes her character has to go through. Sigourney Weaver does a decent job, her accent is a little off but she's serviceable. Toby Kebbell doesn't get enough credit as an actor, this kind of movie showcases what he can do when he's not caught up in a failing franchise or a movie that's really special effects heavy. Liam Neeson was a good choice for the Monster, he's good at voice over work and his voice is a nice mix between intimidating and comforting.With all the hype this movie got, I expected to like it going in but I wasn't prepared for how touching and how nuanced A Monster Calls was. Sure, this movie makes you face some uncomfortable things but it should be praised for that instead of criticized for. This easily one of the best movies I saw from last year. It might not be 100% fun to watch but if you don't mind seeing some really dramatic material, I can't imagine anyone being disappointed by this movie. Go see this movie, and bring a box of Kleenex.",A Monster Calls,3416532
53,blanbrn,"A fairy tale film of imagination, hope, fear, anger, and truth.",8/10,14 January 2017,"All of us remember as a little kid the nightmares and terrified fears we had of the night dark and going to bed as a kid thinking about monsters. Well these themes are present with this picture ""A Monster Calls"" plus it's combined and blended with imagination, anger and fear and it shows how a fairy tale can compare and contrast with reality and the truth. The movie stars Lewis MacDougall as Conor a young little timid shy boy who's bullied and picked on at school plus he's from a broken home and to make matters worse his mom(Felicity Jones)is dying from terminal cancer and to go along with that his only support is that of his tough and cold distant grandmother(the still elegant and attractive sexy Sigourney Weaver). So what now well enter the escape and nightmare drama of a tree monster(the voice of the great Liam Neeson)outside his bedroom window who appears every night at 12:07 AM to tell tales the tree will tell a trio, and these stories are wild and wicked with witches, kings, princess, castles, and death all fables of moral lessons(a mix of ""The Wizard of Oz"", and ""Game of Thornes""). With the deal being for Conor to tell the 4th and final one and it must be something of the truth. It seems as if these stories from the tree monster never wrap and Conor sees them as a take that life is never happy and he feels that as a comparison to his mom's terminal cancer. Overall this film shows how life and grief can be faced thru the form of a fairy tale showing that emotions all can be tied up in forms of imagination, fear, and anger which all lead to the truth.",A Monster Calls,3416532

The visitations coincide with him being bullied at school and his strained relationship with his mother and grandmother.The characters, effects, production and story are all great!
You really get sucked into the life of the main character and there are quite a few anxious scenes where he is trying to come to terms his life.The monster dispenses some short stories in cartoon format which helps break up the relatively bleak and slow real action.I didn't find there to be many surprises but although I could see what was coming up ahead when the movie got there I was still gripped.This is an excellent movie, however, I don't think it is a spoiler to say that this film is not a barrel of laughs and it is quite slow.Watch this on a big TV with the sound turned up to get the most of the monster scenes.",A Monster Calls,3416532
55,paulclaassen,An all-round perfect film!!,10/10,20 August 2018,"Director J.A Bayona brought us 'The Orphanage', which is one of my favorite Spanish films. He then brought us 'The Impossible', which is one of my favorite films. And now 'A Monster Calls'. Oh my goodness, I hardly have words to describe how absolutely amazing this film was!!Apart from the impressive visuals, the film had a really great story. This was an interesting blend of heart wrenching drama and over-the-top amazing visual effects, and both were equally awesome. Due to the nature of its theme and the way the fantasy elements are presented, it all makes perfect sense, so the film will appeal to an audience who does not like fantasy films, as well. The acting is fantastic, especially from Lewis MacDougall, who plays the young boy. The giant tree together with Liam Neeson voicing it at times made me feel I was watching Optimus Prime from The Transformers, only here the character - or monster if you like - was a visual manifestation of the boy's over-active imagination as well as fighting his inner demons. The film was just perfect on every level, with an incredible message that will make you shed a tear or two. It tugs at the heartstrings with perfect friction. This was STUNNING!",A Monster Calls,3416532
56,bkrauser-81-311064,Lo and Behold and Original Film,9/10,5 January 2017,"Somewhere in between this film's vibrant colors, its collage of fluttering paint and its exquisite, rustic setting, a thought crossed my mind. Well two in fact, but more on that later. The disarmingly simple tale of a boy who conjures a monster to solve his problems is the kind that feels familiar. Yet with a surprising amount of maturity coupled with a frank exploration of grief, anguish and anger, A Monster Calls is unlike anything you have seen before. Watching A Monster Calls is like discovering a new chemical compound or mixing colors to make a startling new hue. That's right, for the first time in a long time, I feel like I've watched something new.The monster has been conjured by a nearby ewe tree, which is rooted in a cemetery a bit too close to the young Conor's (MacDougall) home. He frequently has nightmares, exacerbated by the fact that his mother has been suffering from cancer for quite some time. At 12:07 the monster, a lumbering assemblage of branches and roots, stops in to tell three stories. ""The fourth you must tell and you must speak the truth,"" the monster says. Yet with Conor's intermittent struggles with his oppressive grandmother, his absent father and the bullies in school, the monsters stories sound more to him like elaborate riddles than anything that might help ease his pain.The story itself has a fable-like quality that soothes the soul with lessons that, to this day remain frightfully undervalued. When not interweaving artful displays of special-effects, the film beautifully and honestly brings its characters to life – warts and all. Lewis MacDougall's instincts are absolutely at one with the story – he finds the perfect moments to reveal Conor's inner-life and seems to have internalized what his mother says about what makes his drawings more real; ""It's all in the eyes."" Felicity Jones, Sigourney Weaver, Toby Kebbell also all find their footing like singers naturally adjusted and practiced for their harmonies. While Jones recoils, Weaver propels; when Jones beams, Kebbell simpers. What we get at the end, is a symphony of feeling. One in which director J.A. Bayona is its stalwart conductor.And as a conductor, Bayona uses a wide range of visual cues and storytelling techniques to his advantage, to set the appropriate tone. When the monster leers at the paralyzed boy, branches crack and knot around the mis en scene in glorious texture. When the monster recalls tales of long ago, the screen explodes in scenes of animated watercolor. And lest you think things are only interesting when the monster calls, the set design is so rich with story enhancing detail that not a frame of this film loses impetus.Which brings me to my second, not so gracious thought; with a movie so honest, I honestly wonder who this movie is for. Its messages are so clearly displayed and its themes are so outwardly depressing that I fear audiences would run the other way before taking a chance on it. In addition, the film wraps things up much like a fable, going so far as to announce the moral of the story, which leads me to believe this film's prime demographic is children. Show me a parent with enough faith in their child to bring them to A Monster Calls and the popcorn is on me. As the monster himself said, ""People would rather live with a comforting lie than the truth, knowing full well they need the truth to tell the lie."" I doubt many will see A Monster Calls, despite its pedigree, despite its special-effects and despite its new and refreshing story. This is a movie that will reach deeper than you're used to, ask more of you than you're used to and give you the feels way, way more than you're used to. Some may find that notion too hard and shy away. I for one found this film and its endgame positively vital.",A Monster Calls,3416532
57,krifranc,A beautiful modern tale suffering from focus issues,7/10,26 September 2016,"The trailer for this movie was perfect, a real tearjerker focusing on exactly what the synopsis says: a little boy coming to terms with his mother's terminal illness with the help of his imagination. As someone who just lost his mother to cancer I was sobbing while watching the trailer and put this movie on my ""must-see"" -list. Unfortunately, the movie left me a bit cold.First the good parts. The relationship between the boy (Connor) and the monster works very well and the animations that go along with the monster's stories are absolutely gorgeous. I'm usually quite sceptical about combining different visual elements because it rarely works but here the tone and amount is just perfect. Another aspect of the film that works is the chemistry between the dying mother and her son. Oddly enough, this is the movie's biggest flaw since the mother has such a small part in the storyline.The first half of the movie strikes as unfocused, as if the director didn't know what he wanted to say. Quite often movies based on novels suffer from lack of focus because the director was unable to cut away portions from the source material. That is also the case with A Monster Calls. The heart of the story, the mother, is pushed aside in the very first minutes and we are introduced to a number of characters that add nothing to the story. More screen time is given to school bullies than to the mother which seems very odd. Apparently the director couldn't help himself and just had to dwell in bullying. A pattern which seems to be a norm in children's movies. Then we are introduced to the father, a character completely irrelevant to the story. His only purpose is to show that Connor comes from a broken family. I haven't read the novel the film is based on, so I can not say what his purpose was supposed to be. Perhaps his role was to showcase how important the mother was for the boy, since she's the only parent he's got. None of that comes through in the film, though. The father walks in and out, amounting to nothing.Then there's the grandmother who is introduced as an uptight caricature with too many minutes wasted on stressing her strictness. This is a real shame since the character also provides the most heartfelt moments in scenes establishing the shared grief she and Connor both feel. Something really amazing could've been accomplished with this pairing without the needless ""evil grandmother"" tropes. A real missed opportunity, I feel.Once the film has established just how hard a life Connor has, the focus goes back to where it should have always been: the mother and Connor's acceptance of her state of health. This is clearly the strong point of the story and the ending is executed beautifully. The emotional impact of the last half an hour or so also reminds the viewers of how impactful the entire film could've been had the father been reduced to a side mention and the minutes dedicated for school bullies cut in half in order to raise the profile of the mother. By doing so, A Monster Calls could've accomplished something groundbreaking by talking about cancer to children, many of whom will unfortunately be affected by it. This message, however, gets lost with the director juggling with too many elements.",A Monster Calls,3416532
58,Leofwine_draca,Hugely predictable,4/10,5 January 2018,"A MONSTER CALLS is another film centred around the folklore figure of the 'tree man' already thoroughly explored in everything from GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY to LORD OF THE RINGS and THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA. This time around he's a friendly creature who visits a mixed-up young boy to tell him stories in the dead of night. It turns out the kid's mother is dying of cancer, so the tree man is there to help him cope and grieve. Yeah, it's a rather cynical film that goes for the obvious approach throughout, but merely comes across as depressing. The actors fail to really get into their roles and a miscast Sigourney Weaver and her off-putting British accent don't help, although Toby Kebbell comes across well as always. The tree man scenes go overboard on the CGI and Liam Neeson merely reprises his Aslan role with a voice full of gravity. I found the whole thing hugely predictable, copying the likes of THE BFG somewhat shamelessly, and imparting a message that would take 10 minutes tops to film.",A Monster Calls,3416532
59,jon.h.ochiai,The Simplest Truth Will Set You Free,10/10,10 January 2017,"""A Monster Calls"" surrenders to our truths. When we do so, we set ourselves free. Liam Neeson as the Monster tells Lewis MacDougall's young Conor, ""Speak the simplest truth."" Hold on tight to those you love, while letting go. MacDougall and Neeson are amazing grace in Director J.A. Bayona's ""A Monster Calls"". ""A Monster Calls"" is about the serenity of acceptance. At a telling point in the story, Conor confesses to the Monster, ""I'm afraid."" He says, ""You should be"" It is all right to be afraid. It is all right to just be. That is the beauty of ""A Monster Calls"". In the opening scene Conor awakes from a recurrent nightmare as he loses grasp of his Mum's hands and she falls into the dark abyss. Set in England, 12 year-old Conor (MacDougall) selflessly cares for himself and his Mum (Felicity Jones), who seems to suffer from terminal cancer. He is terrified of what's next. He endures physical and verbal abuses from school bully Harry (a good James Melville). Conor's only escape derives from his drawings and watercolor paintings. One night, a behemoth Monster (voiced by Neeson) arises from the yew tree on the hill. The Monster will tell Conor three stories. Then Conor must tell the fourth story— his own truth. Patrick Ness wrote the screenplay based on his novel. Renowned children's author Siobhan Dowd originated the idea that inspired his novel. Bayona and Ness miraculously weave their story with gorgeous tapestries of animation, watercolor, and live action. The Monster narrates the story of: ""A boy too old to be a kid. Too young to be a man."" MacDougall breaks our hearts as Conor, a boy who has lost his smile. The Monster is the austere rooted sinuous beast towering over Conor. Neeson voices him with fierce benevolence and ruthless compassion. He tells Conor that there are no good guys; there are no bad guys. Maybe we are all somewhere between. Neeson and MacDougall's profound partnership in ""A Monster Calls"" poignantly resonates. Felicity Jones as Conor's Mom Lizzy appears gaunt and frail, but she embodies her bold spirit. Lizzy's last recourse is an experimental treatment at the hospital. Grandma (seemingly rigid Sigourney Weaver) must care for Conor at her home. He would rather not. His Dad (compassionate Toby Kebbell), who lives in Los Angeles with his new family, visits Conor and his Mum. There is a singular smile when Conor sees him. The reason of his visit is direr. He tells Conor that he needs to be brave. School bullies constantly plague Conor. Now what does the Monster want of him? And what is Conor's own story? Director Bayona creates the eloquently stunning imagery of the Monster's stories. Neeson's voice punctuates the gravitas and paradox of the tales. The movie is a visual masterpiece. The heart of the story comes from the powerful performances. Felicity Jones as Mum is unconditional love. She tells Conor, ""I wish I could give you a 100 years."" I was in tears, and often throughout the movie. Kebbell is valiant as Conor's estranged Dad, vulnerable and doing his very best. Sigourney Weaver is a surprise. Her Grandma is not what she seems. Her humanity touches. MacDougall and Neeson are amazing and inspired. MacDougall evokes this radiant soul in sadness, pain, and anger. When he hugs his Mum— you know what is in his heart. Neeson voices the Monster as both ominous and gently compassionate. He tells Conor that he'll be with him, and the world is safe. Everything will be all right. Bayona beautifully ties together his story. In the end everything makes sense, as if it were our own truth as well. ""A Monster Calls"" will make you cry and smile from your soul. It is an awesome movie. It may make you think about your own truth. ""A Monster Calls"" is about your simplest truth setting you free.",A Monster Calls,3416532
60,RLTerry1,"Bring your tissues for this ""Terms of Endearment"" for a new generation",9/10,15 December 2016,"Focus Features' ""A Monster Calls"" directed by J.A. Bayona is nothing short of a ""Terms of Endearment,"" in theme anyway, for a new generation. You are certain to laugh and cry your way through the film. Based upon the novel, by the same name, written by Patrick Ness and illustrated by Jim Kay and conceptualized Siobhan Dowd, Bayona's adaptation of the novel plays out to be a deep, rich, story that will touch the hearts and minds of each and everyone in the audience. For anyone going through the stages of grief, this film will especially ring true and perhaps bring about comfort. Although the protagonist Connor, played by Lewis MacDougal, is twelve years old, this dark melodrama with a plot revolving around terminal illness, is not typically something that will appeal to kids of Connor's age. Despite the fantasy elements and the young protagonist, A Monster Calls is more suited for older teens and adults; however, by the same token, the movie isn't entirely going to appeal initially to adults since the protagonist is quite young. I screened the movie last night in an auditorium filled with patrons of all ages and there was not one dry eye in the audience. Looking at the film from the outside and analyzing the plot and cast, it would appear that it may not attract droves of people because of the Gothic fantasy film, typically aimed at kids and young teens, with content and theming best suited for older audiences; however, the film truly transcends age barriers and stereotypes to touch those who are young or young at heart.This is certainly a year for fantastic monsters and fantasy, isn't it? However, A Monster Calls is definitely not your typical fantasy. It deals with deep emotions, dark themes, and material usually better suited for adults. Why then choose such a young protagonist? Perhaps the author Patrick Ness wanted to reach those kids who are going through tough times and who are dealing with situation that most kids won't face until they are much older. Some kids are just forced to grow up more quickly than other. It's important that cinema and literature not forget them because words on pages or moving pictures may be the only source of comfort, escape, or allegory. Director J.A. Bayona appears to have successfully translated the novel to screen--from what I know. Interesting that the movie opens with the narrator describing Connor as being too old to be a kid but to young to be an adult. By extension, that is precisely where this movie fits in. It's too ""old"" to be a kid's movie but too ""young"" to be an adult movie. And that's okay. Growing up is hard, and when faced with a family member or close friend with a terminal illness, life is exponentially more difficult emotionally and even psychically. Unconventional as it may seem, this film is powerful and transcends the age spectrum to provide a strong emotional journey that audiences can appreciate and from which people may receive comfort. From the opening credits alone, I was confident that this was going to be a visually stunning movie. The water color animation and brushstrokes are reminiscent of the story of the three brothers in Harry Potter. Absolutely beautiful. Much in the same way Kubo and the Two Strings was an innovative animated film, A Monster Calls also contains unconventional and innovative methods of telling its story. Similar to how the animated story of the three brothers in Harry Potter was integrated into the diegesis of a live action movie, so it is with this film. The more I thought about the technical and emotional elements of A Monster Calls, it is clear that it's truly a dynamic means of cinematic art. Dynamic in that there are three different types of storytelling methods used diegetically each highlighting a different form of art: (1) motion pictures (2) visual art (3) oral storytelling. It's been said that the novel is an extension of oral storytelling, the play an extension of the novel, and motion pictures an extension of the play. At the root of all those methods of communicating through art is the very concept of storytelling. And A Monster Calls has the art of storytelling in spades. The cinematic storytelling elements of direction, cinematography, editing, and score are all equally beautiful.Structurally, A Monster Calls is an intimate story reinforced and surrounded by artistic German expressionism calling attention to its own artifice. From the exterior shots to interior rooms, the various sets appear to be meticulously constructed on a stage and the wardrobe much like perfect costumes. The art tells the story effectively with little exposition required. Fernando Velazquez' score is so incredibly moving that you may find yourself listening to the score as it too truly assist in the overarching means of telling this story. The design of the monster is brilliant and ominous all at the same time. Almost animatronic in nature, the tree plays out like there is a puppeteer on the inside articulating the movements. The monster feels just as much like an actor as the actors playing the human characters. Liam Neeson was a perfect choice to cast as the tree's voice. His deep bass is comforting, warm, and wise-sounding. But just who is the tree (in the story)? Although we are never told whose spirit inhabits the tree that has seen thousands of years go by, there are a couple of hints as to who it might be if you pay close enough attention to subtleties in the film. At the end of the day, whether it's the spirit of someone or the personified life of the tree itself, it is of little consequence to the movie. Still, its definitely fun and interesting to talk about as my friend and I did after the film.",A Monster Calls,3416532
61,Hellmant,"The type of film I probably really would have enjoyed as a kid, but it is slow-building.",8/10,12 January 2017,"'A MONSTER CALLS': Four Stars (Out of Five)A fantasy drama about a young boy that's trying to cope with his mother's terminal illness, by imagining a tree monster that continues to visit him and tell him stories. It was directed by J.A. Bayona (who also helmed the 2007 supernatural horror flick 'THE ORPHANAGE', and the 2012 disaster flick 'THE IMPOSSIBLE'), and it was scripted by first time screenwriter Patrick Ness (it's also based on his 2011 children's novel, of the same name). The movie stars Lewis MacDougall, Felicity Jones (of 'ROGUE ONE' fame), Sigourney Weaver, Toby Kebbell and the voice of Liam Neeson. The film received mostly rave reviews from critics, and it's also been nominated for multiple respectable awards. I found it to be a very slow-building, but emotionally powerful coming-of-age tale. Conor O'Malley (MacDougall) is a young boy that's struggling to deal with his mother's (Jones) terminal illness. His father (Kebbell) left them some time ago, and his grandmother (Weaver) is extremely strict and unfriendly towards Conor (but she does love him, and his mother, very much). Conor is also severely bullied at school. In order to try and deal with his problems, Conor imagines a tree monster (voiced by Neeson) that continues to visit him and tell him dark stories. The stories contain valuable life lessons, intended to help Conor deal with his problems (even though they're often very confusing as well). The film has some pretty cool visual effects in it, and they couldn't have cast a better voice actor than Liam Neeson (especially as a friendly, but very scary, tree monster). Jones and Weaver also both give outstanding performances in the movie as well, like they always do, and MacDougall especially shines in the lead. He's very convincing, as an extremely emotional, and very passionate, young boy! Bayona is definitely a talented director as well, and the script is pretty well written. It's a great coming-of-age tale, but I wouldn't recommend it for children of all ages (really young ones will probably be bothered by it). It's the type of film I probably really would have enjoyed as a kid, even though it is (like I already said) extremely slow- building.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/xGBv2IpDjDc",A Monster Calls,3416532

63,CineMuseFilms,a gut-wrenching tale about death and grieving,8/10,7 August 2017,"Don't be fooled: it may be labelled a fantasy but the content of A Monster Calls (2016) is brutally realistic. And ignore the trailer: it does not come remotely close to describing a story of the horrors inside a young boy's mind as he helplessly watches his mother deal with terminal illness. Too bleak for young audiences and mislabelled for those older, it is one of the most gut-wrenching films this writer has seen in a long while.There are two closely interwoven story lines at play: one is a magical fantasy, the other a tragic drama. Thirteen-year old Conor (Lewis MacDougall) is withdrawn and bullied at school as he experiences raging frustration over his mother's (Felicity Jones) worsening illness. Each time the hospital unsuccessfully tries a new treatment his hopes are dashed. He has fits of destruction and is desperate to understand what the grown-ups are keeping from him. He hates living with his strict grandmother (Sigourney Weaver) and his remarried father (Toby Kebbell) leaves him feeling even more abandoned. Nothing can break Conor's cycle of despair and time is running out. Drawing deep from his young sub-conscious memory, he reconstructs a monster story told long ago by his mother, one that empowers his desperate search for a happy ending. Her long-forgotten painting of a magic yew tree like the one outside his bedroom becomes his psychological crutch and he fantasises it as a powerful magical sage that can cure her illness. The tree comes to life with destructive menace to others but kindness towards Conor as it tries to teach acceptance of things that cannot be changed.The brilliance of this film lies in the way that story unfolds not just from Conor's point of view but from deep inside his turbulent mind. Conventional cinematography and narrative structures position us where the director wants us, but this film goes much further. Through the sincerity and emotive power of the amazing young Lewis MacDougall, we viscerally feel what he is feeling. While we see magical happenings on screen, the role of monster and magic in this narrative is entirely cathartic. Some viewers may need a degree of forgiveness for the unimaginative CGI tree monster and its magical doings. The sinewy hyper-masculine beast with flashing lights from every crevice might startle ten-year olds but it is a tame cliché for older viewers. Some of its dialogue sounds preachy like ""heroes don't always win"" and its make-believe destructiveness can be repetitive. But these are minor distractions compared to the emotional punch this film can deliver.Conversations about death and grief are difficult at any age. From the outset, the film's narrator explains that Conor is somewhere between boy and man. By the end of his sad journey, he has grown emotionally and learnt about letting go. Much more than just entertainment, this sensitive coming of age tale is an honest conversation about some of the most complex feelings a human can ever experience.",A Monster Calls,3416532
64,garrya-91199,A must see for those facing the loss of a loved one,8/10,25 December 2019,"What can I say. This is a movie that appears to be aimed at those who have to live with the fact that someone close will die in the not too distant future. The underlying theme is how to comprehend this imminent loss and live the rest of your life without it eating away at your insides. Brilliantly thought out, but a little slow for those outside the lesson parameters. All hospitals with cancer patients in particular should have a copy of this film to show to close family members of those who are about to die.

65,exlana,"'too old to be a kid, too young to be a man'",8/10,2 November 2022,"... and that's how i also feel about A Monster Calls. It's a fantasy-family film that tell a sombre story about a boy who has to cope with his mother, while making an unlikely friend with a tree monster. With its heavy topics, it approaches grief and death in a very mature way. This film kept it real, telling it how it is, without being condescending to the audience.I like the way this film dictates that 'real life' is not black and white unlike fairytale, while uses a literal tree monster to tell these stories. Though you'll figure out how this film ends, it still manages to keep one twist to makes it even more devastating. Overall a really good watch, stellar performance by all the casts.8.4/10.

66,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Emotionally resonant and visually vibrant.,7/10,19 August 2018,"'A Monster Calls (2017)' is the kind of 'fantasy as allegory' that's so often made all the less ambiguous, one way or the other, precisely because of its format. Film isn't quite able to achieve the kind of unspoken uncertainty that novels often inherently carry, considering the all-encompassing perspective of written first-person narratives, but not every story is meant to work both literally and figuratively - though many often do and I can't speak to the intentions of the source-material (which I haven't read). My point is that some material perhaps has more impact if it makes itself as definitive as possible. Such is the case with this feature, which never really has any pretences about its more outlandish elements and always frames them as the coping mechanisms of a child - though the occasionally more tangible moment does break this illusion somewhat. While the stranger elements perhaps don't work as well as they would have in a piece totally told from the perspective of our unreliable narrator of a protagonist, the film comes together to tell a tale as old as time in a distinct way that actually allows it to be widely accessible and incredibly emotionally resonant, to boot. 7/10.",A Monster Calls,3416532

Along the way of his suffering he befriends a giant monster that will tell him stories in hope that Conor will finally accept things how they are. How movies goes it gets darker and darker and stories of monster get darker. Behavior of Conor also gets more violent and disturbing but finally it will get to point of his acceptance of things. In the events of his father arrival and points where he rejects his grandma the most it was a huge relief to have him but it will turn to be a dramatic and painful also.

Visually superb movie with some great and dark scenes but astounding projection of monster and great scenery. Performance by Lewis MacDougall (Conor) is great as he is leading the whole movie on his own without any trouble.

I watched this with my daughter and we both found it difficult (not emotionally) to watch. The film is shot in such a way that you feel like you are in the front row of the cinema. Everything was zoomed right in on.We created our own fix by watching it in windowed mode that allowed us to reduce the screen size to 75%. Once we did that we could settle in and enjoy the show. Others may not have this impact.The film itself is absolutely amazing, so unique and entertaining and the effects are first class. The 'monster' is a superior visual version of Groot.The casting is spot on as each actor contributes to the sincerity of the story.An underlying theme of forgiveness is very fitting for an honest story such as this.Awesome :)",A Monster Calls,3416532
70,Wookieetreiber,"Sehr gut, aber kein Kinderfilm",9/10,8 January 2020,"Zunächst einmal muß ich festhalten, daß der deutsche Titel einmal mehr völliger Schwachsinn ist, aber sei es drum. A Monster Calls ist ein zutiefst bewegender und berührender Film, der es schafft eine ernste Thematik sehr behutsam aufzuarbeiten, ohne dabei auch nur im Geringsten kitschig zu sein.Allerdings ist dieses kleine Meisterwerk in meinen Augen absolut kein Kinderfilm, respektive für Kinder mit 12 Jahren, wie es die deutsche USK vorgibt, definitiv nicht geeignet. Ich würde den Film ab 14 Jahren freigeben und das nicht etwa, weil er besonders gruselig wäre, sondern weil er sich mit einem Thema befaßt, das Kinder in einem gewissen Alter in dieser Form noch gar nicht richtig einordnen oder verarbeiten können (sollten).
Grob umrissen, ohne etwas zu verraten, geht es darum, wie ein Junge mit (ich glaube) 12 Jahren den Krebstot seiner Mutter erlebt und bewältigt und daneben mit allerlei anderen psychischen und sozialen Problemen fertig werden muß.Ich selbst habe aufgrund einer Krebserkrankung mehrere Therapien hinter mir und kann daher einigermaßen einschätzen, wie Kinder, Familienangehörige und Freunde sich dieser Problematik stellen. In jeder sozialen Gruppe findet das anders statt. Aber diese Variante hier ist ausgesprochen gut erzählt und mit einem Tüpfelchen wohltuender Magie garniert.Aufgrund der Medikamente, die ich nehme, u. a. auch Antidepressiva, vermag mich normalerweise nicht mehr viel emotional zu erschüttern. Diese Geschichte ist jedoch so gut, daß selbst ich noch ein paar Tränen übrig hatte.Ganz großes Kino!",A Monster Calls,3416532
71,eddie_baggins,A box office bomb that deserves an audience,6/10,29 June 2017,"At one stage or another it seemed as though A Monster Calls was set to become one of 2016's breakout hits.Positive reception from initial trailers through to a fair portion of glowing reviews, once The Orphanage and The Impossible director J.A Bayona's film hit the public spectrum it only but enhanced this adaptation of Patrick Ness's novel of the same name chances of becoming a hit with a wide audience and even perhaps a hit with Academy voters.Fast forward to now and A Monster Calls can officially be described as a box office dud that failed to make it into cinemas in Australia until now whilst barely making a dent in the box office overseas where it was largely forgotten about in the X-mas rush, despite a critical rating of over 80% on review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes.A hard sell in many ways and an awkwardly targeted film, this is a movie that's themes will go over many younger audience members heads and is perhaps too ""fantasy"" driven for some older audiences, Bayona's visually arresting and sometime emotionally resonate film is a film that often feels torn between being too many things and while it's hard not to appreciate elements of this unique take on the cancer drama sub-genre, you almost wish it had become more of master of one than a hodgepodge of too many ideas.One thing that is mightily evident outside of Bayona and his teams impressive visual feats, especially when talking about Neeson's CGI creation of the tree like Monster, is Bayona's continued solid work with his performers and after drawing out such memorable turns from his young cast members in The Orphanage and The Impossible, its quite clear the director is a skilled developer of young actors.Here led by Lewis MacDougall as young boy Conor who is struggling to cope with his mother's (played impressively by Felicity Jones) life threatening cancer, Bayona extracts a memorable turn from the young performer who has to do a large amount of the films heavy lifting. While the film may struggle in ways to connect us at all times to its hybrid of metaphorical monsters, storytelling and dramatic family conundrums, the efforts of those involved here can't be faulted.Final say – Elevated by a unique visual tone, memorable acting turns and some spot on voice work by Neeson, A Monster Calls is a solid film but one that could've been so much more.If we look back but a few months, that talk about this film becoming a true classic seemed to be legitimately on point but this final product leaves one with a feeling of being let down even though emotions for some may run deep as the runtime draws its closing periods.Still, Bayona is a director to get excited about and his upcoming sequel to Jurassic World should likely be quite the thrill ride.3 destroyed lounge rooms out of 5",A Monster Calls,3416532

73,SquigglyCrunch,Brilliantly Impactful and Perfectly Balanced,10/10,12 August 2017,"A Monster Calls follows a young boy whose mother is suffering from cancer and how he meets an imagined tree monster who teaches him how to cope via stories. For starters, every cast member kills it. Lewis MacDougall as the main character is outstanding. More often than not child actors don't work out, and even if they are good they have a few hiccups here and there. This kid didn't. Not once did I cringe at his acting abilities, nor did I ever not buy a single thing he said. He was fantastic. The supporting cast, including Toby Kebbell as the father, Sigourney Weaver as the grandma, Liam Neeson as The Monster, and especially Felicity Jones as the mother. Each one at first embodies what may seem like a clichéd character at first but very quickly and organically brings immense humanity to each role. One of my favorite aspects of the cast is how they are used. MacDougall fills the screen for most the entire run time, whereas the rest of the cast are supporting characters, but it never feels like any of them should've received more or less screen time. We got just enough time to introduce each character before humanizing them, and as a result it all flowed together so well. The directing is fairly good as well. J.A. Bayona knows his way around a camera, and while the movie very much feels like a mainstream Hollywood movie with a good budget, he still manages to add his own flair to the way he shoots it. The character of The Monster consumes a good chunk of screen time, and thankfully he looks fantastic, along with all the rest of the special effects. The way he moves and talks and interacts with the cast are all fluent, and not once did I disbelieve anything I was seeing on screen. Sure, it is obvious that The Monster is CGI, but it was never distracting, and I recall even audibly acknowledging how good the effects were as I was watching the movie. And furthermore, The Monster tells stories and there are almost always stylized animations to go along with it, and each are distinct and beautiful to look at. The writing is fantastic. The dialogue is very well written, and the way the story is carried by both the real life story and the stories told by The Monster are engaging to say the least. The characters are relatable and investing, and each one plays off of each other incredibly well. I'm not afraid to admit that I was crying a fair bit towards the last half as a result of these characters. Even characters who maybe hadn't received a whole lot of screen time made me cry, which shows just how well they were written in such a small amount of time. The last act in particular is fantastic. Certain scenes towards the end show that the movie doesn't hold any punches, that it's willing to get right to the point over censoring itself. And as I said earlier, it honestly made me cry. There were a few little things that I really appreciated about the movie as well, such as the name Lewis MacDougall being credited first at the beginning. So often mainstream movies advertise their biggest actors first, regardless of how small their roles are, and it's very refreshing to see a no-name child actor receive a credit first. Another thing was the sort of 'twist ending'. It's not really a twist, but there are two interpretations of it: a happier one and a darker one, and I appreciated that the movie was willing to present both those options to the audience, that the movie could actually be exploring something much different and more real than what the average audience member might pick up on. Overall A Monster Calls is outstanding. It's excellently performed, written, directed, and filled with top notch special effects and gut-punching emotional content. I absolutely loved every moment of this movie, and I can't wait to see it again. In the end I would definitely recommend this movie.",A Monster Calls,3416532

Both feeling guilty for wanting it to be over, for letting go and needing to learn that it was okay.

75,Reno-Rangan,An alternate way to confront the reality.,7/10,24 August 2017,"Based on the British novel, made by a well known Spanish director. This film might remind you the titles like 'Finding Neverland', 'Where the Wild Things Are', 'Neverwas' et cetera, but still it is unique. Particularly for the message it carried out. Many lines were awesome, inspiring for those whose world are crumbling down. Emotional, as well as one of the best recent children's films.The story of a boy whose mother is severely ill. He starts to have weird dreams, following, an appearance of a tree-monster from the nearby cemetery. The monster is to tell a few tales and at the end of it, he has to tell the truth about his nightmares to him. So as the days go by, it becomes more challenging to him to confront the reality. He can't run away from all, but to face it and those are the remaining narration.While being a kid, they believe every fantasy tale have narrated to them. Even a picture of those tales would influence to have an imagination in their daily life activity. This film does not hide anything from the viewers just to bring a breathtaking twist at the finale. So, you would know what's happening, but why, is the puzzle to solve. Even that is not a hard nut to crack. Though the purpose of the film is to reveal how some children cope a tragic event in their life, like perhaps the film 'Before I Wake', with misunderstanding the words said by the grown ups to them. This is really a wonderful film for kids, as well as for adults. I Hope you won't miss it.7/10",A Monster Calls,3416532

As his mother deteriorates, he is cared for by his grandmother (Sigourney Weaver). His absent father (Toby Kebbell) returns from working in America. When the clock strikes 12:07, a monster visits to tell him tales.It's dark tale. MacDougall's sunken eyes perfectly fit the mood. The visually are effectively stunning. The drawback is that it's imaginary. The monster is causing damage like Gozilla but none of it is real. The boy does do damage himself which is compelling. In some ways, the monster is a distraction. I imagine a different kind of monster which is more horror than action would add to the intensity.

He awakes the monster that wants to tell him three stories and hear one in return. Starring Lewis MacDougall as the boy, Felicity Jones as the mother, Sigourney Weaver as the grandmother and Liam Neeson as the voice of the Monster.There's are no more Tolkien or Potter movies left to show this year but every self-respecting holiday season needs a larger-than-life fantasy epic, so we have been given ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" and ""A Monster Calls"" instead.I have commented on ""Beasts"" already which is probably better of the two. Both are basically visual effects oriented family movies but ""Beasts"" aims lower on intellectual level which allows it to deliver with more ease on spectacle level. ""Monster"" tries to be both a thoughtful story – think along the lines of ""Little Prince"" – and effects show. It does give us both, and both kind of work too, but the result feels more artificial than heartfelt, sadly.To the director's credit, J.A. Bayona (""El orfanato"", ""Lo impossible"") is adept on creating suitably ominous atmosphere and getting a solid performance out of newcomer MacDougall as a boy driven to the edge by hardships in life. All the other characters are more like part of the decorations, so no need to stop on them.But surprisingly for a near two hour movie, storytelling feels rushed almost all of the time, so the characters and events lose most of the impact they could have had. The result has all the emotional heft of a good-looking music video.

The subject matter is serious and dark, and it could be scary for a young audience. There's also a depiction of bullying on multiple counts, which could be too real for the young folks. Getting past that, I think the film is a bit of a mixed bag. Without getting into spoilers, the fourth story and reveal of Conor's nightmare is done very well. The thing is you kind of have to sit and wait for it and the film spends periods just limping to the end.The delivery of the film is intriguing. I wasn't blown away by the CG monster but there is an air of familiarity hearing the voice of Liam Neeson beaming from the giant. The stories are entertaining and told from a graphic heavy perspective (which is fine), its the in-between the story moments that are really hit or miss. There are areas where the film is at a standstill which makes me wonder if the film would have worked better as an hour long special. Its a bit of an ambitious effort from a filmmaker who usually has an interesting story to tell but it comes down to the source and how it can be adapted.I was thrown off a bit by Sigourney Weaver in the film but thought Felicity Jones was good. It was harrowing seeing her as the film went on and seeing her progression get worse. There are a few heavy moments in the film that could get a casual moviegoer to shed some tears, but for me I can't escape how disengaged I felt at many points in the film. The way I see it, this was probably a very interesting novel but not one that could be adapted properly because its thin.6.5/10",A Monster Calls,3416532
79,Padreviews,6/10 Superb acting by Lewis MacDougall,6/10,11 January 2017,"Let's start with the positives ; huge praise has to go to Lewis MacDougall his acting was superb. Relationships between his character , his mother , father and grand mother develop over the film but really get to the point that you feel engaged enough, enough to invest the emotion in the subject matter , it's only in the final minutes of the film that you're able to connect the dots . I found this element a shame I would have preferred to have been emotionally drawn in earlier . Prior to that the only relationship you feel engaged with is the tree and Conor but that isn't enough to draw you into the film taking into account the subject matter. Having not read the book I can't comment on it's transition but the back story intrigues me as this is an extremely personal piece of work posthumously completed by Patrick Ness from an idea by authoress Siobhan Dowd who sadly died of cancer before she could complete the book. From a purely commercial point of view I'm surprised ,though grateful , it stayed true to the book and was filmed in the U.K. , A huge gamble on a $40m budget ( particularly as it's a US/Spanish production) perhaps why it flopped in the US? The story could have easily been transformed to Ireland but I'm guessing with the success of Harry Potter , the U.K. is now a safe bet for middle budget fantasy movies . That leads me to the CGI which was excellent and fitted seamlessly into the live action. Liam Neeson was an excellent piece of casting . I had expected to enjoy the film more , I expected to be drawn in to the subject but found myself sad but not sad enough to feel engaged . I didn't come away thinking I've got to tell everyone to see this film and that's where it failed . It's not a bad film just not a great film. If it was a School report i'd say 'Could do better'! Peter Jackson would have been a better choice of director.",A Monster Calls,3416532
80,ttreakle,A perfect movie!!!,10/10,5 April 2023,"Wow I just finished watching this movie and man did it deliver. The acting was superb,the story was amazing and the cinematography was gorgeous. This really hit home . The love between a mother and son just... I cried. That third act really hit me hard. Liam neeson as the voice of the monster was a excellent choice. Lewis macdougall should've won a Oscar for his performance along with Felicity Jones. This movie is definitely in my top 10 for 2016 and could possibly crack my top 10 of all-time. There's nothing more for me to say except check this movie out. It's a great watch and don't forget some tissue.Timothy Treakle.

82,TheOneThatYouWanted,Good but overrated,7/10,13 September 2020,"I honestly want to give this a 6.5 but most films nowadays s&$k so I guess I need to start ranking the somewhat watchable films a little higher. The film has good acting and a well done story but over use things too much and draws out the film to make it much longer than it should have to be. There is a moment where someone from the main character's past comes around and spends time with him. Watching it felt like an hour because the whole thing shouldn't have happened. Personally, I think they just scored a major actor to play the role and didn't want to trim him out of the film. That is just one thing that hurts this film but it is still an okay watch if you're into heavy films.

83,sjalkarjadottir,above average,7/10,4 January 2018,"I liked it. Acting was well done and the story was fine, too .. but a little stereotypical. I had expected a darker tone though .. and was periodically a little bored.To me, it felt like a very, very silent, slow movie .. with very predictable storyline. I particularly liked Sigourny weavers performance.Maybe i did not quite enjoy it as much as it deserves, cause my friend was constantly complaining about not watching a ""real horror"" movie.The effects were .. well.. not very good though.. it felt like there were comprable cutscene effects in some video games - and the CGI did not blend in with the live action well.

84,ThomasDrufke,Messily Ever After,7/10,8 January 2017,"Storytelling is the very reason that we have the medium of film. Everyone loves a good story, and they may re-telling even more. It's something that our species has done since the very beginning. A Monster Calls takes that love for storytelling and imports it into a heartbreakingly human tale about a boy losing his mother to cancer, and how his imagination can help him cope with this devastating situation.As I mentioned in my review for 'The Orphanage', J.A. Bayona does quite well at telling stories about the bond between a mother and her son. But unlike 'The Orphanage', 'A Monster Calls' deals more with the son's side of this relationship instead of the other way around. And although I think this may be Bayona's weakest film overall, there's no question that he has a serious future in this business. He has a knack for creating unbelievably human emotions out of his characters even in the most imaginative situations.The imagination of this film was another thing I really appreciated. It's not your typical cancer film, in fact, it hardly focuses on Felicity Jones' character who has cancer. We spend much more time with her son, played by newcomer Lewis MacDougall, and his imaginative tree monster friend, voiced by Liam Neeson. I love the way the monster looks and is physically represented in this film. It's him who has the film's best scenes, and most creative and visceral moments. As depressing as the subject matter is, Neeson's monster brings plenty of subtle humor and visually satisfying scenes.I think one of the problems this film faces is that it's utterly predictable. You pretty much know the direction that each of the characters are going from the beginning. Yes, Bayona's direction is unique in structure, but the story doesn't end up anywhere different than what I initially thought. Sometimes that doesn't bother me, but for some reason it did here.Overall, A Monster Calls is visually stunning, well-acted, and uniquely structured. So even though the plot ends up going exactly where you expect, there's enough under the surface to let the some of the mishaps slip by.+The monster steals the show+Beautiful cinematography+Bayona always nails human emotion-Disappointingly predictable7.6/10",A Monster Calls,3416532
85,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Emotional and engaging film that could help children learn to talk about difficult emotions,9/10,24 January 2017,"Grief was a prominent theme at the movies in 2016, but no movie has tackled that anger and helplessness quite like ""A Monster Calls,"" this year, or ever. Using magical realism in familiar but effective ways, ""A Monster Calls"" breaks down the pain and guilt of loss and suffering in a way that's accessible for younger audiences yet authentic to adult experiences.Adapted for the screen by Patrick Ness from his own novel and brought to life by J.A. Bayona (""The Impossible,"" ""The Orphanage""), ""A Monster Calls"" tells the story of a 12-year-old Conor (Lewis MacDougall), a daydreamer who loves to draw, is bullied at school and whose single mother (Felicity Jones) is extremely ill. Beaten down by life, Conor is paid a visit by a massive monster (voiced by Liam Neeson) that emerges from the nearby yew tree despite Conor's pleas to be left alone. The monster tells Conor that he will visit him three times and tell him three stories, and the fourth time, Conor will tell him a story, a story that will reveal the truth, a truth of which he is very afraid.The film bounces between real-life scenarios in which Conor must deal with his worsening mother, strict grandmother (Sigourney Weaver) and even his estranged father (Toby Kebbell) visiting from America, with encounters from the monster after midnight each night at 12:07. As one would expect, these fantastical episodes reflect and inform Conor's everyday drama and emotions.""A Monster Calls"" is at its most captivating in the imaginative sequences featuring the monster and his stories, especially toward the beginning before the real-world story picks up steam. These digital water color animated fairy tales, especially their editing and visualization, provide a tremendous boost in energy that draws us further into the story as a whole despite the fact that they technically digress from the plot. They also provide young viewers with a familiar story structure to convey important morals and messages that pertain to Conor's experiences, messages normally too complicated for fairy tales. Ness' story (based on an idea by Siobhan Dowd) personifies emotions and inner struggle in a way not all that dissimilar from Pixar's ""Inside Out."" The monster guides Conor and teaches him lessons, but he is also a projection of Conor's subconscious that embodies his feelings of rage and inner torment. Through the monster, Conor learns how to express himself during this tumultuous time. Thankfully, the adults on the receiving end of his real-world expressions respond in productive ways.Conor's mother, grandmother and father have flaws and challenges that affect Conor in different ways, but Ness makes sure they don't provide even greater obstacles for him to overcome. It's enough for a character to navigate the family dynamics at play when someone is dying, to throw in the complications of an adult who makes things worse might be more true to life, but would distract from the core messages the film is trying to transmit. Still, Jones, Weaver and Kebbell can show how their characters are struggling too and not simply be perfect rocks for Conor to lean on. MacDougall also has a lot of promise as a young actor. This is a part that requires a lot of emotion and yet a lot of restraint. He must have enough imagination to add to the magical scenes and enough of a grip on reality too. Viewers of all ages must also be able to see part of themselves in Conor to empathize rather than just sympathize with him. MacDougall absolutely keeps us engaged emotionally as the film unfolds.""A Monster Calls"" is an emotional film punctuated with the spark of imagination, one that combines beauty and fantasy with tragedy in a way similar to Guillermo del Toro's ""Pan's Labyrinth."" It's not all that discrete in what it's doing or how it operates, but the intent behind it and the truth about the world that it wants to address is too admirable and important to dismiss. More than anything else, if ""A Monster Calls"" helps just one parent and child talk about grief, loss, guilt or anger it will have justified its entire production. More people just need to see it, and it undoubtedly will.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more",A Monster Calls,3416532
86,Rendanlovell,A solid way to start 2017.,7/10,5 January 2017,"The first thing I have to say about 'A Monster Calls' is that you should steer clear of any trailers or marketing for this film. It may be hard to avoid it because it feels like it's everywhere right now. In front of various YouTube videos, almost every movie, and endless commercials promoting it as a sappy feel good movie. Yet upon seeing the film, what it's actually about is a child growing up. Of course, we have seen the countless coming of age stories that are very bland and by the numbers. And while this one is that, it's only that to an extent. The reason that clichés and tropes exist is because, if done well, they work very well. It's when they are just forced in that they become annoying.That's what's great about 'A Monster Calls'. It acknowledges the clichés they are using and makes them feel necessary to the story. The story here revolves around a boy that gets pushed around and is just a sad young man. His mom is very sick and he has to kind of take care of himself while also taking care of her. The thing that most films like this get wrong is that they show everything happening around the young kid instead of showing how the things around him affect him.That's what this film does very well. It shows what's around the boy without straying from his perspective. It tells its story through the main characters point of view. Throughout the entire film, we hardly ever leave his side. In doing this we are able to live through him and see the world as he does. It makes everything feel more personal and emotional.Which was refreshing to see. Normally these kinds of films force feed you information by either blatantly telling you what's happening or leave our main characters side to show you something nearly unrelated. 'A Monster Calls' never does that. Everything that you need to know is shown to you as Connor learns it. We don't know hardly anything he doesn't. And while this type of story is pretty see through it's still able to hold its own weight.Despite us being able to predict the entire film from frame one, it is still able to make you feel for these characters. Which is pretty rare for these coming of age stories. Outside of how the film actually tells the story, the biggest surprise here was both the special effects and Liam Neeson. I kept waiting for a scene where the effects took me out of the film due to a bad render or green screen.But that scene never came. I was constantly engaged in what was happening and was able to actually care about Neeson's treebeard character. Who, for me, was the best part of the movie. He plays the monster with such charisma and character that it's nearly impossible not to love him. It really is a treat to see how Neeson just became this character, unlike another tree that says only three words...However, this film isn't anything mind blowing. It's one of those mom/grandma kind of movie. It's very safe, predictable, and ends up tugging at your heartstrings. It's the kind of movie where you see it and then forget about it within a week. There's nothing miraculous about it. It's a well crafted and smartly written film but it doesn't do anything other than just being a coming of age story. It's pretty transparent and easy to follow without a ton of thinking involved. Which isn't inherently a bad thing. The film remains good despite this. It's nothing to write home about but it's a solid way to start 2017.",A Monster Calls,3416532
87,rannynm,"New, Unique and Compelling. Moved me to Tears.",8/10,17 January 2017,"This film is just amazing! The monster is very realistic, the plot is new, unique and compelling, and the movie moved me to tears. This is an adapted story from the award-winning novel. The story begins when Conor O'Malley (Lewis MacDougall) meets a monster (Liam Neeson) during what Conor thinks is a dream. Conor already has enough on his plate with bullies at his school, his mother's (Felicity Jones) illness and the pressure that his grandmother (Sigourney Weaver) will take him away from his mother. Plus, Conor's father is living far away where he cannot support his child through the mental and physical challenges that he is undergoing.Lewis MacDougall portrays Conor O'Malley extremely well. He draws the audience into his world and really makes them experience his pain. The way that MacDougall shows how Conor loves his mother and doesn't want her to go makes everyone feel heartbroken. MacDougall pulls you in with his great acting skills that make this film enjoyable as your mood swings form tears of joy to extreme sadness throughout the whole movie. The monster's appearance looks extremely realistic. The monster's body is very detailed with multiple branches sticking out of it and you see the branches grow and entangle everything they come across. I also love the sound effects. Whenever the monster wakes up and comes out of the ground, the sound of breaking branches and his growl are very realistic which make him seem completely real. My favorite part of the movie is when Conor and his mother are together in his mother's final moments and the monster is there watching over them. It is really touching to see them together, but sorrowful at the same time because, you know that the mother has to go. It really moved me seeing how much they love each other.The message of this story is that you have to learn to face the truth and accept it. You can't hide from your problems and expect them to go away. You must accept the truth. You have to be strong and learn to let go and move on. This movie is really spectacular and riveting. I give it 5 out of 5 monster stars. I recommend it for ages 12 to 18. There is too much drama and death for younger viewers. You can find this movie in theaters now. It is truly wonderful and you should definitely check it out.Reviewed by Jolleen M., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic. For more reviews by youth, visit kidsfirst dot org.",A Monster Calls,3416532
88,stuart-12777,Apart from the climax it's an average film.....,6/10,20 January 2017,"Having gone to see the film on the recommendation of two renowned film critics, I just had to share my review. This film is not a classic and is nothing like or even close to the beauty, fantasy or story of Pan's Labyrinth which has been a comparison.There are other monster, dragon, fantasy films that are much better.Apart from the last 30 minutes which are admittedly very well acted, tearful and sad, most of the film is a disappointment losing it's story line and identity along the way. The child actor is good but the rest do not not engender warmth into their characters. In short it is a film that does not worthy it's current 7.8 rating.",A Monster Calls,3416532

The mystery, the story line and the creativity that has created this world is absolutely heart-breakingly beautiful. Having loved the book I had high expectations for the movie, and oh boy were they met. This is not the film to watch if you're not in the mood for a few tears, but gosh are those tears worth it. I highly recommend it to anyone. Its a relationship between a boy and his mother- and how he has had to grow up too fast.I truly don't understand why this film is not everywhere winning every award there is. So So SO good!

90,lbk99-geo,See it while you still can!,10/10,10 January 2017,"I went to see ""A Monster Calls"" earlier today, expecting a good movie, and instead found one that was amazing to watch. Below is a quick description of how the movie starts out, with some comments following.The movie opens with a nightmare, apparently a recurring one, which Connor O'Malley (Lewis MacDougall) has. In it his mother (Felicity Jones) is falling into a pit, and he is holding on to her to save her life, but ultimately she falls to her death. It is a terrifying dream for him, but scarcely less terrifying than some other aspects of his life; including dealing with his mother's losing battle with cancer.A monster (voice wonderfully by Liam Neeson) comes to visit him and while somewhat terrifying it simply says it will visit four more times, telling a story each time, and the fourth time listening to the true story of Connor's nightmare. In between visits we learn more about Connor's life, including his absentee dad (Toby Kebbell), his grandmother (Sigourney Weaver), and some difficulties he has with bullies at school. Not wanting to spoil the movie, I will not give away any further details. However, suffice it to say that the true enemy Connor battles is not the monster, but much more real life issues.As the story goes on I found myself rapidly drawn in, and immersed in Connor's point of view, while as an adult still able to see things he did not, but in a way that did not distract from the story. Connor as the movie states is ""too old to be a child, and too young to be a man"", yet he finds himself face to face with sorrow and loss that is deep. The story uses the monster, his stories, and Connor's life as a moving example of dealing with loss and finding a measure of triumph in the midst of it. I rarely cry at any movie, but the ending of this one had my eyes moist with tears.The acting is excellent, the special effects well done and not distracting, and the story deeply moving and engaging. The movie is a strange mix, since it is really a drama, and a well done one at that, but the title, age of the protagonist, and the partially animated sequences (for the monster's stories) might make some think it is a children's movie, which it is not. I suspect this, and a lack of effective marketing, might make the box office poor for this movie, a pity since it one of the best I have seen in a long time.I watched the movie alone as I often do at first, but plan to return next week with the rest of my family to share it with them. Given the less than spectacular box office I suggest if you have not seen this movie you plan to do so ASAP while you still can.",A Monster Calls,3416532
91,SpoilerAlertReviews,A charming yet dark fantasy.,7/10,1 January 2017,"I actually got to see this at a Screen Unseen last month but had put off writing the review until the right time of year, or should I say, the right year. And wow what a year of movies 2016 glad us. So this is going to be the first official review of 2017, ahead of Assassin's Creed and Silence. Director of The Impossible, J.A. Bayona, gives us a fantastical fairytale of boy meets monster, where imaginations run wild with the boy tries to cope with tragic realities. Conor, played superbly well by Lewis MacDougall, fitting the awkward, introverted schoolboy, is troubled, from a broken family, he lives with his dying mother, played by Felicity Jones and whilst what faces him is inevitable, he decides to battle against it, even against himself in a way. His imagination and distress appears to summon a mythical monster that resides upon the hill, in the graveyard outside his home. Essentially he's an Ent, or more like a Groot with a vocabulary, with the wondrous voice of Liam Neeson who would make an excellent voice for a Decepticon Transformer. The imagery is amazing and the animated parts very enticing, reminding me very much of Harry Potter: The Deathly Hallows. But, it feels like it's cut short, skipping a pivotal part, rushed over, almost feeling cheated, I wanted and expected to see more, even though it does seem long for 108min running time. There was a moment where this film reminded me a lot of The NeverEnding Story, thinking it was going to head that way but no, it's a different film entirely and it's only Conor's escapism that bares resemblance to the classic '84 film. It's undeniably beautiful and has such a touching story, but there's a chance younger viewers might not understand, however, it's not strictly a children's film with a 12A rating. There's a good score from Fernando Velázquez but nothing totally rememberable. The performances are strong, Sigourney Weaver is great as the opposing grandmother, but I don't think Toby Kebbell's father role was explored enough and there's a couple of weak spots that might disappoint. Overall it's a charming and yet rather dark fantasy that tells a story of a boy struggling with life whose imagination comes frees him from those shackles of guilt and fear. Running Time: 6 The Cast: 9 Performance: 9 Direction: 7 Story: 7 Script: 6 Creativity: 8 Soundtrack: 7 Job Description: 6 The Extra Bonus Points: only a 5 for the enchanting animation bits, would have been a 10 but I wanted more of it. 70% 7/10",A Monster Calls,3416532
