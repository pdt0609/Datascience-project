0,room102,Awful,1/10,10 August 2016,"My god, that was AWFUL. Just random made-for-trailer tiny scenes that add to nothing, have zero depth and don't make up a coherent plot. Wall-to-wall inappropriate songs that come at random times. Boring plot (if you can even call it that), boring and indistinguishable flat characters. Harley Quinn was annoying. Jared Leto did his best as The Joker but had absolutely nothing to work with - he just appears at random times for a few seconds and disappears. There's no depth and no story. If you've seen the trailers, you basically saw all the one-liners and ""money shots"".If all that isn't enough, the last third of the movie is simply unwatchable.I don't think David Ayer is a bad director (I liked HARSH TIMES and FURY), but this is definitely his worst movie yet and I'm pretty sure it's due to massive pressure from the producers.

1,Hitchcoc,Just Too Much,2/10,28 October 2019,"I remember as a child when Universal decided to take all the monsters (Frankenstein's monster, the Wolf Man, the hunchback, Dracula, etc.) and have them all in the same movie. These were the worst of the series.. This is another case of too many characters, no plot, no substance. I guess it won an award for costuming but the characters demand that they be costumed to be the characters. Don't bother.

2,TheLittleSongbird,"The potential was big, the waste of it was even bigger",3/10,30 September 2016,"'Suicide Squad' didn't sound so bad in hindsight. The concept was actually pretty interesting and there is a good deal of talent in the cast. Unfortunately what should have been a winner turned out to be a sore loser, even more of a wasted opportunity than 'Batman vs. Superman'.The costume and production design is both brooding and vibrantly colourful. There are two performances that are good. One is the enormously fun but also just as deliciously deranged Margot Robbie, her Harley Quinn being the film's most interesting character. The other is a menacing Viola Davis, proving that even a stony face makes one feel uneasy. El Diablo is also entertaining, and one of the few characters to be used right and feel necessary.However, for me Will Smith didn't work. You don't see him as Deadshot, you see him playing himself in wooden fashion here and plays Deadshot too jovially, something that Deadshot isn't really, that he also had two introductions gives an indication that the writers didn't know how to characterise the character. Enchantress is a pretty lame villain played with all cheese no menace by Cara Delevigne, while Jared Leto's Joker proves pointless and misplaced to the story (other than giving Harley Quinn backstory which wasn't fleshed out enough). Likewise with the Batman of Ben Affleck, while Killer Croc has nothing to do.One of 'Suicide Squad's' biggest failings is its treatment of the characters. Only Harley Quinn is fully fleshed out, while many characters are either given short shrift or either there was no use to them being there, for example what was the point of having Slipknot and then dispatch the character so quickly and cheaply. This is the consequences of having too many characters and a very muddled story that not only feels rushed but also incredibly confused. The script is equally a mess, with forced and very lazily-written jokes.Visually, other than the costume and set design, 'Suicide Squad' doesn't have the redeeming value of looking good. Editing is choppy and the special effects range from average at best but mostly amateurish. The action scenes are very routine and less than thrilling, chemistry is extremely limited and suspense is next to zero. Plus the music is too constant and far too loud that it becomes a nauseating assault on the ears.In conclusion, could have been a fun film but flounders badly due to lame execution that wastes its characters and much of the cast (with only Davis and particularly Robbie standing out). 3/10 Bethany Cox",Suicide Squad,1386697
3,Aaron1375,"In some bizarre way, this film just clicked for me...",9/10,8 August 2016,"I had heard that the reviews for this film were less than stellar so I was not sure what to expect. The reviews for Batman V Superman were not so good either, but I enjoyed that one and I am happy to say I enjoyed this one too. In fact, I thought it was more enjoyable than Batman V Superman. I cannot explain why, but it just really worked for me for some completely unknown and strange reason. Perhaps, it simply worked well with the myriad of mental issues I have and it blended well to form some sort of connection with my warped brain. I just do not know, but I am glad I enjoyed it as I took a gamble to see it in theaters and I would hate to shell out money for tickets and not like it. Not only did I like it, but the other two people I was with enjoyed it as well. It was not without its problems, which is why I give it a nine rather than a ten, but most of the issues are in the opening portion of the film. Once the squad is together and in the field the movie is off and running and it is nearly nonstop action the rest of the way.The story starts out with a woman with a plan to bring together a team of meta humans and those with special skills to combat any threat from a superhuman. Basically, it picks up where Batman V Superman left off and Superman is dead so not only is he not around anymore there is always the chance that another like him turns up and perhaps this one will not be as friendly. Well, we are introduced to the candidates who are criminals for the most part. There is Deadshot, an assassin for hire, Harley Quinn the Joker's insane partner in crime, Killer Croc, Diablo master of flames, Boomerang and a mysterious woman who is possessed by a being known as the Enchantress. Well that last one turns out to be a huge mistake as she releases her brother and together they hatch a plan to take over the world. The team of criminals are assembled and forced to help a special teams unit as in Escape From New York and are led by Rick Flagg who is joined by a girl named Katana. They must enter the city and retrieve someone important, but the Joker is tracking their movements as he tries to take Harley back!The actors and actresses all do a good job. I especially enjoyed Will Smith's Deadshot as he is probably one of the few people that can make an assassin for hire a sympathetic character. I also enjoyed Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn. A lot of people have been complaining about the amount of screen time Jared Leto's Joker received, but I thought how was presented worked as he is not a member of the team, he is just someone trying to get his girlfriend back and does so in strange ways. He was almost like Micheal Keaton as Beetlejuice, not really in the film for very long, but he made an impact any time he was on screen. The main problem I had with the film was the first portion of the film as it was at times, a bit hard to follow. The characters are introduced, but then it flashes here and there; however, this stops once the team is dispatched and after that it is almost all action the rest of the way.So it was not a perfect film and from all the negative reviews it is not going to be a beloved film by everyone. That being said I really enjoyed it. The music clicked for me, the characters clicked for me and the action was great and kept me entertained. That is all I can ask for. It also sets up next year's Justice League film which I saw a trailer for and it sadly had almost the same amount of humor in it than the entirety of Batman V Superman. The trailer was like two minutes long so that should say something. This film, too, had some more comedy and at the same time dark so it melded really well. I would love to see these characters turn up again in another Suicide Squad film or in other films in the DC movie universe as they really made the film work for me.",Suicide Squad,1386697
4,ayoreinf,Taking cartoon villains and making them flesh and blood one can root for,8/10,7 August 2016,"It's about 8.5 worth of a movie in my book, for some real good acting and well written roles. That is, some well written roles, had it been true with all the characters in this movie, this would've been a real masterpiece, but all too often it did fall short of the quality performance of Will Smith, Margot Robbie and Joel Kinnaman. there are a few other solid performances which didn't get their characters developed enough to shine like these three, especially Viola Davis who's very good as the perfect government agent that sees nothing but getting their job done, but truth is her role is too one dimensional, and there was room for real depth here. Same is true with Jai Courtney and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje. Jared Leto, isn't bad in his role, but it's hardly a role to speak about, and he was hyped from here to forever, so it was a letdown. But the roles that were properly written were really superb and the three actors I mentioned did them great justice. This together with a reasonable plot and solid technical aspects of this production, make it a worth your while movie. But once again this could've been a lot better, and the fact it's not is plain shame.",Suicide Squad,1386697
5,slowcloud,What's with these ratings? This is an exasperatingly bad movie,2/10,3 August 2016,"I don't get the ratings here. This is a cut and dry poorly made movie and fans of the DC universe deserve better. I don't normally post my reviews here. But I have to share my take on this movie because it just wasn't good. I didn't even have to go into spoilers to show how terrible it is. Movie goers shouldn't mindlessly consume these films. Christopher Nolan set a high bar, but producers and studios need to step messing with auteurs and maybe we can get a quality DC movie:There is nothing in Suicide Squad that shows any hope that an auteur filmmaker can do anything distinctive with the current cash cow of the Hollywood machine: the super hero movie. What Christopher Nolan once made his own has devolved into a predictable pastiche whose charms should be wearing thin on audiences. It doesn't help that the movie is also an example of how bad one of these films can be when it becomes watered down and designed to refrain from shaking up anything in the so-called DC Universe. Suicide Squad, a PG-13 film, was supposed to be DC's entry to rival Marvel's R-rated Deadpool. Even though Deadpool had its own problems as a self-aware action movie, it still had focus and a bravado that is nowhere to be found in Suicide Squad.Suicide Squad follows a group of villains with super powers released from prison as part of a government plan to protect the world from terrorists or whatever sign-of-the-times fear currently plaguing society (Zika?). Starring Will Smith as the hit man Deadshot and Margot Robbie as the Joker's manic girlfriend Harley Quinn, alongside several other less familiar DC baddies, these guys are supposed to be complex people who have long fallen from grace and are supposed to rise above to find their humanity and gain the audience's sympathy. But writer-director David Ayer tries so hard to take a safe route, you can see the gears trying to manipulate audience emotion, revealing the inherit problems of these comic book adaptations straining to catch up with decades of printed storytelling.You can't totally blame Ayer, who last gave moviegoers Fury, an incredibly strong and startling war movie featuring a better fleshed out motley crew of characters. The preciousness Hollywood has for its ongoing world building of interconnected comic book films creates such tight restrictions on storytelling that anything that might upset that world has no room to prosper. At one point, toward the end of Suicide Squad, one character asks another, ""Shouldn't you be dead?"" Of course not, this is the DC universe, and it's gotta be milked. That means no major players should be written off in one movie.The result of these storytelling restraints is a soulless kind of filmmaking hampered by pussyfooting. It's like a syrupy glaze that drowns out any possibility to shine above what has become a predictable pattern of storytelling. Characters dole out uninspired lines that play superficially to feelings, like, ""Dad, I know you do bad things, but I still love you."" Then there are the clichés, like ""fight fire with fire."" Sometimes the script inadvertently deflates the tension by spelling things out. Someone over a radio says, ""Use extreme caution,"" and someone in the action responds, ""I don't like this."" But in case you miss that, someone else says, ""I don't like it either."" A kid playing with his action figures can come up with better chatter to establish tension....",Suicide Squad,1386697
6,SilverWolf47,They're the bad guys LOL,3/10,4 August 2016,"Disappointment. That's actually far better than what I felt after watching this movie. I wanted to leave the cinema about 30 minutes before the end but that's against my personal policy so I tried plan B but found nothing to poke my eyes out so I watched, and cried...-First, where is Deadshot? No, because all I saw from start to end is goody Will Smith playing the good family guy, very far from the cold hearted hired assassin he is supposed to play.-Second, what was that false publicity? The Joker appeared a lot in the trailer but he has absolutely no purpose in this movie apart from being the background story of Harley Quinn. Really, you remove him, you get the same movie but with only half of the theatre full.-Third, while I'm on her, the guys who made this movie obviously didn't get the relationship between Harley and the Joker. The Joker don't give a damn about her, she is his tool, he can throw her from a bridge without a second thought while Harley has developed a serious Stockholm Syndrome toward him. In this movie they are all lovey-dovey, at the end of the movie I nearly expected to see them leave in a car with ""Just Married"" written on the back with a ""And they lived happily ever after.""-The first half of the movie is actually not that bad, the villains really look and act like villains most of the time but everything started to fall apart after Will Smith reunite his troops after they failed the mission the first time, each one of them just want to drop everything and leave but then Will Smith says they can't give up and of course all the bad guys listen to him because he is Will Smith (God?). That was when I did my first face-palm.-This movie is 50% Will Smith, 40% Harley Quinn, and 10% the others. Really, apart from the first two, the others are just background characters, to make a comparison, in Guardian of the galaxy, you got one hero but you know the background stories of every members of the team, and they get their fair share of screen time. In this movie, they just don't care.-The jokes, sorry... The ""jokes"", well, I think the quotes speaks for themselves. Sometimes it's funny, most of the times it's not and sometimes they even try to explain the joke you understand but don't find funny. I think Warner tried to be more funny and less dark in this movie after they got some bad reviews about Batman Vs Superman being too dark but that's just ridiculous, they remade some scenes to add jokes and sometimes it even breaks the action.-And while I'm on it, Batman vs Superman had an impact in the DC Universe, it starts with the consequences of what happened in Man of Steel and at the end of it, the world has changed. In this movie, there is no progression of the DC Universe, it feels more like one of those filler episode you don't want to watch in any series.-I won't talk about the end of this movie because, as a sadist, I want you to go watch this movie and suffer during the two hours needed to finally reach the end credits. Just know that the last minutes are actually way worse than the rest of the movie. Enjoy ;)Anyway, as a DC fan, I wanted to see Harley Quinn in a movie but certainly not in this one. I really, really, REALLY hope that Warner won't use this movie as a reference to make Justice League because if they do I'll have to formulate an official request to DC so they can let Marvel do their movies :D See you all in 2017.",Suicide Squad,1386697
7,alexarag,Simply Not That Interesting,5/10,12 August 2016,"Is this movie terrible? Absolutely notIs this movie great? Absolutely not.I always heard from people that they either HATED or LOVED this movie. And for me it was neither.The audience for this film is served with a classic action movie/comic book. ""The world is in danger! There must be a solution! Although there are bumps between the characters along the way, eventually, we'll solve the problem""The interesting twist is *supposed* to be that instead of classic superheroes, we have bad guys. To that I say ""so what?"". The movie didn't really establish why I should care about much of what was going on on screen—it was all just classic popcorn movie action and sequences that were occasionally broken up by half-attempts at character development.",Suicide Squad,1386697
8,Sleepin_Dragon,Not my cup of tea,3/10,4 November 2018,"I sometimes feel a little disconnected as I'm not a lover of superhero type films, but I'll always compromise and go and them with friends. Perhaps I'm just unlucky, I was made to sit through Batman Vs Superman, and then this, I felt as if I were being punished for something, based on the film it just have been something bad.Two hours of wall to wall nonsense, there was virtually no plot of any kind, or what there was went over my head. I can't say the acting was bad, Will Smith I really liked, and despite not particularly being a huge fan, I'd say one of Cara Delevingne's better performances.Some great special effects, perhaps a film if have enjoyed if I was twelve. At this very time I'd have to say I thought it was very poor. 3/10.

9,piecookie,It's just a mess,5/10,3 August 2016,"This movie tries to be so much but ends up being a real mess.Where do I begin? Character introduction runs for almost 40 minutes and I still don't end up giving a damn about anyone.Jokes are often very misplaced and feels extremely forced. Many scenes feels like they were made solely for sake of the trailer and also the trailer resembles nothing of what the actual movie is like.CGI is so off that I divide the movie into 2 teams, CGI-team and real team, and I keep ending up thinking how the ***k is human team going to beat world consuming superman-like characters.However I do like the look of the Villains, especially Enchantress.Maybe this film is the best thing for DC Universe superfans, but for the casual viewer it's very hard to get a grip of this movie, at least for me it was.",Suicide Squad,1386697
10,IsabelM11,Worse than Batman v. Superman,4/10,4 August 2016,"Trying to keep up with the plot of this movie is like chasing a moving train. Except even when you think you've caught up to it, you're not sure you want to get on board. As someone who went into this movie with tempered expectations thanks to negative critical reviews, yet also hope it would have some redeeming moments due to the overall positive IMDb user reviews, I can honestly say that the critics may have won on this one. Suicide Squad has a number of issues, but is not a total loss for comic book fans. The performances by the actors is not what stops this film from being a success, but it doesn't stop their characters from going in the wrong direction. 1. THE PLOT: The plot was pretty much a mess. This was a common complaint about the Batman V. Superman movie: the plot defied logic and had too much trivial sub-plot due to the amount of characters. Suicide Squad runs into a similar problem. I feel like they compensated logic to simply include scenes that would satisfy comic book fans, however it's at the sake of the film's success as a whole. Nothing is ever explained that you want explained. And somehow the movie is a confusing blend of predictable yet unclear. I found myself constantly asking ""Why wouldn't you just do____?"" 2. Not enough screen time for the other squad members: The rest of the squad (Other than Harley and Deadshot) are not fleshed out well. And the movie's feeble attempts to add background, dimension or complexity to the characters fails, with flashbacks and random monologues that don't elicit any sort of empathy from the viewer. I found myself easily not caring about the squad or its success at all. (Example in point 6)3. PACING: I think the attempts to flesh out the characters failed also because of the way the movie is paced. It's about 2 hours, yet feels like a 30 minute movie. Scenes jump around quickly and what they do choose to drag out (flashbacks amongst other things) may be fun to watch but is unnecessary. 3. Overuse of Music: A little more nit-picky, yet nonetheless something I noticed. Now I'm for every character having a cool theme, and soundtracks are great but... Suicide Squad utilizes loud, distracting, CONSTANT music... over dialogue, over key scenes.... music accompanies everything. Or at least that's what it felt like. Don't get me wrong sometimes it works. 4. THERE ARE NO STAKES INVOLVED WHEN YOU'RE FIGHTING MONSTERS MADE OF GOOP: I worried about the antagonists of this movie when I saw the trailers. None of the fight scenes have any real tension or meaning, because of the type of monsters they're fighting. Faceless, CGI, magical goop. 5. Uneven Dynamic of Power: This is a big issue I have with the movie. A lot of the characters seem extremely unnecessary and frankly misplaced, due to the disparity of power between all of them. In Batman V. Superman, people worried about how Batman would stand next to Superman, Wonder Woman and Apocalypse. In Suicide Squad it just felt wrong that a girl with bat and a guy with a boomerang were even within two feet of a guy who can breathe fire and a woman who can tear a hole in the sky. You simply don't believe Harley, for example, is needed in the group, which throws the logic of the film out of wack. Or that her bat can rip apart monsters, when Waller's bullets don't pierce them or Katana's sword. Not sure if this is a popular opinion, but the thought definitely occurred to me. 6. Katana : Out of all the characters in this movie, Katana's character was the biggest wasted opportunity (Boomerang is a close runner up). I'm not too familiar with her character in the comics, but I've looked up a couple strips and she's speaking English. THEY FREAKING SUBTITLE HER IN THE MOVIE. She can't even communicate with the damn squad. She could have been a character that could bond with them and be pretty cool, but she's reduced to a non-English speaking, body guard. And the film's attempts to humanize her couldn't be more ineffective. I had hoped this character would be utilized stronger and better.7. The Joker : I never thought I'd say this in my lifetime, but this film should not have included the Joker. He should have full gotten his own movie or only been in certain scenes. Jared Leto does a great job, and he's definitely a scene stealer. In fact, I could see people leaving this movie thinking he was the best part or the only redeeming quality (Which in my mind is actually Will Smith), but I did enjoy watching the Joker. But his appearances made no sense in the context of the plot and felt fairly forced and random. I was expecting complex schemes from him or maybe an interesting sub plot, but that's not what I got from the movie.8. Still Fun to Watch : The movie with all its faults is nonetheless fun to watch at times and the performances aren't bad. There are particular moments that I think are done well or include nice cinematic details. Batman v. Superman is overall a better film, but Suicide Squad is definitely more exciting. In conclusion: It was difficult to keep this review fairly spoiler free, but I think I did it. Suicide Squad may become your next ""guilty pleasure bad movie"" film, but I think the average viewer will definitely find the film to be subpar. I did, and I hope this review helps you.",Suicide Squad,1386697
11,yoyopa,Why and How is Will Smith the star of this movie?!?!,1/10,8 August 2016,"Where to start...woe is me...where to start?!?! First I'll say I was looking forward to this movie for a long time..like many people. All I really cared about was of course...the resurrection of The Joker!I think Jared Leto has the kind of God given talent that can never be taught to any actor. He was born with it, like Nicholson and Ledger before him. So needless to say I was absolutely stoked to see what he would do with such an iconic character. I didn't really care much about anything else. Which leads me to say WOW! The marketing on this film was the definition of false advertisement. There were so many interesting story lines to play with here. The Joker and Harley Quinn with their demented love story wouldve been my first choice. It was Jared Leto and Margot Robbie that shouldve been leading this movie...NOT WILL SMITH! guys I can't stress enough how much i dislike Will Smith. Guys this whole movie revolves around Will Smith playing Will Smith in a movie where he's supposed to be playing Deadshot.God I can't stress enough just how much he ruined this movie for me. Basically he did his whole schtick from Hancock but threw on an extra layer of ""stereotypical hood black guy"" and called it Deadshot. As an African American..I cringed every time he opened his mouth.Sorry about my Will Smith melt down...he is just really awful.I really would've liked to understand more about Enchantress..there was definitely not enough time to establish her at all. The ""Villains"" were literally moving props whose only purpose was to slow our heroes down.Also, I'm not sure Cara Delevigne has the gravitas to really dig into Enchantress...but I could be wrong...The fail on June Moone could very well all be on David Ayer's shoulders. Also the CGI for Enchantress and her movements in the final sequence were actually laughable. I couldn't take her seriously.Diablo was the only actual Metahuman and they didn't explain his origin whatsoever. Not in a meaningful way anyway. Captain Boomerang wasn't terrible..not memorable either. Killer croc was there...could barely understand anything he said...but he was there...and apparently loves BET(GTFOH). Viola Davis was solidly cold hearted as Amanda Waller. Davis, Leto and Robbie were the only strong points of the film and there was not nearly enough of them.Personally, I really enjoyed Batman V Superman. I know the plot was a bit of jumbled mess and the bat vs supes was like 5 mins long and then there was Doomsday..ugh. But I still really liked it. There was a lot of it that dealt to me very believable circumstances. I can't say the same for SS...I never bought it. Not once did I sink into the story of the characters...I was always very aware I was in a movie theater watching the fresh prince flap his lips.To the folks at Warner Bros..ya'll need to step your game up..and do it quickly. You cannot keep making sub par movies like this. I'm this upset and I didn't even have to pay to see this movie. I can't even imagine the folks that are shelling out hard earned money for the 2 hour crapfest I just sat through. Jeez man...What a waste of Jared Leto. Save your money guys and pirate this crapfest in a week.",Suicide Squad,1386697
12,Tweekums,The 'Dirty Dozen' with super-villains,7/10,21 April 2019,"After the death of Superman those in power worry how the Earth would cope if the next super-powered being to turn up used their power to defeat rather than help humanity. To that end Task Force X, AKA the Suicide Squad, is established; a group made up of the most dangerous super-villains who have been captured! Of course they cannot be trusted but with an explosive charge placed in their necks they might just behave. When a threat emerges they are led by Col Rick Flag to confront that threat... which just happens to involve the woman Flag loves.Even before I watched this I'd heard it was pretty terrible... I wouldn't say it was that bad but it could have been so much better. Too much of the film's opening was dedicated to showing us how the various villains got caught; something that wasn't really necessary. Then when the action started much of it was too dark... as in it was hard to see what was happening. Tonally it wasn't dark enough; these are meant to be super-villains but the film didn't seem that violent... it would have been better had it been as violent as 'Kick-Ass' or even 'Dredd' but I guess the makers wanted a teen-friendly rating. The cast are solid enough; Margot Robbie stole just about every scene she was in with her performance as the crazy and dangerous, but still likeable Harley Quinn; Jared Leto impressed as The Joker, although his character wasn't in the Squad and was sorely underused. Overall I'd say this was entertaining enough but if you expect something great you are likely to be disappointed.",Suicide Squad,1386697
13,fred-verde,Who the hell approved this piece of crap?,1/10,23 August 2016,"Story line: what story line? - Wasted really good characters.

Not even at home. Just make a new movie in your head and pretend that this one does not exist.

14,ronakkotian,A very poor attempt in making a Suicide Squad film,2/10,9 August 2021,"WARNING: *MILD SPOILERS*To prepare for The Suicide Squad, I decided to rewatch the 2016 Suicide Squad and it was even more painful than last time.Suicide Squad is about a group of imprisoned supervillains that are recruited by a secret government agency in order to save the world from a dangerous threat.The DCEU have been really struggling and when Suicide Squad was slated to come out, a part of me was excited to see something different from the studio. However, before the 2017 Justice League film came out, I considered this to be the worst DCEU so far. The story has potential but the way it was told was so amateur. The script is one of the worst. It's filled with expository dialogue, that fails to flesh out characters properly, and jokes that do not work at the slightest. For a film with such a colourful poster, why does it look so ugly? Most of the film takes place at night and doesn't even look lit properly, the action is also incredibly dull with the final fight being so poorly shot and lit that I didn't know what was happening and the build-up to these events were so boring that I nearly fell asleep. The editing is some of the worst I've seen with scenes coming and going with no real structure and sometimes it would cut to these vibrant colours that felt so jarring due to the ugliness of the rest of the film. The soundtrack is filled with well known pop songs but they don't fit the scenes they're playing over. It's trying to be edgy but none of it feels coherent.The film introduces all the characters and gives plenty of time to explain the backstory behind Deadshot and Harley Quinn whereas the rest (Captain Boomerang, Killer Croc and El Diablo) get barely a minute. None of these characters are given proper character development and there's only one scene where the film tries to have these characters bond but it completely fails as it made me feel nothing. We also get introduced to another character named Katana halfway through the film. Not only is her introduction purely expository but her character is given nothing to do. Then we have The Joker, which may be the worst part of the film. Jared Leto isn't completely at fault since the script is terrible but his portrayal is still laughably bad. Margot Robbie is perfect for Harley Quinn and I love her in the role but she's given some of the most cringey lines. The villain isn't given anything to work and so her character is very bland. Viola Davis and Joel Kinnaman try their best and Will Smith essentially plays himself.Suicide Squad is one of the worst comic book films I've seen. It's trying to be so many things but it just comes across messy and dull. With poorly developed characters, an awful script and boring story, I wouldn't recommend anyone see Suicide Squad.",Suicide Squad,1386697
15,sHabbadooo,"Apparently it's good to be bad, should be DC's tagline",1/10,9 August 2016,"Where to start, where to start? This is probably the main problem of the DCU at the moment. They're playing catchup to Marvel, they see Avengers they want in. The problem is, Marvel have spent 4,5 & 6 movies setting it up. We care if Cap gets hurt, we understand the Hulks turmoil and we saw Starks motivation for donning the suit. But here we're introduced to a whole new cast, backstory and all, in 30 mins tops. It just doesn't work, it's rushed, it's lazy and it has no effect in making the audience care about these characters; which in a movie where the stakes are so high, does not bode well. So here's what I thought of each character:Will Smiths Deadshot - has by far the most screen time and manages to annoy in every single scene. He hits all the clichés, slo-mo gun catch, CHECK. Says the movie title, CHECK. Even when he's playing a cold blooded assassin, he's a good guy. Rating 2/10Margot Robbies Harley Quinn - looks the part, has the voice, has the insanity. It works well. Some of the jokes miss and some of her stuff is very repetitive but she's the best of a bad bunch (pun intended) Rating 7/10 (let down by the writing, she's great as Harley)Jai Courtney's Boomerang - here's something I never thought I'd write. Jai Courtney acted well in this film. Criminally underused, could have been such a Deadpool-esque self aware character but again the writing (and Will Smiths screen time) sold him short. Rating 6/10Jay Hernandez El Diablo - starts off boring, does some fire stuff and some CGI stuff. Lame. Rating 3/10Viola Davis Amanda Waller - the best part of this film, even if her motivation is kind of all over the place. She's menacing, but justifies it. Rating 9/10Cara D Enchantress - Abysmal. She can't act, simple as. Why she got the job is beyond me. She's monotone, she has no emotion, she just can't act. Stop. Stop giving her parts. She's awful. Rating 0/10Joel K Rick Flag - Insipid. Boring. Tom Hardy would have been miles better. But I wouldn't want to hurt his career by being in this trash. Rating 2/10Killer Croc 4/10 pointlessKatana 3/10 pointlessSlipknot 0/10 pointlessBatman 0/10 pointless (just in it so he can be in the trailer and sell more tickets)Jared Leto Joker - Pointless. Again only for the trailer to sell tickets. He's weird, he's creepy, but he is NOT the Joker. He's Scarface with mental problems and a fetish for tattoos. They used very similar imagery to Heath Ledgers in some scenes. But then went batshit crazy (pun intended) in others. Unlike Heaths Joker who had a clear plan of just wanting chaos, this Joker is just meh. Take him out of the scenes he's in and it wouldn't change the scene, take his scenes out of the movie and it wouldn't change the movie. He's hardly in it but he gets a 10/10 for disappointing in every scene he's in. Rating -10/10Finally, it wants to be the avengers, it wants to be Guardians of the Galaxy, it wants to be the Dark Knight, it wants to be Deadpool, in the end it was just another DCU film. A ringing endorsement if ever there was one.",Suicide Squad,1386697
16,jadepietro,Bad Company,7/10,6 August 2016,"(RATING: ☆☆☆½ out of 5 )THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED. IN BRIEF: Another sci-fi superhero fantasy that follows the formula alright but just isn't super.GRADE: B-SYNOPSIS: A band of rowdy misfits battle evil forces.JIM'S REVIEW: Bad is good. Let me re-phrase that...bad is kinda good. David Ayer's well-made but dull Suicide Squad is essentially a war film with ""flying men and monsters"", including a wicked woman who is ""a whole lotta of pretty and a whole lot of ugly"". There is a lot of chaos on screen, but most can be found in the film's muddle of a script. Its characters are ""bad to the bone"", but so is the weak screenplay.Is it as bad as most critics are saying? No...absolutely not, but it is not as good as it could have been. With a better script and a better villain (more on that later), the film could have been an all-out hit. The backstories of these misfits are the most entertaining parts of the film and Mr. Ayer's introduction of these personalities is concise and affecting. But his action sequences generally disappoint, with sub-par CGI and in-your-face rootin'-tootin' shoot-outs and gunfire, the kind of violence without consequences. Some of the jokes between the killer crew land, most don't. Much destruction and mayhem is present without the blood splatter and body count. (Still, the film's PG-13 rating is highly questionable.) The film also has little originality. It's more piecemeal of other films of this genre; some good (The Avengers series, Guardians of the Galaxy, Ghostbusters) and some bad (Sucker Punch, Green Lantern, Fantastic Four). It takes a worn-out premise from westerns (The Magnificent Seven, The Hateful Eight) and war films (The Dirty Dozen, Inglorious Basterds, the director's very own, Fury) of assembling a rowdy bunch of bad-asses to do the dirty work and save the world.Still the director continues to be a promising talent. (His 2014 film, Fury, made my Top Ten list for that year. It was a superior film with strong performances and excellent production values.) However, this offering lacks the latter but does have the former. Fortunately, Mr. Ayer has cast his film very well. So let's talk about some of the film's assets, primarily the four lead actors' performances. Will Smith as Deadshot, a hit man with perfect aim, aims perfectly with his character and gives one of his best and most believable performances in a long while. Joel Kinnaman as Rick Flag, a mercenary soldier in charge of the squad, brings gravitas and vulnerability to his character. Viola Davis delivers the menace in large portions. But the real scene-stealer is Margot Robbie as the deranged Harley Quinn, a Kewpie doll who packs a wallop. Her acting has great nuance and she underplays the hammiest of lines. This just may be the breakout role the actress needs to become a big star and she is electric, the perfect fanboy fantasy. (This gifted actress is making a nice resume with her role choices.) The problem with Suicide Squad is the rest of the pack aren't that interesting and are sketchy and poorly drawn (again, the fault of the script). The actors in these parts are good enough, especially Jay Hernandez as the fiery conflicted Diablo, and an underused Jared Leto as The Joker. Yet the other characters, as written, are largely forgettable: Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), Boomerang (Jai Courtney) and Katana (Karen Fukuhara). The balancing act of bringing all of these marauders together becomes a jumble of forced equal screen time. Less would have been more.Beside a sub-standard screenplay (written by the director himself), the other major hurdle is the film's villain entitled The Enchantress, a laughable Mati Hari-type vixen that shimmies and gyrates and may radiate powerful gamma rays but displays no conflict or personality, let alone posing as a real threat. Without a real baddie at the center of the turmoil, the film has no sense of jeopardy or tension. The actress playing her, Cara Delevingne, rarely enchants, but she does keep a straight face throughout the film so that alone is a credit to her profession.Suicide Squad is not quite dead on arrival, as most reviewers might have you think. Due to some fine acting and some of Mr. Ayer's images, it does have a steady pulse.",Suicide Squad,1386697

18,claudio_carvalho,Deceptive Film with a Lame Story,5/10,9 October 2016,"After the death of Superman, the leader of a secret agency Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) convinces the government to recruit super-villains imprisoned in Belle Eve to protect the world.

Margot Robbie steals the show and Jared Leto makes a creepy The Joker, but it is not enough to save this film. Waller killing her own team is not dark, but awful.

19,savage1250,An overly hyped film and a very unfortunate disappointment,6/10,13 August 2016,"Suicide Squad was a disappointment to me. May be I got hooked on the hype or was expecting too much from WB. This movie had a great concept that we saw on the small screen, both TV series and animated. For some reason, those formats did it better than this theatrical release. This movie suffered from all fronts, poor writing which is the number one problem for me. The story was just all over the place with such in coherency, it's visible at every point. Not enough time was spent in developing these characters for their introduction to the big stage. Poor dialogue was another major problem which is just so stupid at some points. But Suicide Squad still could have been saved with the main plot and a great villain. Sadly that too was a major problem. The main plot didn't make sense because the movie itself went in so many directions that none of it could have come together and gel.The villain was a total failure. Nothing about this person was intriguing and just falls so flat. Story and main purpose was so awful for a big summer blockbuster. This movie probably only had about two things going for it. Majority of the casting was great including Will Smith, Margot Robbie, Viola Davis, Jared Leto, and Jai Courtney. Yes Jai Courtney, I'm shocked too. I really think his role should have been expanded. Notable miscast would be Joel Kinnaman and Cara Delevingne. Joel Kinnaman portrayal of Rick Flag was out of touch of what that character should be and for Enchantress, someone, more older with more acting depth should have been chosen over Cara Delevingne. The other thing would be, through and through it's a much better movie than Batman V Superman. I know that's not really helping but still. A weak six stars and a onetime watch.",Suicide Squad,1386697
20,CANpatbuck3664,"Suicide Squad Delivers Interesting Characters and Great Performances, it Could Have Been Great but Ends up Being Just Pretty Good",8/10,5 August 2016,"I was beyond excited for this movie. From David Ayer directing (I loved End of Watch and Fury) to the cast (Margot Robbie, Will Smith and Jared Leto) and then those trailers were just fantastic. Everything I saw ahead of time said that this movie was going to be awesome and it would be the one to put the DC universe on track (I thought Batman V Superman was okay). Then the bad reviews came out and my hopes and expectations were completely dashed. So I went in with low expectations, ready to be ridiculed for having so much faith in the Skwad but I left the theatre happy. This is a flawed movie to be sure but there's some great stuff in it, I admit it's not the home-run that DC and WB needed though.One of the bigger things that critics have complained about is how simple and scattershot the plot is. Honestly, they're not wrong. There isn't a whole lot to this story as a whole, it's more about characters (not an excuse but the characters are more than good enough to carry it). The arc of the plot didn't bother me, a good portion of the movie is setting up the squad so it's not like defeating the villain was the sole goal of Suicide Squad. The editing can be pretty messy, the beginning of the movie has some of the best stuff but it doesn't flow well. I don't want to go into the behind the scenes news but it makes sense considering the news behind the editing process. I actually thought the movie moved at a good pace and it wasn't as jarring as the critics have said.When it comes to the characters, there's so many in this movie. The upside is that a lot of them are interesting but the downside is that there isn't enough screen time for everyone. The 2 main characters are Harley and Deadshot and I was impressed how the movie developed them. You get behind Harley's difficulties being controlled by the Joker, she kills people and does his bidding but she's been completely broken because of her psychological issues. Deadshot's weakness for his daughter would be corny in any other movie but the movie sells you on the fact that although he's a hit-man, he just wants an amount of normalcy with his daughter and he loves her. Another character who gets some good moments is Diablo, his story is pretty tragic and his story towards redemption throughout the movie was almost touching. To address the elephant in the room, I think the Joker was necessary because you couldn't have done Harley's origin without him (which was very well done) but he has little impact on the actual plot. I understand why they brought him in longer. How do you have one of the biggest comic villains ever in just a cameo? It wouldn't do justice to the character so I get the reasoning behind it.The biggest reason to go see this movie is that for a comic book movie there really are some awesome performances. Will Smith completely returned to form as Deadshot. Deadshot's persona wasn't too far from some other Will Smith roles but Smith looked like he was having a great time and he nailed a complex character. Will benefited from not being the moral centre of the movie and I think that playing a more morally gray character was a good thing to do and he was great. Margot Robbie was awesome as Harley Quinn. I was so impressed that she was willing to get down into the dirtier aspects of her character, she throws a lot of physicality into it even. She completely owns her scenes and if anything I'll be disappointed if this movie isn't a success because it should be her ticket to bigger things. I expected Deadshot and Harley to be good, the biggest surprise might have been Jay Hernandez as Diablo. There was a lot of angst to his performance and he stood out in a crowded group.Some of the other actors were great but I wanted to see even more of them. This is easily the best job I've seen from Jai Courtney, he hit it out of the park but he's mainly a background character. Viola Davis was also solid as Amanda Waller. Joel Kinnaman was fine as Rick Flagg. Cara Delevingne has taken a lot of crap for her dual portrayal of June Moon/Enchantress. She's not bad, she's not the strongest villain but she did a serviceable job. Last but certainly not least is Jared Leto as the Joker. I didn't have a problem with them doing a new version of the Joker but I didn't like Leto as much as I thought I would. He's creepy and unsettling but I didn't find him as threatening or scary as other versions. I understand a lot of his scenes were cut out though so maybe we just didn't get to see that side of his character.Every time I was just about to fall in love with this movie, something would snap me out of it. There would be an awkward cut, a bad piece of dialogue or the CGI wouldn't be as believable as it should (to be fair the action and the CGI are both pretty good throughout). I wanted this movie to be that game changer for DC but it fell short of that. It's not nearly as bad as critics are saying, it's a mixed bag but there are really good portrayals, good action and while it's not completely different, there's enough new stuff here to make it standout from the comic book crowd. I would be closer to a 7.5/10 but to counter the widespread hate around Suicide Squad I'll round up and give it an 8/10.",Suicide Squad,1386697
21,denis888,AN AWFUL MESS,1/10,15 March 2020,"My, what was that? I heard so many opinions and yes, they varied but I never thought my disappointment would be so big.
1. Actors.
No, even Margot Robbie did not impress me, at all. She overdoes, overplays, over-everything every singly frame and shot. In fact, her vapid delivery leaves an empty bewildered stare - why. Will Smith? Nay, too formulaic and very badly predictable. Jai Courtney? Nay, too bland and very heavily on the surface. The rest is intermittently forgettable.Ah, yes, there was Cara DeLevigne, probably, the weakest and the worst choice here, as her delivery is painfully bland and pointless.
2. The Plot.
Nothing new. You do this, if you don't - you Then we see lots of shootings, deaths and wild fights. Did we see it before> Yeah, lotsa times.
3. Video Effects.
Not bad, Again, nothing new.
4. The Joker.
That was the worst of the worst of the worst offenders of a hero of a choice of an actor. Shame, Shame,Conclusion - awful mess, rat salad, barbaric stew,

22,destroyerwod,"Don't listen to the so called ""critics"" , the movie is fun",8/10,11 August 2016,"This movie is super fun. Im gonna make it short, as everything probably been said many times. I was not fond of Will Smith being cast as Dead Shot, that's who i had in mind after watching the actor in Arrow. But Will Smith is so charismatic and fun he made me forget all about it. Marggot Robbie as Harley Quinn is just awesome. Even Jai Courtney is very good at Boomerang. Actually my only complain with this character is that there is not enough of him !!! lol The story is basic sure, but it work. Lots of great action. Look although i did like Deadpool, i tough this movie was even better, yeah no jokes.My only big problem with the movie is i am not a fan of Pimp Joker. I mean the actor did a great job with what he had to work with, but the look is completely off. Joker should NOT be tattooed, no matter if once in the comic he was or whatever. The street gang metal teeth look ridiculous too. But Jared Leto has the face for it tough, make up wise and hair colour, that was good. His acting was convincing.So yeah i had tons of fun with Suicide Squad, gonna buy it when it comes out on DVD for sure.",Suicide Squad,1386697
23,blueclementinex,It's not as good as your expect nor as bad as you heard,2/10,3 August 2016,"To start it off, i'm a big fan of dc cinematic universe, and the year 2016, hadn't been a good year for me and the other fans. Even though, i'll state myself optimistic, since actually, all my hopes and expectation fall into this movie instead. OK, Let's start with the strong aspects of the movie; performances and characters. well, i actually think this is what the director want to top off and show to the audience, thus forgetting the plot, which we will get into later. but the characters and the performances are well-performed- Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn really tops off my expectation. i'm a fan of harley quinn character, and she actually brought me the harley quinn i'm expected for- sexy, beautiful, it girl of joker's. while watching the movie, and whenever i'm feeling bored, harley quinn is there to make the scene fresh. and i think all audience, including audiences who didn't know her will love her and feel sympathetic to her. Will smith as deadshot actually didn't deserve much of my appreciation. i mean even though he's one of the great and strong aspect in the movie, i just thought i don't see will smith even trying to act, which weirdly works. watching Will smith here is just watching him using a kickass suit. Jared Leto as The Joker, is actually isn't the worst part of the movie (unlike what people might have said) i think that Jared Leto pull of a great effort into his character, and some scene of him showing up gave me goosebumps and own joys. but, maybe how little the scene for him is, or his character is pretty under-developed that just doesn't fit the puzzle in the movie. Viola Davis as Amanda Waller also brought up my her characther pretty well, as she played the cold-hearted leader Amanda Waller. other performances are great, like Joel Kinnaman, Jai Courtney, Jay Hernandez, Karen Fukuhara, and Cara Delevigne.The chemistry between the characters are great, as well as the development between their relationship. in my opinion, one of the strongest chemistry is Harley Quinn and Deadshot. Their chemistry is electric, funny, and watching them teasing, and slowly started to care about each other, is entertaining, and make me ship them together. even, i have a relationship that had a weak chemistry, that is Rick Flagg and June Moore's relationship which is bland, forced, and unnecessary. Now, parts that i think is the weak part of the movie, I think the plot is the main reason. The plot is lazy-written and under-developed,and at some point is pretty ridiculous. i don't want to get into it too much, since it will spoil some things, and i need you to watch the movie without spoilers, yet. even, i could tell you that the CGI is pretty cringy and sometimes, so does the visual effect between the scenes. the ending is actually rushed, predictable, and i think they could do better after building up the story of the fight scene.At the end, everything has its bad and has its good, what i really suggest for you to do is just lower your expectation, yet don't miss it either. it may not lift the hype as in the greatness in the trailer, but i think it's still a great fun must see summer movie , and you should enjoy it without all the overly negative critics.GUYS IM KIDDING THIS IS THE WORST FILM EVER DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME MONEY ON IT.",Suicide Squad,1386697
24,lillakurta,I am so-so sad :(,3/10,5 August 2016,"I am really really disappointed to be honest. I was waiting for this movie for so long, I loved Suicide Squad in Assault on Arkham and I was so happy when the news arrived about the live action movie. And as a massive Jared Leto fan I was extremely happy they chose him for the role of my all time favorite character, Joker. So I was hyped to see him, but the whole gang too. And what I got from the movie was equal with pure sadness. I mean, Jared was in it for a total 10 minutes and his role could have been easily left out, I only knew the characters because I read the comics and watched the wonderful animation (which by the way a 100 times better), the story telling was HORRIBLE, the actors could have been wonderful but they kinda lost in the terrible script. Will Smith, Margot Robbie and Viola Davis were fantastic but we didn't really get to know them... and the other characters were only there for... who know why? WHY DC, WHY? This story had so much promise and you ruined it... You should have adopted the Assault on Arkham into a live action movie... All these characters would needed a stand alone movie, and once we've got to know them then put them together... sure it would take years to build up a universe like that, but come on, that's what Marvel did and their movies are amazing! I am so, so sad right now... All of the actors deserve way better than this and they all have great potential",Suicide Squad,1386697
25,freemantle_uk,A fun ride,5/10,7 August 2016,"We have seen a multitude of superhero movies in recent years, from the ultimate good guys, bad-ass anti-heroes and revisionist takes on the genre. Now there is DC's Suicide Squad, a team of bad-guys who have to do high-risk missions for the American government.Suicide Squad picks up where Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice left off. Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) is a senior government official who wants to create a team of meta-humans to do the dangerous missions. Her recruits include Deadshot (Will Smith), Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney), El Diablo (Jay Hernandez) and Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje). The team is called into action when an incident devastates Midway City and to ensure compliance the members have an explosive device implanted in their necks.Suicide Squad is at best in its early potions when Amanda Warner introduces us to the members of the squad before their recruitment. It was an expository sequence but it was made with energy as it shows the backstories of the members of the squad, showing their rap sheets in brightly coloured text and embracing its comic book source material - there is a great homage to a famous comic book painting by Alex Ross.Warner Brothers went full out when searching for its cast and crew, getting David Ayer to write and direct and forming an all star cast. Will Smith and Margot Robbie got the most attention as Deadshot and Harley - Deadshot display Smith's on screen charisma, a smart mouthed criminal who knows how to play hand when negotiating with gangsters and the government. He was one of the most well defined of all the characters, having a rivalry with Rick Flagg (Joel Kinnaman), a Special Forces soldier who thinks the hit-man would run off. For fans of Smith you get more of what you like. Robbie was a perfect as Harley Quinn - speaking with exaggerated Brooklyn accent Robbie portrayal was like previous iterations in Batman: The Animated Series and the Batman: Arkham games, being a crazy minx who has unhealthy relationship with The Joker. Hernandez was also a standout as El Diablo, a man who wants to suppress his powers and seek some sort of redemption.Viola Davis and Jared Leto were also great in their supporting roles and hopefully we shall see more of them in the DCEU. Amanda Waller, a Machiavellian woman who would do anything to survive and protect 'national security' - she can become the DCEU's Nick Fury, a woman who does not have any super powers but can handle her own in a world of superheroes and villains. As she says in the film she has a talent for getting people to act against their interest. Leto is a terrific actor, but it was an unenviable task of replacing Heath Ledger as The Joker. Yet he succeeds - Leto's version of The Joker is a cruder and more sadistic character, someone who enjoys violence. The Joker was spurious to the plot, he was only introduced to the film so he can be ready for future DCEU films.Other characters were poorer presentations. Akinnuoye-Agbaje is a huge bloke and physically looks the part as Killer Croc, but the character may as well not have appeared in the film - he was just a thug and had no characteristics. The pitch of voice was lowered too much to be believable and it became distracting. Delevingne was miscast as Enchantress . Her human alter-ego is meant to be an archaeologist, but she looks like barely graduated from High School let alone have a PHD. When Delevingne first appears as Enchantress she had a creepy look to her, having a dark complexion and black smoke whirling around her. When Enchantress has her completed form she becomes less effective - she did jerky dance movements and her voice was dubbed with an older English voice which did not fit. The point was to make Enchantress other worldly yet it did not work.Warner Brothers and DC were aiming to make their version of Guardians of the Galaxy. They go to the point where they have a pop soundtrack like their Marvel rivals and are trying to match its tone. The film works best when it shows the relationships between the villains, delving into their past and the conflict of doing their job and their own self-interest. It made for an interesting twist to the superhero genre. However, after the great start Suicide Squad does not stick to its convictions and goes into familiar superhero territory of stopping a big bad guy trying to make a devastating weapon and the film attempts to give the characters a connection with each other, instead of showing them for what they really are, self-interested villains. The film also suffers from writing and editing problems, one character was introduced just so he could be killed.The problem with the DCEU is it's trying to catch up with the MCU, but by doing that it's trying to do too much too quickly - flooding their franchise with characters without much of an introduction. Marvel Studios were able to play the long game and it benefited the series because all the characters get an introduction and the various sci-fi, fantasy and paramilitary elements. Suicide Squad was a way for the DCEU to quickly introduce their villains (as well as some heroes) and it inexplicitly brings in fantasy ideas like a woman having a sword that captures the souls of the people it kills.Suicide Squad does not deserve some of the bad reviews it has received; it is still an entertaining and more ballsy attempt at a mainstream superhero film - it has a 15 rating in the UK. Its basic heroics plot is nothing new or that inventive, yet it does work changing up some of superhero (or should it be supervillain?) dynamics and it does a fine job at introducing some of the DC villains.",Suicide Squad,1386697
26,Troy_Campbell,Entertainingly eccentric.,7/10,6 August 2016,"The hype surrounding this deranged blockbuster couldn't have been any higher. The casting was bold, director David Ayer promised to bring his off-kilter style to proceedings and the trailers were downright awesome. That it doesn't quite reach the exceedingly lofty heights many were expecting shouldn't come as a shock, however there's enough fun and flair to ensure this demented romp all but wipes away the disappointment that was Batman v Superman. The tremendously enjoyable first act serves as a crazy meet-and-greet – with cool character title cards and all – establishing an excitingly wild tone, although this gradually dampens into something more generic by the bland and uninspired final act. The biggest problem with the last 30 minutes is undoubtedly how rote it feels, the dull CGI villains offering zero thrills and the climactic save-the-world sequence a muddled and dull affair with no ingenuity whatsoever. But what comes before the finale is oh-so-good. It's a rollicking ride of gunfights, swordplay and witty barbs as the titular ragtag group of anti-heroes reluctantly band together to defuse a mystical terrorist attack, or else be killed by the explosive chip implanted in their necks by ruthless government agent Amanda Waller (Viola Davis hamming it up). An early battle against mindless henchmen culminating in Deadshot (Will Smith) stepping up to single-handedly wipe the horde out is an action-based highlight, closely followed by a daring rooftop escape by Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie). Speaking of Robbie, she's arguably the standout amongst an overall solid cast, although Smith is as cocky and cool as ever, Jai Courtney is surprisingly excellent as Aussie bank-robber Boomerang and Jay Fernandez is suitably dangerous as walking flamethrower Diablo. The big question though: how does Jared Leto's Joker stack up against past incarnations? His laughing maniac is old-school gangster meets volatile nut-job, an utterly watchable psycho who commands the screen with every sneered line or outrageous cackle. Leto and Robbie share an amazing chemistry on screen, their energetic and erratic relationship – a comic-book version of Bonnie and Clyde if you will – is a ticking time bomb of death and destruction, which is why their limited time together is a crime. Not the mind-blowing film it could've been, but with one of the best soundtracks this side of a Tarantino flick and a wickedly cavalier attitude to accompany a wickedly cavalier group of (bad) good guys, Suicide Squad is an entertainingly eccentric entry into the DC Cinematic Universe.",Suicide Squad,1386697
27,uhsheen,"Great cast, terrible plot, mediocre action scenes and shoddy humor",2/10,4 August 2016,"I just got back from the movie and have a few feelings about it. It started out solid enough, we get to know the characters/motivations/weaknesses. Yes it was hurried but necessary and stylish.Then things drastically started to go downhill. DC's answer to Samuel Jackson is the stony faced Amanda Waller. She decides she needs to get these people together in case of another meta-human attack and by doing so she instigates the attack itself.So now we are faced with the big bad enchantress who we know nothing about and really aren't that committed to as a movie baddie. But that's OK... the bad guys aren't that important if our protagonists have good charisma with each other on screen. Here was my biggest issue. They just don't.The enemy ends up being a barrage of blackberry-headed minions and it begins to feel like an annoying video game. Step into a room, kill all bad guys, move on to the next room and repeat. To add insult to injury Rick Flagg even gets dragged away twice and has to be rescued like those ridiculous 'keep them alive' missions in video games. The action feels more suited to a war movie than to a comic book movie (perhaps the directors past is showing here)I wanted to like this movie, I wanted to like the characters but there were points where the dialogue was just so bad. TWICE, characters randomly hit on Katana to which she does not respond. It's not funny. TWICE everyone ends up ogling Harley Quinn. The attempts at humor in the movie were weak at best. Killer Croc utters so many pointless one liner's that are neither funny nor useful. It just didn't work. You want humor? When the characters are being shown their wildest dreams, give us a ridiculous seen with Boomerang. Give us some funny scenes with Diablo and stop saying 'esse' at him.I loved the romance with Joker and Harley.. give us more of that, don't squeeze the joker into a bunch of different personas.The bar scene was lovely, you felt the characters come close to something like a bond. Don't give us that at the end... give us that at the start of the movie, make us actually feel like these people mesh together well. They call themselves a family at the end but they have done nothing to merit that.Diablo had a cool scene at the end and Will Smith played an amazing Deadshot but I feel Rick Flag was just badly cast. I never really cared for the Rick and Deadshot scenes together on screen... It never felt like it really worked. Overall, I'll still watch DC movies, but I do feel like they are missing something that the Marvel counterpart has got right. Maybe it's heart, maybe Marvel just have more practice but I hope DC can redeem themselves next year.",Suicide Squad,1386697
28,chaitov,"I Cant See The Action on Screen,Too Dark.",1/10,8 August 2016,"OK.So I'm a senior.But I've seen lots of Marvel/DC Comics movies. I really liked Ant Man last year because there was a story to it.Suicide Squad was filmed in my home town, Toronto.There was so much hype.But even my grown son hated it when we saw it.There's no character development. We wasted our money.Don't go to this disaster. You'll regret it no matter your age.During each scene, I was wondering what is happening.Because the lighting was so dark,I couldn't make out the action. There were times I kept asking myself why I had agreed to come to this film. The character,Harley Quinn, had this Brooklyn accent which didn't really fit in. The joker was a joke,not even scary or comical.This was the worst movie I have seen this year.",Suicide Squad,1386697
29,jtindahouse,A hot mess,4/10,4 August 2016,"For the last 12 months it has been almost impossible to dodge the juggernaut of a film that is 'Suicide Squad'. It really has been everywhere. The trailers appeared to pretty much give away the entire film, and I was hoping that I was wrong and it still had a few tricks up its sleeve, however this was not the case. If you've seen the trailers you almost know the entire basic story line. This was very disappointing. Also, almost every clever one-liner (barring a few exceptions from 'Harley Quinn') was included in the trailers. Bring back the good old days of 'The Dark Knight' where the trailers were unbelievably epic, and yet gave away almost nothing of the plot. The movie itself it also a bit of a mess. There are so many characters, yet none of them are that strong. Quantity over quality never works, especially when it comes to movie characters. A breakdown of a few of the characters:Harley Quinn - undoubtedly the star of the show. Margot Robbie really impressed me in this role. She was far and away the best written character and a terrific performance made her an absolute winner. She alone pretty much carries the film and keeps some quality about it.The Joker - one of the greatest characters of all time, almost completely wasted. Did the writers understand absolutely nothing about what makes The Joker great? He's not supposed to be telling jokes, but he is certainly meant to make you laugh. Jared Leto does his best, but this part of the movie was a complete miss. Never once did he make me laugh, and never once did I find him overly menacing. A horrendously mishandled chess piece that goes a large way towards why this film is so bad. Heath Ledger must be turning in his grave.Deadshot - yuck. What an awful waste, of an already one-dimensional and useless character. His power is that he is an accurate shooter? Are you kidding me? Could there be anything more boring? Then add in that Will Smith is still trying to come across as the hero/good guy the entire movie and you have another horrible element to this film. I was really hoping Smith was going to take a leaf out of Dicaprio's book when he did 'Django Unchained'. Sadly, it's nothing like that and is simply annoying.These are the only characters really worth mentioning. The rest are purely there as filler. The DC universe is in real trouble at the moment, after the abomination that was 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice', and the reason is simple: they aren't hiring the right people to make these films. What made 'The Dark Knight' so unbelievably powerful and successful? Christopher Nolan was at the helm. Now not every film maker is capable of the standard Nolan can produce, but what irks me is that nobody is seemingly even trying to imitate what he achieved. These films are so far from what he was producing that it's ridiculous. 'Suicide Squad' has almost no story. That's unfathomable in this day and age. DC has a lot of films coming up in the near future, and unless they get a film maker on board capable of turning the tables around, they're all going to be equally as dreadful as this. It's now or never for change, but I fear they have no intention of changing.",Suicide Squad,1386697
30,smittysays123,Corny and predictable,1/10,20 August 2016,"Talk about corny jokes, this movie is full of them. The story is so predictable and the characters are not good at all. Will Smith as Deadshot, bad, Harley Quinn, annoying, Killer Croc unbelievable, boomerang dumb, Joker just ridiculous.How did this movie get a 6.8? This was just dumb and the plot made no sense. Where are all the regular super heroes that originally caught the ss? Flash, Batman, etc...I really didn't want to see this to begin with cause even the previews looked corny and bad but my son wanted to go so I took him. Save your money and watch it on video, it won't be long.

31,NileFortnerBoogieBuddha954,David Ayer brings something new for the DC Cinematic Universe.,8/10,7 August 2016,"HEY PUDDIN', THE JOKES ON YOU! IS SUICIDE SQUAD AS BAD AS EVERYONE IS MAKING IT OUT TO BE? Villains, come in many different shapes and sizes. Some iconic villains have even stolen the show from the hero, and are capable of winning fans over. After the outcome of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, the U.S. Government is concerned about how they will deal with future threats. Bad – ass babe Amanda Waller, played by Viola Davis (The Help, Prisoners) sees the arrival of Superman as a wake-up call. She uses the fear of Superman's abilities to fight the U.S. Government into letting her unit Task Force X, a group of their worst imprisoned criminals. The intent is to send the team on suicide missions against super-powered threats in exchange for time off their rather lengthy sentences. This film has been receiving some bad reviews, and a lot of negativity. Do I think it's a perfect movie? No, far from it. However, I believe the film has an amazing cast, great soundtrack, it felt like a comic book on the big screen, well acted performances, colorful, it's fun, funny, and it felt like the DC Cinematic Universe is actually starting to connect more naturally. I honestly don't understand all the negative reviews, and hate this film has been receiving. Honestly, I like it a hell of a lot more than Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. Out of all the actors and actresses so far in the DC Cinematic Universe, the cast in Suicide Squad is easily the best. Will Smith, as Deadshot is the most well rounded character, with back-story, character development, and screen time. If anything, I consider this the Will Smith movie a.k.a. Mister July a.k.a. Big Willy Style has his career comeback. I do agree with what some critics and fans are saying though. I believe Will Smith is the main character, because he is the biggest selling point for this movie. Also, at times I believe he was acting like Will Smith instead of the character Deadshot from the comics. Viola Davis completely owns the role of Waller. She really is mean, fearless, intelligent, determined and as Will Smith said to her in the film, gangsta. She dominates everyone she shares a scene with and makes them look ten times as small. I'd love to see her character come back in the future.""YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT THE CRAZY ONES."" Another standout is Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn. If you're not familiar with comic books and or the character. You should know that Margot Robbie had a ton of pressure on her taking on this role. If you go to any comic convention, there are literally many women dressed as Harley Quinn (That's why I like those conventions ha-ha). In my opinion, Robbie will satisfy fans, newcomers who may not know the characters, and moviegoers. Robbie manages to capture the spirit of Quinn from the animated series as well as the newer version from the comics while still making the character work for movie audiences. If you talk about Harley Quinn, you also have to talk about Jared Leto as Mister J a.k.a. The Clown Prince of Crime, better known as The Joker! Leto had to face even bigger expectations. I'll admit, when I first saw the picture of Jared Leto as The Joker I wasn't feeling all that strong about it. I literally said, ""He looks like what would happen if Lil Wayne and Marilyn Manson would have a baby together). Nevertheless, after seeing him here, Leto took on the role and I really feel like he delivered. His Joker brings a lot new to the character and is significantly different from the performances of Heath Ledger, Jack Nicholson, and Mark Hamill. In my opinion, this Joker was a mix of various Jokers. Jared Leto's reminded me very much of the Joker from DC Comics The New 52 series Endgame story-line, Batman: The Killing Joke, Ledger, Nicholson, and the novel Joker by Brian Azzarello. Jared Leto is not trying to be Heath Ledger. He is trying to do something different, yet stay true to the character we love (or hate). I actually would love to see Jared Leto come back as The Joker. I heard many of his scenes were cut from the film, and personally, I'd love to see more. So these are my final Bitchin' Buddha thoughts on the film Suicide Squad. Even though the director David Ayer (screenwriter for Training Day, Director of End of Watch) mentioned he is not the biggest comic book fan, I believe he constructed a well-done comic book movie. It has a good cast, music, and it feels like a comic book movie. I believe this film would have been even better if it were rated R, not trying to be as funny, and kept the tone of the very first trailer we saw. It's not a perfect movie, but I personally enjoyed it. For those who didn't enjoy it. I'm sorry you were all let down, and hopefully you didn't lose all your faith in the DC Cinematic Universe. I believe that Suicide Squad earns a8/10!This review is brought to you by Boogie Buddha, and remember, don't just get down, but get Boogie. Thank you for reading and or viewing, and I hope you all have an amazing day as always. ""Stay evil doll face."" :)",Suicide Squad,1386697
32,FlashCallahan,"Batsy, Batsy, Batsy..........",10/10,5 August 2016,"There have been films that have been divisive for all the right reasons. Last year, The Visit split audiences and critics alike right down the middle into the quality of the film. But there were the people whom already gave the film the brush of because of the director.Now we have Suicide Squad, and it's pretty much the same for this film, but because of some people's views of BVS, many have already dismissed this because it's D.C., and nothing can touch Marvel, or the legacy Ledger left with his portrayal.Haters gonna hate......a team of incarcerated villains, including Harley Quinn, Killer Croc, and Deadshot, are recruited by the government for a suicide mission in exchange for clemency. Their assignment, however, is complicated by the ongoing quest of the Joker to reunite with his one true love......I'll get straight to the point. The film is stupendously entertaining, it's bright, colourful, devoid of any sort of relevant story, put goes along at such a heady pace, full of wonderful characters, couldn't care less. This is Suicide Squad, The Con Air of comic book movies.The film is split into three. The first part is the back stories and introductions to the squad, and they are each unique to their characters, but do give a little away to how their individuality will affect their actions. Smith for example is easily the most humanistic of the titular group, and it's no surprise as to how his character progresses through the film. Dead shot is a contract killer, not a psychotic killer, thief, or your atypical 'bad guy'. He has a daughter for crying out loud, that should spell everything out.Harley Quinn is good, but she runs out of steam toward the end of the third act. She's amazing to look at, but her little tics and one liners start to grate toward the end, but her story with The Joker is ironically the most interesting thing of the first act.The rest of the characters introductions are a lot shorter bar Enchantress, which has a The Decent vibe to it, but you never get bored of the introductions, eve if it does take a good 30mins of the film up.The second act is heavily influenced by Carpenters Escape From New York, it's them in a desolate place, with their lives at stake, and what pretty much feels like a no win situation, just lake Snake Plisskin had all them years ago. This is where the bad guys and the good guys start to get a little bit of a mutual respect for each other, thanks to the relationship between Smith and Kinnerman, their banter is excellent, and the second act is as action packed and as funny as you'd expect, with The Jokers shadow hanging heavily over the narrative.The third act is very reminiscent of the final act of the original Ghostbusters, and this is where the majority of the Squad come into their own, especially Diablo, played brilliantly by Hernandez.And for once, the trailers haven't given anything about the narrative away, the actual story, as flimsy as it is is pretty surprising, as I thought it was centred around Leto's Joker.Leto, is honestly wonderful as the Joker, and although his screen time is limited, it's the characters shadow that keeps him in the back of your mind for the film.Courtney doesn't do much as Boomerang other than drink beer and play with his unicorn, and the inclusion of Katana is a pointless exercise.But all in all, it's a wonderful creation, frenetic, funny, scary, and well justified of its 15 rating here in the U.K.Ignore the critics and the haters, Suicide Squad, while light on plot, is top notch summer entertainment, and one of the most enjoyable things D.C has released yet.Like Smith said to Viola Davis (who is the scariest thing in the film) 'that's gangster'.......",Suicide Squad,1386697
33,dom_ti2000,Hollywood tricked us again,1/10,14 August 2016,"After sitting in the theater, about 30 minutes into the movie, i asked myself: ""Why the hell did this pile of vomit make it to the big screen? Why did I pay full price for this straight to DVD shoot-em-up fest?, why do I like that deranged blonde so much?"". Plot of the movie: Get a bunch of deranged psychotic freaks to team up, shoot a bunch of generic freaks to get another big freak to stand in a corner so the humans blow it up with a generic bomb, that is the whole movie right there.Congrats to the marketing team behind this movie, getting so much people to watch this garbage is a big accomplishment.I imagine I would have enjoyed this movie if I was drunk as a skunk or high as a kite.

34,SnoopyStyle,actually OK with lots of annoying little problems,6/10,26 December 2016,"Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) recruits various criminals from a black site in Louisiana to battle the new unprecedented dangers. June Moone (Cara Delevingne) is an archaeologist who got possessed by a witch named Enchantress. Special forces Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman) fell in love with her and leads the group. Floyd Lawton (Will Smith) is assassin Deadshot who can't miss. The most important thing in his life is his daughter. George Harkness (Jai Courtney) is Captain Boomerang. Chato Santana is El Diablo but he has turned pacifist. Waylon Jones is Killer Croc. Tatsu Yamashiro is Katana with a soul stealing sword. There is Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), the psycho love of The Joker (Jared Leto). A powerful danger is unleashed in Midway City and the group is called.This was critically panned by the majority. I expected more of a mess. The story is simple and easy to follow. No doubt, there are some jarring edits with some disjointed flow. It's a little bothersome but it doesn't make it incomprehensible. The movie just keeps hitting speed bumps with annoying little problems. What's with Enchantress' movements? Her whole character is problematic. Why would Harley Quinn go back? Why would Waller kill everyone? There are varying problems in the writing. On the positive side, these are interesting characters well played by skilled actors. Will Smith, Margot Robbie, and Jared Leto are standouts. Joker and Harley Quinn have a great story together. If anything, this shows potential for these characters into the future.",Suicide Squad,1386697
35,coreyjdenford,Welcome to the Injustice League,4/10,5 August 2016,"This is my review for Suicide Squad (spoiler free)****(4/5) A lot of people said that End of Watch (2013) writer/director David Ayer was crazy but nobody thought he was this crazy but here it is the craziest superhero/villain movie in existence. Which is a strong and stern addition to the DCEU, and it doesn't take itself too seriously unlike BvS which pretty much just had special effects pizazz to get it's point across, and didn't have any funny dialogue unlike this. Even though in some areas the dialogue is a bit bumpy and could have been better but all is forgiven. Because from the trailer which was released earlier this year and is one of the most viewed trailers on Youtube for movies 2016, it showed that this blockbuster is going to brilliantly bonkers and it is but not too bonkers it still has some serious bits. Which is better than BvS which made people feel more fatigued than there were enjoying it. But enough about that.The story is somewhat okay in this, you can tell it's there but it does fall flat for a few instances and alongside the plot it has the craziness that this Machiavellian crew all have in common. But with the editing it's a little faster due to the executive producer Zach Snyder it's a little darker than normal but that's not to say that, that is a bad thing it just makes the film a bit more serious which is one thing the Suicide Squad shouldn't be especially because in the comics the characters were all nuts, with the insane Harley Quinn as the leader. The characters in this are amazing you can tell that they are taken straight out of the comic book, even with Jared Leto's Joker who isn't part of the Suicide Squad comics just shows to be a formidable force along with the ride. His Joker is brilliant but lacks on thing and that is the purple attire the Joker is famous for but he does rock the 'Damaged' tattoos, also he lacks the insanity of previous Jokers but that's not his fault he still adds a certain efficiency to the story, and at some points makes it better.But the show-runner is Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn who looks astonishing in the characters skimpy clothes, and she certainly shows the craziness of the real Harley Quinn straight out of the comic and her one-liners are just hysterical, and one of a kind. However when it comes to the action they all have their special trademark attacks but the one that shows strongest is Will Smith's Deadshot proving to be a better shooter than we last lead to believe he keeps the team strong even when some (Harley Quinn) have their crazy moments. Aside from all the fast-paced action which is amazing by the way it has very good special effects which look absolutely astonishing to match with the purple and green title screen and well it certainly is a strong point of the film. Also one quick thing to add Viola Davis nails her part as secretary Amanda Waller.But on the low side it lacks the origin stories of the characters, the stories are there but they aren't as prominent as I'd hoped, and also they don't last too long and also it looks like the film just cares about the two crazy mains, who are funny which proves that David Ayer can do comedy but it looks like they take the lead way too, the other characters do make an impact though they're left standing like statues. In conclusion even without the stories this is a strong and stern addition to the DCEU and will go down in history as one of the craziest but great DC films. And certainly is better looking and makes you show your sense of humor which is one thing that Zach Snyder lacks.Verdict: A brilliantly bonkers addition to the DCEU filled with enigmatic action and crazy parts that will make even the calmest mind go crazy. Welcome to the Injustice League.8/10 full of energy and action.",Suicide Squad,1386697
36,vovietanh,Nothing makes sense at all. I repeat. NO. THING.,1/10,14 August 2016,"Awful direction and writing. This movie is plagued with awkward and anticlimactic scenes. Seriously, can David Ayer suck less?Making a movie about illogical people is no excuse to deprive it of ANY LOGIC at all. Some highlights:First, the main characters are completely unlikeable. Flag and Waller act like condescending scumbags all the time. Waller is worse. She's like begging to be hated in every single scene. Why would David try so hard to make people hate a black woman??The whole disaster of the movie that the Suicide Squad had to fix was caused one of their members the Enchantress. If Project X that forms the Suicide Squad were not created in the first place, then there'd be no such disaster!When Waller found out Enchantress betrayed, she stabbed its heart multiple times, but didn't destroy it at all (!!) so that Enchantress could retrieve it later effortlessly and revive. If Waller simply destroyed that heart, the movie wouldn't happen.Enchantress caused the disaster by releasing her brother, an almighty being that could wipe out the whole city, even the world. However, ever since she was released by June Moore, she had plenty of chances to do that because she could instantly teleport to anywhere. There was no reason for her to wait until she was almost killed to launch that evil plan. That means she's one of the strongest but also dumbest creatures on Earth.Harley Quinn proved her love to Joker by plunging into tanks of chemical toxic from at least the 5th floor, and was supposed to be dead, but then was magically resuscitated by just one kiss.There was no character development and some characters were treated like trash. Slipknot as a Suicide Squad member appeared just to be killed disgracefully right at the beginning. Boomerang is also an insignificant character because the movie wouldn't change at all with or without him.Joker heroically appeared to save Harley Quinn just to be shot down immediately. Isn't he smart??Enchantress's brother, a Godlike being who devastated a whole city, was killed in an instant with a bomb that barely punched a hole on the ground.Almost all scenes with Waller were unpalatable, awkward, and anticlimactic, especially the ending where the final boss was defeated. Can David Ayer make the lasting moment of his movies suck less??Overall, I can't stand this state of plummeting movie standards anymore. I would vote a 1 and encourage everyone not to see it.",Suicide Squad,1386697
37,bubbabubbalicious,So Bad Even Shills Can't Ensure The Truth Won't Get Out,1/10,14 August 2016,"Suicide Squad is a tedious movie. I saw this last night and I've tried to forget it ever since. From the get go, the Suicide Squad anti-heroes are introduced one- by-one. Then, once they're all given their backgrounds and clichéd introductions, they are delivered to their new boss, one . . . by . . . one. This consumes about the first 45 minutes, just before the meaningless action takes place. What's really ironic, More time is spent describing their ironic natures than explaining their first mission. Consequently, their first foray just seems pointless, because it is. The character development was weak and I really didn't care if they came back alive or not.HACK: In a fiction-writing context, the term is used to describe writers who are paid to churn out sensational, lower-quality ""pulp"" fiction such as ""true crime"" novels or action centered ""super hero movies"".Batman Begins (screenplay/director: Christopher Nolan) is a study in character development. Suicide Squad (David Ayer writer/director) is a hack job if there ever was one. And yet it has a 6.9 as I write this, so I see shills at work. Time will water this ""dog"" to it's real valuation, about 4.7 is my guess. I gave it a 1/10 because it's was insultingly bad. PS - Will Smith is interesting as usual, but not nearly enough to recommend this. This movie is a study in rote-cliché, predictable and plodding screenplay development, and extremely poor dialogue. Dead Pool is SO much better, that is if you want to laugh at super heroes.",Suicide Squad,1386697
38,Jazzy31133,Snatches Defeat from the Jaws of Victory,6/10,28 November 2016,"I think the IMDb user rating of 6.5 perfectly encapsulates what to expect. I use the site mainly to calibrate my expectations before watching a blockbuster or decide to invest my time in giving an indie feature a chance.Suicide Squad has such star power and superhero connections that I was going to watch it no matter what the user reviews said (I always disregard critic reviews as they rarely are helpful) and feel like many viewers were going to as well.The movie has cool set pieces, action scenes and fantastic costumes. However, the plot is so muddled and choppy it detracts from the viewing experience. Another weak link is the enemy - no real backstory to draw us in, almost no explanation on what the enemy is building, and almost laughable minions for the ""heroes"" to combat.There are so many cool characters, I think the movie and plot would have been better served if this had been Part I of a series, rather a stand alone movie.I read an article that stated David Ayer only had six weeks to put a script together and it unfortunately it shows. I felt like I was watching a long trailer - cool and fun scenes that were disconnected from each other.I certainly won't say to pass on this, especially comic book fans, but be warned it is a let down. Especially, considering the awesome source material the director had to work with.",Suicide Squad,1386697

Only seen a few times and back when I originally saw in theater I wasn't reviewing yet. I very much understand the hate in my opinion a better version would be R rated like James Gunn did soon to release among other stuff that don't matter as much because more importantly the entertainment value exceeded my expectations! I absolutely love the soundtrack, some of the dialogue is delightful, and the fun is just what I'd want.

View on the film:Gathering up a group of Punk outcasts,the screenplay by writer/director David Ayer pulls the strings down on the unique elements of each Squad member,to instead trap them in a vague race against time adventure,with the bare minimum of Comic-Book pulp.With the studio not building a background to the Squad in solo flicks,Ayer spends the opening on the origins back to back,which ends up making them each just feel like another cog in the franchise.Whilst the soundtracks strays on the misjudged,director Ayer & cinematographer Roman Vasyanov display the pulp comic/animated roots of the characters in an eye-catching fashion of grubby spandex,from Harley Quinn's naughty,but nice suggestive costume,to the mighty roar of Killer Croc.Extensively re-filmed, Ayer makes the production issues all too visible,as would-be action set-pieces are covered in a dark blue which adds to the vagueness of the mission,and saturated coloured flashbacks are randomly chucked in,that feel like a last ditch shot at giving the gang members some background.Going ""method"" for the movie, Jared Leto makes his Joker be a street ""gangsta"",whose silver gums and tattoos are symbols of his street cred,and not a psychological component to the character.Joined by a welcomed,wise-cracking Will Smith as Deadshot, sexy Margot Robbie steals the movie with a baseball bat attack as Harley Quinn,with Robbie tangling the dangerously playful Punk wild card edge of Quinn,with an underlying,quick-witted side of making sure the Suicide Squad don't join the suicide club.",Suicide Squad,1386697
42,Mr-Fusion,"I didn't heed the warnings, and I wish I did.",2/10,13 June 2018,"They say that most of Jared Leto's scenes were left on the cutting-room floor. That's the good news. And that's as humorous as I can be about this. You don't have to be a fanboy to see that the approach was all wrong; to the characters, the tone, even the soundtrack. I don't want to throw gas on the fire here, but the quicker I can forget about this Hot Topic DC movie, the better.It's godawful.

43,keving4241,As a fan of 1987 Suicide Squad comics I was pleased,8/10,5 August 2016,"First off, this can't be looked at in comparison to The Dark Knight because these are two very different stories in the Gotham Universe. People going into this with that mindset might be disappointed. I know this was more based off the 2011 Suicide Squad comics which I don't mind. I found it odd Deadshot got the spotlight as more of a ""main character"" type. It was something I could dislike easily because she's usually quiet and menacing in the background. Will Smith ended up playing a great Deadshot. As much as I love Harley, Joker steals the show. I love the classic cartoon Joker and he played it brilliantly.There's some good character development and the writing was more funny than I expected but DC is just so dark all the time I felt like it enhanced it. It's funny but in a dark twisted way in the comics. If I had to say some negatives... I don't like the shaky-cam action fight that are way too zoomed in to see anything. It was tolerable and there were some great action movie moments. However because they had character development, it allows the audience to care more about the fights/action. You can have a good character piece with bad action cause at least you care about what's going on. Bad writing or bad character presentation with great action will not get the crowd to have a reaction. But I wouldn't go as far as calling it bad. However the editing was terrible. I heard they took this movie into a focus group who knew nothing about movies or proper story structure for that matter and let them dictate what happened to it. David Ayer did a great job, don't ruin his work through editing. I'm reviewing this based off what I saw in his original idea. The movie would get a 9 if they didn't change it.I can't really judge it on a typical movie goer scale because I go to see the comic book movies for a reason. When they get it right, it's gold. I don't mind a few changes if they positively affect the overall outcome. This movie succeeded with that. I'd highly recommend to comic fans.",Suicide Squad,1386697
44,wazzic,EXTENDED version SAVES the movie!!!,9/10,15 November 2016,"Much like the success of the Batman v Superman EXTENDED version, the re-release of Suicide Squad is a sure-footed, spectacular story. It is more visually transfixing, increasingly good, and an evolutionary step forward in storytelling. Everything critics complained about the Joker is fixed as all his deleted scenes now included. More humor and character background restlessly are added amid the high-flying action. Katana initially seemed to unnecessary added, but now she has more backstory and her sword plays a bigger role in the climax. There are more Batman scenes with Killer Croc and Harley Quinn. The fifteen minutes added to the Joker and Harley Quinn subplot brings a new light to their relationship and their three-way conflict with Batman. This is the brilliantly clever movie that should have been released in the first place. DC's extended releases are redemption to the studio cuts. This is the winning movie fans were hoping to see.

45,amirjonis,Don't bother -- it's a mess.,3/10,5 August 2016,"Flat jokes, one-liners and terrible chemistry make up this movie. As usual, we see a group of heroes taking on a legion of mindless alien/zombie/no-named soldiers who have absolutely no chance. There are so many awkward moments in this movie. You don't have to see the movie to know how it will play out and end. The bad guy is lame and uninteresting, who apparently has the power to instantly disarm all of the heroes but doesn't use it until the very end -- when it's too late. I get that they want to show us that she is ""powerful"", but they just don't know what they are doing. Just terrible.Save your time and money. There are few memorable things about this movie.",Suicide Squad,1386697
46,sinatrakennedy,A beautiful mess,8/10,5 August 2016,"First off, the movie is beautiful to look at and the squad is awesome. The way they are introduced is awesome. The music is perfect. The pace is a bit off at times and the jokers scenes feel rushed and choppy. He's never on screen long enough to get immersed in his character. This feels like editing issues after the fact. Harley Quinn is awesome, and Deadshot is perfect. The movie would have been amazing if it focused on the Joker as its villain but sadly it chooses to have a CGI Saturday morning cartoon villain instead (truly the films weakest link). It's easy to see why the critics are bashing SQ. it feels forced and rushed. As if the camera is afraid to give any one character too much screen time. Killer Croc is visually great but has the worst lines to say (his one liners fall flat). Boomerang is great. That's all I'm going to say because I enjoyed the movie. It's a mess, it's kind of like making a bacon lettuce tomato sandwich and at the last minute you realize you are out of mayo. It's still great but it's missing an important ingredient and in this case, a worthy villain of such a worthy Squad. I wanted More. For the record, I carry a torch for Batman V Superman and thought the rated R version of that film was AMAZING.",Suicide Squad,1386697
47,disdressed12,boring,3/10,30 August 2016,"what a disappointment this movie was.i found it boring slow and uninteresting.i struggled to stay awake and debated leaving part way through.Margot Robbie was the best(and only)good thing in the whole movie.there were quite a few good actors here,but nobody can save this thing.and***minor spoiler coming right up***the Joker has very little screen time,which is a shame,because if the character had more screen time,it might have elevated the movie.as it is i wouldn't recommend the movie to anyone.but if you do decide to go see it,you might want to go in with low expectations.for me,Suicide Squad was a real disappointment.i give Suicide Squad a 3/10.

49,Johnny_West,Freak Show of Bad Acting,2/10,11 January 2022,"Not really an action movie, more like a carnival freak show. Put together all these oddball characters that are basically freaks, not superheroes, and you get a freaky movie.The fact that all the actors are also big stars with big egos had to make it even harder to end up with anything that resembled a good movie. It was just a gigantic explosion of everyone doing whatever they wanted to do, having fun making a bad movie.

50,barbagvido,"Ignore the critics. If you're interested at least one bit, go see it You won't regret it.",8/10,5 August 2016,"My expectations were very high and this was my most anticipated movie of the year. I've been waiting for it for more than a year. And now it's finally here. And it was well worth the wait.Some critics call it worse than Green Lantern and last year's Fantastic Four. Well, that's where critics become haters because any person who says that is crazier than Harley Quinn. This movie ISN'T that bad. In fact, if you're a fan, you will love it. If you don't know much about the source material or DC Comics in general, the least you will think is that it was fun. Think Guardians of the Galaxy, DC version. Without space or aliens. And it's got an awesome soundtrack too. The critics say both that the plot is thin and that it's overstuffed. Just there you can see that they are just nitpicking. I'll be honest, the plot IS thin, but like the plot of The Avengers isn't. And yet, no one mentioned that. And it's still a good movie (to me not as good as everyone says, but okay). And this is even better. At least it is to me. It kinda depends if you like DC or Marvel more. But still, if you prefer Marvel, you will think this was at the very least entertaining. There were clearly some disagreements between the director and the studio because the studio wanted a more light-hearted and funnier movie, while Ayer wanted it to be darker and it isn't very well balanced and that's the reason why the movie feels choppy at times. The first half is full of dark humor and while there is some over- exposition, it sets up the characters very well. The second half is a bit more serious, but that was necessary to add some more emotional weight to everything. Maybe it does seem gloomy at times (I was, honestly, never bothered by that because that's what DC is and I don't see why everyone has a problem with that), but even tho I liked Man of Steel and Batman v Superman, I will admit and say that this movie has something those two movies didn't have. The appeal. And the main reason for that is the best thing about the movie:the characters. They are well written (a few of them are kinda paper thin, let's take Killer Croc for example) and every actor nailed the role he or she played. And by the way, don't expect to see much of The Joker. Leto killed it and he captivates every time he's on screen, but he's on screen for probably 10 minutes in total. But even tho everyone was great in their roles, the biggest star of the movie is Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn. I just couldn't write this review without mentioning her. I can't wait to see more of her and Leto. And also Jai Courtney as Captain Boomeramg nailed it. If you didn't like him before, you will still like him here, trust me. Also, if you were worried about the PG-13 rating, stop worrying. When you see the movie, you will see that it didn't even need an R rating. R rating would probably just make it look kinda pretentious.Basically, if you're interested, go see it and ignore the critics. This is the best DCEU movie yet and if you're a fan, it's guaranteed that you'll love it!",Suicide Squad,1386697
51,doggonegood44,"problems, but overall enjoyed it",7/10,8 August 2016,"Y'know I didn't hate this like everyone in the world seems to. The characters were colorful, big. I guess it's a tough task to get them all equal screen time. My suggestion would have been to cut back on the members. Problem solved.It doesn't quite have the fun of the trailer, which can happen when someone not involved with film cuts something that may not represent the film.Harley Quinn obviously a stand out, but the BIG ONE for me, was seeing Batman, albeit briefly. Just enough to tantalize. Wetted my appetite for his solo film which can't come soon enough.

What is all the fuss about? How good this movie is and where it fits in the DC Universe? I have no clue, nor did I enjoy this endless fighting, no plot, no sense, but pure twaddle.

53,SpookyJackie,Entertaining and enjoyable despite some flaws!,8/10,4 August 2016,"For starters, I am both a Marvel and DC fan, but I'll admit that DCU movies have not been that good lately when compared to MCU movies. Nonetheless, I found this movie entertaining and enjoyable. I found movies like Man of Steel just ""okay"" and Batman V. Superman was over decent; still, I was still hyped for the Suicide Squad and was excited to see what they would offer.Every movie has its flaws, and I tried my best to stay away from reading reviews before watching this movie. Your best bet is to just go in blind and not hold any expectations and see how this movie will affect you. I was excited because of their direction with a DC movie that has a cast of all villains/anti-heroes, but I was also a little skeptical seeing how DC movies have been a bit lacking lately. I really liked this movie, of course it has its cons like any other film. I love all the characters, the action was fun to watch, and it made me laugh several times throughout the movie. My biggest issue with the Suicide Squad was mainly about how they chose to focus on the characters. Some characters got a lot more screen time and had occasions where their background was explored a little more deeply, while some characters didn't get that much time or focus. Realistically, the cast was large so it would be more confusing and overbearing if they took too much time with each character. (That's also a double-edged sword though, in my opinion). I wish they would have given more screen time or backstory to the other characters, as I really loved Boomerang and Katana, but they didn't have much of an opportunity to be explored more. You do get a good amount of Harley Quinn and Deadshot, which is nothing to complain about as they're also both great characters.Overall, pretty good movie. It was entertaining and enjoyable, and I love all the characters. I wished they would give more time to other members of the squad instead of focusing on just a few too much. Some action scenes felt satisfying while some felt just mediocre. A tip would be to try and not hold any expectations or have your mind be painted by critics or other viewers, go see it and decide yourself! Despite some minor flaws here and there, you'll find an entertaining summer movie.",Suicide Squad,1386697
54,npocmaka,Awful,1/10,20 August 2016,"If you want to enjoy this do not ask logical questions. Of course if I wanted a documentary movie , but logical inconsistencies here are too much...How a camera mounted on boomerang would not flip?How the boomerang was capable to hover?Why the enchantress didn't took the Amanda Waller's phone and killed the whole suicide squad?How the El Diablo didn't triggered the explosive when he went full fire?How the explosive was capable to kill the 'brother' but combination of fire, bullets and katana cuts was not? Explosion didn't look so powerful...Why at her final appearance Amanda Waller had her fingers on the touch screen of her phone and this didn't kill anyone? Who gave Harley a cell phone? And did't spy her communication at least? This could save few marine's life and a helicopter.Why Deadshot,Boomerang,Slipknot,Harley Quinn (and even Katana) were considered as meta humans?Why Amanda took the helicopter as it was the helicopter? There was no helicopter operational more than 2 minutes , before it was took down.Does the enchantress has two hearts at the end? How nobody recognized her brother's statue as a dangerous thing? Was his heart hidden somewhere? And what kind of archaeologist was June? She brook the potential precious artifact?And she was alone in the jungle?Why Slipknot was not present in the initial intro of the 'metahumans'. He came out of nowhere and died stupidly.How the squad attached so fast to each other? Especially the boomerang who killed his biddy during the robbery.And even a simple pistol is a superior weapon than this stupid boomerangs.What was the point of captain boomerang , except the hovering boomerang with the camera?And the joker was a joke.

55,martinpersson97,"Didn't live up to its hype, to say the least",6/10,14 June 2023,"When a movie adaptation of the Suicide Squad comics was announced, and a pretty promising trailer was released, I must admit I was pretty hyped.The DCU was still in its craddle and hadn't had much time to disappoint much yet, and the trailer promised a fun black comedy with lots of great music and pop culture references - riding on the success of Tarantino, or Deadpool and Guardians of the Galaxy if talking about the superhero genre.And whilst it somewhat delivered in terms of that, a lot of it just feels forced. The characters are not very developed and the CGI and tone is not that impressive.It has some going for, but it was all perfected much better in its reboot/sequel from a few years later by James Gunn.This feels more like a shallow copy of other more successfull films, and generally lacks heart.Recommended in terms of following the DCU, and it's not all bad. It is probably the best of the first batch of DCU movies, though that might not be saying too much.",Suicide Squad,1386697
56,BA_Harrison,Dismal Crap.,3/10,19 November 2017,"As much as I prefer the DC universe over Marvel, those behind the movies seem unable to replicate the ingenuity and entertainment level of superhero competitors Marvel. Pretty much every movie DC have produced since the turn of the millennium has been disappointing (and yes, I do include Nolan's vastly over-rated Batman trilogy in that statement).Suicide Squad is no exception a chaotic mess of a movie that lingers in the mind for about as long as it takes the Flash to nip to the shops and back. Writer/director David Ayer clearly hopes that the novelty of a team of super-villains will be enough to carry the movie, but he's wrong: Suicide Squad is desperately in need of a creative driving force who is more concerned with telling a decent story than showcasing his cool characters and blowing his budget on an arsenal of trendy graphics and expensive CGI special effects.As far as the cast are concerned, Will Smith is adequate as Deadshot, the world's greatest hit-man, Margot Robbie's butt is great as Harley Quinn's butt, and Karen Fukuhara as Katana ably fulfils the token Asian hottie role for the overseas market, but everyone else is bland and instantly forgettable, including Jared Leto as the worst incarnation of the Joker to ever grace the silver screen. And whoever thought that the world's ugliest supermodel, Cara Delevingne, would make for an imposing villainess needs their head checked: she's dreadful.",Suicide Squad,1386697

58,akinchris84,Thanks but no thanks.,3/10,4 August 2016,"Possible spoilersI went in the movie with reservations, I heard negative reviews, I heard good ones. As always I make my own judgment afterwards.First and foremost, this is probably the worst and most over dramatized version of the Joker I have ever seen in my life. I was raised in comic books, they tried entirely too hard to make Joker look crazy. It seemed way too forced, he and Harley Quinn both look more like junkies than psychopaths. Not to mention they horribly botched the relationship of Jokers impression of Harley. I have no idea what they were aiming for and even less of an idea on why Jared Leto accepted that role. Harley Quinn, again they spent way too much time and effort making her a sex symbol and made her look like some white trash/hood rat combo with minor Harley Quinn traits.Deadshot, honestly, this was where I held most my reservations. I didn't like the idea of Will Smith in comic movies, but I think he did a fantastic job. The claim that Margot Robbie stole the screen just doesn't seem right as the movie centered more on the changes that he made as well as the leadership role he acquired.Killer Croc, I don't even know here. This was just plain bad in so many ways. I will just leave this one alone.Boomerang or whatever he was called, yet another utterly useless character I half expected to be killed off. Like the Joker in this movie he was a try hard with no real desire to see again.Katana, yes because who doesn't like having someone show up that doesn't speak a lick of English. You know the very language that the rest of the movie was in.Flag, no depth of a non-""meta human"" kinda expected more than a minimal love story.The enchantress wasn't bad when she wasn't doing some weird fish like dance moves.Plot, terrible. Outside of the focus on Deadshot the plot seriously lacked. Why would you bring Batman into a movie for parts yet he keeps himself away from a several day long battle, especially with his decision to make a team after the doomsday problem.I would have scored this movie lower if it wasn't for the occasional Harley Quinn like characteristics and the fact that Will Smith shined pretty well.Whoever wrote some of those scripts and designed the characters should be exiled from Hollywood.",Suicide Squad,1386697
59,christopherholich,Fantastic Movie!,7/10,31 July 2016,"Wow. Got out of the early screening earlier and was super surprised. First thing i want to talk about is Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn. She did an amazing job, at times it can be confusing because her voice switches from her signature Brooklyn accent to just a normal American voice but it works out perfectly. Jared Leto is great, he is a very controversial pick as the Joker but i think reactions will be mixed, I think he was fantastic though. Not enough of him either. Then there was Will Smith as Deadshot, he was more or less the main leader of the suicide squad (or the squad) Viola Davis as Amanda Waller was probably the best casting In a superhero movie since Rdj as Iron Man. She was so menacing and is such an amazing actress. Batfleck is in it for a little, you were expecting him to play into the story more, but every scene he was in the crowd was Cheering. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje plays Killer Croc, who was good, but wasn't a stand-out like I was hoping, although they didn't really put him in it to much but he was still good. Diablo was an okay character, easily has the most bad ass powers in the squad though. People Do die. I'm not going to say who, but if you watch the trailers there is a certain somebody in the squad who you assume does die... If you know who that is then you know who dies. The first 15 minutes of the movie is pretty slow. It shows all the villain's backstories. Flash interacts with Boomerang which was an Amazing scene. The flash is awesome so hyped for Justice Leauge. All in all this movie had enough Comedy and Action to blend in to an amazing summer movie. I won't compare it to Bvs Or Captain America because it isn't fair, they are all good in there own way. I highly recommend it. Go see this movie in theaters August 5th and buy it on DVD when it comes out. It's highly worth your time.",Suicide Squad,1386697
60,FabledGentleman,"Margot Robbie shines. Rest of the film, not so much.",3/10,3 August 2016,"*sigh* Two words that describe this film. Missed opportunities.This movie should never have been made for PG-13, but R rating. But because it has been made for kids, this movie, and all that it could have achieved, is a huge wasted opportunity of gigantic proportions. Marvel was also hesitant to make Deadpool with R-rating, but they finally did, and it payed off.I hate all the mistakes DC are making these days. I grew up with batman and superman comics in the 80's and 90's, so it hurts when i see them treat their own material this way.Margot Robbie is the star of this film, she steals all the attention in every scene she is in, and i can not but imagine what she could have done with this character if it was not a movie for kids. A huge contrast to the rest of the cast assemble which has too little to do, and they are to many, so we don't ever get to like or dislike any of them. To top it off, the joker has far to few scenes in this film, which is a shame. Jared Leto plays a solid mad joker.And as i predicted before the movie came out, was that David Ayer would yet again fail. He and Fuqua both, are riding on the success they had with ""Training Day"", and IMO none of them have directed a good movie since then. Ayer is not a good story teller, he is good at blending action with CGI, which this movie could of had a lot less and rather spend time on the story. His direction, combined with a weak story, and combined with PG-13, disaster happens.And this is a movie that was so hyped as well. This was the one film DC had to do right, to prove they had it in them. The Marvel movie that kind of compare to this is ""Guardians of the galaxy"". And what Marvel did right was to give all the characters a unique and special personality, making it easier to recognize and care for them, which then made it a good movie. Here in ""Suicide squad"" we just have an outstanding Margot Robbie with a bunch of ""others"". Which is a damn shame.I heard before i saw the film that a lot of the Jokers scenes were cut out of the film before the final cut, i haven't read more into it. But The Joker had way to few scenes in this film, maybe the other scenes they had to remove weren't PG-13 friendly.*sigh* Why DC?. WHY?Is it so damn hard to make a R rated movie now and then? With an R rating, this movie would have dared to be as violent as it has to be with this assemble of anti heroes. The Joker can go full ballistic, Harley Quinn can be even more daring, The language even more naughty and provoking. It is all the movie needed to be decent or even good. But DC didn't have the brass balls needed to pull it off.Therefor just a big pile of missed opportunities.4/10 - Very Disappointing",Suicide Squad,1386697
61,npfares,A horrible Mess,1/10,24 August 2018,"I honestly don't get it. I really don't. Where are all the high ratings coming from? Is it from 12 year old boys who say 'oooooo, look I saw Margot Robbie with her shirt off and saw her bra.'? Maybe trolls who don't care about content but just want 'action, action, action' because it's the only movie they see this year, and 'oh by the way, I saw Margot Robbie with her shirt off. HeHe'? There was hardly any character development, the characters portrayed in this movie didn't really reflect their characters in the comics, The Joker was portrayed as some type of Rapper type gangster (which isn't the character. The Joker isn't a white Rapper wannabe Gangster. He is a seriously disturbed character who has very serious mental health issues who people can say 'in a certain twisted way yeah! I get the logic'). Will Smith plays too much of a 'nice guy' type of character in which his character wasn't really that 'nice of a guy'. On top of that we find Margot Robbie playing Harley Quinn. A Character that is suppose to be unrealisticly 'in love' with the Joker. But all we get is 'oh, how cute! They have a misunderstood love that the public doesn't understand' type of character arch. Really people? How did this movie even make it's money back!?",Suicide Squad,1386697
62,cyrilthemusical,Suicide Squad Not Bad A they say,8/10,6 August 2016,"The movie is definitely Fun to watch! I, along with my friends enjoyed the Humour inserted all though some of the dialogues showed that they tried pushing the humour... I loved Joker, Harley Quinn, Headshot as well as El Diablo! I enjoyed the animated Killer Croc. All though I have had mixed feeling about Enchantress i still was disappointed about the enchantress's Brother being animated. Also pushing deadshot as thinking about his Daughter was definitely not working for me or any of my friends... I am happy about seeing Batman. The movie was of great pace.... the action sequence was fun! I enjoyed so many things. David Ayer definitely made the Dark DC theme very appealing!! The dancing fire in El diablo was so cool!! i definitely Love the movie so did my friends! Its not a super awesome movie, but definitely a treat for the eyes!

63,TheOneThatYouWanted,Boycott Wonder Woman and they'll reboot the DCU,3/10,30 August 2016,"This film is a mess. Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn was great. And Will Smith brought his A-Game. But almost everything else about the film is boring, lame and OMG WHY DID I PAY MONEY TO WATCH THIS? I could go on but you heard it all before. So let us talk about the Joker. Fanboys are giving Jared Leto's Joker a pass by saying we didn't see enough of him to judge him. Ummm, did they watch the same movie as me? The Joker had more lines then Wonder Woman in BvS. We saw him interact with Harley, some thug, Harley a few more times and some other guy. We got to see Leto's Joker. And spoiler alert, it sucks. Leto's Joker reminded me of those Jokers you see in a fan- made YouTube video. Basically, he is generic as hell. So yeah, this current DC cinematic universe killed off the Joker. If you fools want to continue pretending like the DCU is anything but below average then you can go right ahead. I gave them 3 honest chances. I will not be spending a DIME on anything to come out from Warner Bros (DC films or otherwise) until they come to their senses and REBOOT THE DCU.",Suicide Squad,1386697
64,CriticalOfEverything,An absolute laughing stock.,1/10,22 October 2018,"Suicide Squad is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is one of the worst superhero movies I have ever seen. It is one of the worst ANYTHINGS I have ever seen. The acting is atrocious, apart from Will Smith playing Deadshot. Margot Robbie and Jared Leto both stick out to me with how bad they are. These have to be the worst incarnations of The Joker and Harley Quinn ever put to screen. Margot is just straight up annoying and is only in there for sex appeal, and Jared's acting is absolutely horrible. Every other actor leans on bad or average. The characters are all idiots and are completely one dimensional. The storyline is so unbearably stupid and is riddled with plot holes and the overall editing and effects are god awful. The fight scenes in The Amazing Spider-Man look better than any of the scenes in this movie. This movie was only made for fan-service. They did not give two craps about the quality of this absolute disaster. And somehow, against all the odds, this movie got an Oscar......HOW??? If that doesn't prove how meaningless Oscars are, then I don't know what will. Screw this movie.

66,Teymur4,Worst movie ever.,1/10,26 April 2021,"I watched Suicide Squad (2016) and it was the worst movie I have ever seen. There were jokes every 2 seconds which weren't even funny I chuckled at 2 of them. For the whole movie we don't know the villains motives. The Joker and Harley Quinn actually have a stable relationship which the whole point of there relationship is Joker is supposed to not care for Harley and just use her. 1 character was just used to be killed off and 2 other characters were there for no reason the contributed nothing. This one character was not interesting but was there for most of the movie. Jared Leto's Joker performance is really weird and stupid. Most of the movie is boring. The only good part was all the songs put in it. The movie is all around crap, worst movie ever. I rate it 0.5/10.

67,SteveResin,Flawed But Not Without Merit,7/10,4 December 2016,"After reading so many disappointing reviews since its release I watched Suicide Squad with some trepidation, but it wasn't anywhere near as bad as I expected. It's above average, but there's no denying it's flawed and parts of it just don't work at all.Similar to Sin City it's very meta in its approach. It plays up the comic book aesthetic and for me this worked well. It's quite dark with splashes of bright colour that reinforces the Sin City vibe and it looks great.OK, the good - The cast are mostly excellent, particularly Margot Robbie, Viola Davis, Joel Kinnaman and Jay Hernandez. There's a few neat appearances from Affleck as Batman and a short cameo from The Flash which was fun. Will Smith is decent as Deadshot, but his casting took me out of the movie constantly. I always felt I wasn't watching Deadshot, just Will Smith. I found it hard to separate the actor from the character, maybe they should have gone for a less iconic actor in the role. His acting is flawless though. Margot Robbie is flawless too, but I must say the constant gratuitous shots of her backside were over the top. The character was completely sexualized and if they'd reigned this in a little (or a lot if I'm honest) her character could have really been something amazing. It's a little tough to admire her acting chops or the dialogue she's been given when her backside gets top billing. Horny young teens will love it though...Sadly there's a lot of bad. The choice of music is either hugely predictable and tired (Spirit In The Sky anyone?) or just awful. The storyline is wafer thin and the big bad, an ancient and powerful witch called Enchantress has zero backstory which removes any sense of urgency to the threat everyone's up against. Her relationship with Kinnaman is also underdeveloped so why should I care, frankly? The Deadshot and his daughter scenes are largely awful and feel out of place, some of the dialogue is poor and the climactic big fight scene fell short.The most polarizing part of the movie is Jared Leto as The Joker. I've always admired Leto as an actor, he's done some incredible work in the past and had a thankless task following in Heath Ledger's much loved footsteps, but I have to be honest and say it didn't really work for me. He's more like some meth-crazed gangster than The Joker, again his back story with Harley was too short and underdeveloped and his dialogue is largely appalling. I thought Harley had more chemistry with Diablo, which says it all.I rated it a 7. If you can ignore the flaws there's an enjoyable film to be found here, not a classic by any means but certainly has it's moments.",Suicide Squad,1386697
68,nasifonline,This is a total disgrace to the DC Villains,2/10,26 August 2016,"The whole plot of the movie was a mess. It really confused me what all the characters in the film was fighting for, I mean there was no real goal of the movie for the first 70% of the time. Then they set up the story in a way where the friend turns into the foe, and those friends are now facing this foe as their primary enemy and not the one it was shown at the beginning of the movie. I think the whole script was written by a total non professional guy who needs to again go through the basic levels of a film school. This movie made DC lose its fame towards its fans and I hope they bounce back in their next show. Thank you

69,miarrigo,Disappointing and messy :(,3/10,4 August 2016,"I was really looking forward to this movie and only ended up with a huge deception. The script is messy and there are way too many characters that are too quickly introduced. Many of these ""villains"" would require a whole movie to give intensity to their character... I really feel like DC just wanted to have as big an audience as possible without spending a penny on the script. Some good things are the special effects , the movie is overall very beautiful to watch. Some characters need a bravo for their wonderful roles: Harley Quinn mostly... The others are kind of empty to me. And some are very very bad like enchantress who mumbles in a foreign language all along and whose only 3 lines in English SUCK (when she asks Flag to destroy enchantress instead of saving her blabla). The Joker doesn't have a place in the movie, his role does not add anything to it and half of his lines are... awkward moans. El Diablo's behavior is predictable from the very beginning, Batman really wasn't necessary, Katana's few lines are desperately cheesy, etc... As a conclusion, the viewer is unable to feel a link whatsoever to any of the characters since their stories are disappointingly and quickly told. The acting of many characters does not help, whether they were just bad or the director asked them to play in that un-subtle fashion. The script is disjoint, flashbacks don't add much quality or intensity to the movie, and the ""big plot"" revealed at the end is... not much of a secret since the viewer KNOWS enchantress escaped from the hands of Waller. I feel like this is a big commercial move from DC to attract people... However, this will only disgust the people who were fans of the heroes/villains in the beginning. Money over quality",Suicide Squad,1386697
70,pkneer,I Was Worried About This Film - And I Was Right,2/10,4 August 2016,"First, I had never heard of the Suicide Squad before this film was announced, but that's not necessarily bad as I had not heard of Guardians of the Galaxy either, and that film was outstanding.I had a bad feeling about this film, so much hype normally means the studio is trying too hard to publicize it to make up for a bad film. But a buddy talked me into going, so I did. I was very disappointed to say the least.Without giving away any spoilers on plot, the characters just do not gel - no charisma between them at all. Margot was the best of the group, but even her character became irritating after a while. I found it hard to root for any of the characters in this film, good guy or bad, as it would not have mattered if every character lived or died. Each character would have a moment that was interesting, then poof, it was gone. Even Leto's performance was a ""Wow"", then ""Meh"", then confusing. What a mishmash - no flow or continuity at all.Then there is the special effects. I felt like I was watching a movie from the 90s the CGI was that bad. For an action movie with characters like this, the film gets an overwhelming failing grade on effects.For a popcorn movie, it is not completely horrible - but as a comic book movie in today's world, it was just awful - much worse than Batman v Superman.Rating is a 2/10. For this type of movie, you must have either top notch special effects or a first rate script and this film had neither. The only reason it gets a 2 is that some of the action sequences were decent, but certainly not enough to carry this film.",Suicide Squad,1386697

72,sweetboyy_99,"Not a masterpiece, but a great time!",7/10,3 August 2016,"Suicide Squad is a very hyped movie, with a lot of mixed reactions, even when there were no material at all to be shown yet. I notice how a lot of the hate was towards the new joker, played by Jared Leto. And indeed, I was also skeptical about this. He could either ruin the joker, or make it better. What did he do exactly? None of it, actually. Leto's performance in Suicide Squad as the Joker was good. He gave The Joker a new face, and in my truly honest opinion, he did it well. He tried to make it his own. Not replicate or try to live up to other actors that have been playing the joker in previous movies. Now, don't get me wrong, Jared Leto's joker is nothing against Heath Ledger's version. BUT and I say this once again; he didn't ruin it. That's really my honest opinion. He's not trying to be like Ledger, he's not trying to be something that we've seen before. He's doing something new, and I liked it. Also, for those of you who read the comics, you would actually notice that Jared's take on Joker is close to his persona in the comic book series. I actually wish that he would have had more screen time, since in the entire movie he was in maybe 20 minutes of the actual 2hr film. Now, I read about this final version, and it's said to be cut out a lot and that the director had been working on his own cut, while the studio made their own. So, I can barely wait for the Directors Cut to be coming out. Hopefully, more screen time for Leto will occur and maybe a lot better pacing.Enough talking about Leto; let's talk about the actual film itself. Critics have already been slaughtering the film, giving the film awful reviews and such- The thing is; I don't really trust critics. They are too narrow-minded, they act like they are the only one who's right. I never care about what people, especially critics say about films before I've actually watched them. Then I can look back, and see if I agree with them, based on my personal opinion and interpretation of the movie itself. I can not make you like this film. Just watch the movie yourselves, then judge the film. Many people have been throwing negative reviews on this film, without second thought and some have not even watched the film. This is the worst things about reviews by critics and reviewers on IMDb. You simply cannot trust anyone, including me. So I advise you to watch the film, go back and read my review and see if you agree. That way, you won't miss a move you might have liked. All the actors does a great job portraying their characters, even though Will Smith's performance as Deadshot was a bit meh. He was funny, though. But it just feels like Will Smith playing well, Will Smith. The flashbacks in this movie are the best scenes in my personal opinion. They give you a little more depth to the story and makes you sympathize for the characters. As a person who's watched a lot of Superheroes are good, villains are bad-movies, I thought it was refreshing that for once, the villains aren't portrayed as just pure evil. However; this film absolutely has flaws. Loads of them. But rarely any film these days is flawless. There's always going to be something that you can comment on and sometimes even get annoyed by. One thing is the pacing. This film is a chaotic mess when it comes to the pacing, confusing the viewer. Too fast, too slow, but never in between. When introducing the characters, I felt that the music was overused. Every time you met a new character, and this was in quite a short time, a new song would play. However, the soundtrack is good even though it feels a bit out of place. After the mess, called BvS, I am glad to say that this film changes a lot. It shows that DC doesn't always have to make overly serious films, but can have a little fun with it too. While I like Marvel films too, they are sometimes a little bit too cartoony, the humor can feel out of place and well let's face it, sometimes you need a superhero/villain film for adults. Visually this film is amazing in every way, the amount of detail and wonderful CGI is just pure eye candy. I loved the 3D, although it wasn't quite necessary, but hey, 3D is the standard these days for films in cinema. Overall, I do not think in my own humble and honest opinion that this move deserves the hate from the critics. Most moviegoers, people I know who have seen the film, liked it. It is not a masterpiece. Long way from that. It is not an Oscar winning film by no means. It's just a really fun film to watch and I've gotta say DC is pulling in the right direction. More work needs to be done, though and there is serious problems about this film despite it being enjoyable. Reading some interviews etc, I found that the script was very rushed. (Being finished in six weeks, not okay.) Also, while I laughed and giggled at some of the jokes, some of them felt forced and out of place. However, DC has taken a huge step and I hope they will be making more movies like this one.As a final verdict, I think this movie is worth your time and is a good watch. Don't listen to critics. Heck, don't take my word for granted either. You will love it, or hate it. That's how it works, we have different opinions and tastes. I was not disappointed and I look forward to the next installment in the DC universe.",Suicide Squad,1386697
73,isaiahwilson15,"DC shows improvement, but still disappoints with Suicide Squad",6/10,10 August 2016,"Going into 2016, Suicide Squad was actually my second most anticipated superhero movie behind only Captain America Civil War. The marketing team did an absolute superb job selling this movie through some of excellently edited trailers and an surprisingly good original soundtrack, an addition that should be considered by more studios. By the time August came around, I had reached a level of excitement almost equal to that of Guardians of The Galaxy. Unfortunately, I left the theatre disappointed, but hopeful for the future of DC films. OK, so I know my tone may seem overly negative, but let me say that I really did enjoy the film. Much like Batman V. Superman, it does not deserve the reviews it's been getting from critics. The film improves upon DC's previous outing by introducing a much more lighthearted tone, at least for the film's first half, crafting a more clear and linear story, and also featuring better character development. Suicide Squad has many of the elements of a typical summer blockbuster which can't help but make it entertaining. While it may not have met my expectations, it still proved to be another enjoyable superhero movie, and that's enough for me. However, as I previously mentioned, this film has an abundance of flaws. While I did do a good amount of nit-picking, there a couple of particular problems that can't be ignored. The first lies in Suicide Squad's villain. I'm sure I'm not the first to say it, but just about everything about the Enchantress is bad. To begin, she was mistakenly marketed as being a member of the team, which lead many (including me) to believe Monster T would be the villain! Her ""host"" or whatever June Moore adds absolutely nothing to the story. Her brother is just a big pile of confusing CGI mess. Finally, her evil plan to destroy the world is given no backstory or motivation. Suicide Squad also suffers from an editing process that structures the movie in a very unusual way that screws up the pacing as well as the overall tone of the movie, which makes a dramatic shift from lighthearted and fun to dark and gritty. Finally, there's the Joker. I thought Jared Leto did a great job creating one of the most unique Joker's that has ever been portrayed on the big screen. However, I believe there isn't enough of him in the movie to formulate a fair assessment of his performance. One thing I can criticize is his role in the movie, which I felt did not fit. The Joker is mainly just there for some flashbacks that make the mistake of cramming a movie's worth of backstory into a couple of scenes. I understand that he wasn't supposed to have a major role, but I believe the tease David Ayer did give us did not fully represent the notorious Clown Prince of Crime. Suicide Squad is full of potential, and I believe going forward, this will be a great learning opportunity for DC. It shows how to successfully market a movie, provides a glimpse of how to incorporate a more lighthearted tone without being campy, and also displays the importance of proper character development. Repeat this process and then improve upon the movie's faults, and nothing would stop me from seeing a Suicide Squad 2.",Suicide Squad,1386697
74,IPyaarCinema,Suicide squad,3/10,3 April 2021,"Review By Kamal KThe task of bringing this DC Entertainment comic book story to life is on the shoulders of writer/director David Ayer. Within the first 15 minutes, it's obvious that something is off. The film doesn't start with a killer action scene that draws you in. It gets stuck in a dull parade of flashback backstories for each of the characters.As the action scenes do come into view, none are well-shot, choreographed or out-of-this-world sci-fi crazy.Hard to believe that Steven Price, Oscar-winner for the beautifully scored Gravity is responsible for the background music that sounds like it's from the Macy's Day Parade. The pacing and editing are tolerable (John Gilroy, Nightcrawler) and neither help or hinder.U. S. Intelligence officer Amanda Waller (Viola Davis), who runs a clandestine ops org named A. R. G. U. S., is trying to lead the charge against an alien super power that is threatening her city and the world. Her strategy is to fight evil with evil by enlisting the aid of hardcore super villains who are languishing in the Belle Reve Federal Penitentiary and desperate for freedom. Says Waller: ""I've finally got the worst of the worst."" She dubs them ""Meta-Humans.""She assigns military commander Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman, Robocop) to lead the mission. He brings a Samurai warrior woman named Katana (Karen Fukuhara,) along.The criminals who will form the A-Team militia are: Deadshot (Will Smith), an assassin in solitary confinement who was captured and arrested by none other than Batman (Ben Affleck, and seeing him is a buzzkill). Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie, The Legend of Tarzan and Fury) was once a psychiatrist who had a very famous patient, The Joker (Jared Leto). She let the fiend get the better of her and she now has amazing agility, fighting powers and a bad girl attitude.Slipknot (Adam Beach, Flags of Our Fathers) is a master escape artist. Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney, Divergent) is a buffed and muscular Aussie robber. Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Pompeii) is a beast with an amphibians' face. The group is rounded out with the very enigmatic and troubled Diablo (Jay Hernandez, Bad Moms) a fire starter.Unlike the Avengers or X-Men movies, where some moviegoers will be familiar with the heroes or antiheroes, this film brings a whole new set of characters to the screen that only hardcore DC comic book readers would know. The viewer is forced to meet, greet and hear the history of each, and it's a lot to ask. What's even more challenging is that none of the Suicide Squad participants have powers that are all that magical. If they really had a lot of mojo, they wouldn't spend so much time in long drawn-out and often boring fight scenes. They'd be able to annihilate their adversaries, in seconds.Though the cast members put their hearts and souls into their performances, none of their portrayals resonate and all have done better jobs in other films or TV shows.That's a further reflection on the unimaginative direction and a feeble script that never puts them in the right light or makes their characters worth watching. Given the right material, some in the cast are fully capable of handing in Oscar-worthy performances. They've done it before.As the film grinds to its cataclysmic ending (think Ghostbusters, the new one), and the witch is casting spells and fighting the squad with all the deadliness of a Miss America contestant, the scenes become less plausible, less likable, more preposterous and mundane. It's enough to drive you crazy with contempt as you think of what might have been. This is a wasted opportunity on so many levels.",Suicide Squad,1386697

Their first mission: save the world from the apocalypse.I'm glad I didn't carry any baggage into watching the movie . I haven't read the comic books so I had no pre conceived ideas as to how this should be.I really enjoyed it .The characters are really good and you can't help but be on their side despite them being the so called bad guys.Margot Robbie is great at Harley Quinn. Jared Letto had big boots to fill in his role as joker and he just about pulls it off .Will Smith is much better than I expected as Deadshot.It also has a great soundtrack.If I had a criticism , it's the the Witch is pretty lame .

The rest is total garbage. You feel that most of the actors don't even want to be there, so although the acting is mostly good enough everything feels lifeless. I consume media for the story, this pretty much doesn't have one. It's total garbage.

My friend and I watched the Suicide Squad in the cinema, and we had a great time!Sure, the movie's not perfect, it's got flaws, and not quite as good as I expected, (I may have over-hyped it) but it's not nearly as bad as the critics were saying!Plus you can't entirely blame David Ayer, the director. After all, he was only given six weeks to write the script. Not to mention the Warner Bros, Studio have developed a bad habit at meddling with recent DC movies. (BvS? Ring any bells?) So I can't wait till I get my hands on the extended cut.Gotta hand it to the cast, by the way, and the dynamic they have off- screen is so heart-warming! They looked like they had the most fun while filming, so I'm really hoping there will be future SS projects, just to see them together again.",Suicide Squad,1386697

Couldn't understand who the hell is the enchantress' brother and his connection to her, and they barely appeared in like 1/4 of the movie, didn't care much about them. - Not enough focus on the special abilities of each member of the squad and what makes them special and different from each other. - Not enough Joker presence, but I understand he wasn't supposed to be over-present in the movie.Joker was great for me and Harley Quinn is the best in the movie.

80,Carycomic,"Blows STAR TREK BEYOND, JASON BOURNE, and GHOSTBUSTERS 2016 out of the water!",10/10,4 August 2016,"Okay; now that I've got your attention, let's get down to the nitty- gritty. For those of you who aren't overgrown fan boys and girls, this film is loosely based on a DC comic that first started publishing in the 1980's. The concept no doubt having been inspired by the enduring popularity of THE DIRTY DOZEN. But, with the reluctant recruits being modern super-villains rather than court- martialed American GI's during World War II!The plot of this movie is likewise from the 1980's. More specifically; it's loosely based on the Succubus/Incubus story arc involving the magical anti-superheroine called the Enchantress. As originally depicted in DC Comics, in the late Sixties, she was as magical as Zatanna...and yet dressed like Mrs. Peel. But, by the Seventies, that had all changed. Perhaps because non-DC readers kept confusing her with the Asgardian super-villainess of the same name over at Marvel.In short; she was the first DC do-gooder to go bad. And all before ""Crisis On Infinite Earths!""This 21st century film version goes one step further. It not only updates the character of June Moone into a former archaeologist (a la Indiana Jones). It consolidates the Silver Age origin of her character with both the post-COIE revision and La Encantadora (the Latina revamp that was created in the late Nineties)! Then, we have Jared Leto's Joker. No purple tuxedo for this dude! He's performed just the way Frank Miller depicted him in that now-classic graphic novel ""The Dark Knight Returns."" Basically, a sociopathic albino Goth who just might laugh both ways (if you catch my drift). And, as blasphemous as this might sound? I find that take on the character even scarier than Heath Leger's posthumous Oscar-winning portrayal!Other than these two alterations (plus, the Afro-Americanizing of Deadshot by having him portrayed--almost too convincingly--by Will Smith), the movie stays pretty close to the basic premise of the original comic. For the most part, however, this is a straight-up sequel to BvS: DAWN OF JUSTICE. Which, as I noted in my review for that film, was inspired by both the Frank Miller epic and the introductory ""Doomsday"" story arc in Superman's comics (in the early Nineties).Need I add that Margot Robbie practically steals the show as Harley Quinn? I thought not. Go and enjoy.",Suicide Squad,1386697

82,thebricks,One scene absolutely ruined this movie for me,1/10,18 July 2017,"Let's be honest, it was just a bad movie. Jared Leto's Joker may have been the worst ever. How do you screw this role up? He played the Joker as some scummy wannabe rapper. Unbelievable stuff. This is the sort of thing that had to come out of a corporate focus group.Much of the production, action scenes and stunts were terrible and dated. It was like watching a 90's movie. How awful is David Ayer at film making? Seriously. It's like going back in time, watching the sets in this film. It looks like one of those old Universal theme park rides from back in the day.But let's get to the one scene that just made me want to walk out. It's when Amanda Waller kills the FBI agents in the Tact Ops office. One reason I hated it is because it's classic David Ayer. He HATES authority and thinks everyone in power is working for the devil. Look at all of his movies. There's a theme. Maybe he met one dirty cop in his life. Who knows? This is how he portrays ANYONE who works for the government, as the right hand of Satan. It's juvenile.Secondly, the reaction of everyone to the massacre was one big joke. Rick Flagg is supposed to be the Boy Scout Special Ops soldier and he's rather ""oh well"" about it. Will Smith is impressed and thinks it's cool. It's messed up and contradicts the writer's development of these characters. I couldn't take it seriously anymore. I found it unbelievable that Waller could get away with that, nor could I see WHY she did it, considering the cat was out of the bag about everything, anyways! Also, wouldn't you think, ""Hey, maybe she'll do this to me very soon?""I will never see another film Ayer makes, ever again.",Suicide Squad,1386697
83,thesar-2,I Now Have Suicidal Tendencies. Thanks.,2/10,6 August 2016,"Many years ago, the characters, Jack and Karen, from TV's Will & Grace, jokingly agreed with audiences (including me) that the show should've been about them. THIS movie should've just been about Joker and Harley. Those two in a movie filled with lifeless, useless and boring characters *almost* serves as a recommendation. But, when all you have is two wonderful villains in a sea of misfires that should've been at least cool, it's too much of a letdown film to spread good word-of-mouth.And the lack of a fun time you would've had with a bunch of misfits gone good is nothing in comparison to how bad the script was. The whole movie was so far all over the place, it always felt like there was another movie with an extra hour of footage that was cut out making the overall picture a completely incomprehensible mess. Suicide Squad's own premise makes no sense whatsoever, just to begin with. After (too) many flashbacks and backstories that also continue throughout the film, a plan is hatched to use the vilest baddies to, um, uh, I guess help keep people safe? All-but midstream of the planning stages, a mission so convoluted gets the ""we won't sign on"" team ready to go fightwhatever.In one of the many subplots, a slave to the ""good-guys"" causes Man of Steel-sized havoc in a downtown city. Superheroes are mentioned, used and are actively fighting crime, and yet Never was there a thought of asking for help, nor did the actual righteous heroes even notice the city under attack or hundreds dying. Yeah, this is the same argument in the Marvel Universe, such as: In Thor's movies, where's Iron Man when he's totally needed. That's a huge hole in both Marvel and DC Universe films and I guess they just ask us to accept it. Whatever.The movie had pretty subpar special effects and nothing to view on the big screen. The actors kept trying to give emotional speeches but always strayed away from their character build-ups. And the plot holes and editing was so shoddy, it lead me to believe this wasn't the movie we were supposed to see.Again, that all said, man did I like Harley and this version of Joker. I've heard complaints about Jared Leto's take and I didn't have one problem with it. I've seen so many incarnations of him, I'm used to new visions of ""J."" From Cesar Romero's to Jack Nicholson's to my person favorite, Heath Ledger's, The Joker has many faces and motivations. So, I was cool with him.Overall, with Joker and the absolutely fabulous Harley Quinn, the movie barely squeaks to a star over the lowest rating. MAYBE, you can watch this at home, for free, like on Netflix or a free Redbox rental, but only to see them. Everything else is incidental. And bad.***Final thoughts: Shame on you DC. Sadly, there's a post-credit scene (NOT A FAN) and it's a hundred percent rip-off of the Marvel film's post- credit scenes. Almost verbatim. Not to mention, it's something we already know about, so it was pointless. IF you see this movie, you can stay through the first part of the end credits to see this, but be warned: It's just melted icing on an already spoiled cake.",Suicide Squad,1386697
84,Jared_Andrews,What a Waste,3/10,7 August 2016,"Suicide Squad is a total freaking mess. A colorful, yet bleak scattershot of stuff sprayed on a big screen. The movie is like one of those paintings where someone randomly splattered different colors all over a large canvas then called it art.The movie's greatest disappoint is easily The Joker. Granted that following Heath Ledger's iconic performance was going to be impossible for anyone, Jared Leto's character still fell short of even one's more reasonable expectations.Leto made some weird choices. Not weird in a good way, just weird. For one, his Joker played as oddly seductive. I suppose the movie had to give us some reason to believe he landed Harley Quinn, but this part of his persona still felt strange. Plus he wore diamond-studded earrings and flashed some bizarre metallic teeth. He looked half like The Joker and half like some unstable rap mogul.The worst part about The Joker in this movie, and the movie itself, is that he wasn't really necessary. With a small change he could have been removed from the story entirely. The writers just forced him in, probably to appease fans.Similarly, Leto's performance felt forced. His voice, his breathing, his expressions, they didn't seem totally convincing. Perhaps Leto tried too hard to distinguish himself from Ledger's adaptation. Whatever the case, this Joker let me down.Incidentally his love interest, Harley Quinn, highlighted the movie. She delivered an impressive performance and an even more impressive sex appeal. That alone kept the movie watchable at times. It's not really what I look for in a bad-ass superhero/super-villain movie, but if you're going to throw Margot Robbie's ass in my face 15 times in two hours, I'm going to watch.That's all for praise, back to the flaws.The soundtrack annoyed me greatly. To open the movie, each character is introduced, accompanied by a song that I like by itself but hate in the context of the scene since it doesn't fit. The filmmakers want us to empathize with the characters they introduce. We do not, save for Will Smith's Deadshot because he has a charming daughter to look after. Deadshot turns out to be one of the film's top two most intriguing characters (along with Quinn), thanks to Smith's fine acting. Seeing Will Smith in movies again makes me happy. I missed him. Just throwing that out there.After meeting the other baddies, we learn about Enchantress, an ancient spirit witch who has lived for over 6,000 years. She is a part of the suicide squad, or maybe she's not. Amanda Waller (Viola Davis), the one introducing the suicide squad, does not make this clear. It's one of many unanswered questions I had at this point of the movie, and still have after now long after the movie ended.Another, who is Amanda Waller and why is she the one assembling this team? Why did she put the bottle containing Enchantress's brother on her nightstand instead of a secure location? Why did the writers choose to make Killer Croc so uncomfortably racist? Actually, why is Killer Croc even a thing at all? After the intros, Enchantress frees her brother and the two wreak havoc on the city. Cue the suicide squad deployment. Big battle. You get the gist.Despite immense potential and the occasional epic moment, the movie's sloppiness overshadows the high points. I imagine it was hastily rewritten or re-shot a couple times before final edits, so that probably caused the film's scattered nature and often unfocused plot.As many flaws as Suicide Squad has, at least it's better than Fantastic Four.",Suicide Squad,1386697
85,NeoChrys,Looking forward to more Harley and Deadshot!,7/10,6 August 2016,"Although i don't think the Suicide Squad was as good as BvS, it was still a really fun time and it definitely enriched the DCEU as a whole. I think that in general the positive aspects of the movie made up for the not so positive aspects. Most of the performances were A+++. Margot Robbie, Will Smith and Viola Davis killed it. Jared Leto was fine as Joker and i would like to see more of him but i would prefer it if it was always in connection to Harley Quinn. Not as a main villain. Cara Delevinge's acting was weak and i am glad that her storyline has closed for good (hopefully). The team dynamics were great. I thoroughly enjoyed Harley's and Deadshot's ''blooming friendship''. And i believe they will be the fan favorites since they were the ones who got a solid backstory and got scenes throughout the movie that helped you to feel for them. I would have liked to see more of Katana. She was cool but the movie did not help me understand her motivations. I did not have that many problems with the editing. Only in the beginning during the character introductions, the scenes were not flowing so smoothly the one after the other. But after the team assembled it was okay. It is true that the villain was the main negative aspect of the movie. Cara's acting did not help but i believe that in an introductory movie they should have gone with a smaller scale villain. Little less on the supernatural side and more comprehensible. Otherwise they should have devoted a little more time in who Enchantress is, her backstory and her relationship with Rick (because i was supposed to care about their romance too). I understand ofc that using the Enchantress made for a really impressive final battle scene. I did enjoy that very much. The visuals were fantastic.",Suicide Squad,1386697

Letos Joker was something new, it was like a combination of Ledger and something completely new. Voice was clearly the thing combining his and Ledgers Joker but the facial expressions and habits are something i've never seen on screen before. Lets just say that he nailed it, but so did Ben Affleck, Margot Robbie and even Will Smith (I was a bit skeptical about him at first)The biggest let down for me was the villain, just so so bad. She (Enchantress played by Cara Delevingne) was so laughable, couldn't take her seriously I tried I swear. Sadly just like every DC movie from MoS to this has had a weak ending, they all started of so great and had the greatest point just before the intended finale/high point.If the ending is ignored this is a great movie, even if it isn't The Dark Knight or Civil War of movies.",Suicide Squad,1386697
88,anaahnu,Mediocre,6/10,13 October 2016,"A soppy movie, full of sentimental suffering, mourning and all that popular now emo-stuff. In some episodes it does work, anyhow (Rick Flagg's relation with the Enchantress has poor chemistry, but the tear- jerking does save the day). In some episodes it just annoys (there is a little hope for some better Harley-Joker sequences in the extended cut, but I'm speaking now only of the theatrical version).The film has many action scenes, not to say great, but definitely proper ones. And there are some interesting personae, Cap'n Boomerang for instance (though he is a petty copy of Dedpool, some unpleasant charisma about him can be felt). And there are idiotic scenes with the Joker. If you came to see how Harley Quinn became his true attendant, you will not see it. She just falls in love with her psycho patient, because -- Well, because it was in the script. And so ends the story of the greatest love ever between two quirks: just not shown. As if there was nothing to show.I can't say the movie is really bad (Margo Robby does all to turn it from a foolish, sentimental story into something more interesting, even at the count of simple fan-service). This is just a movie to watch when you want rest and relax. Almost no sense, absolutely no idea, characters, as it were, are to be judged only by their outlooks. Turn off your brain, just enjoy a nicely-made show.",Suicide Squad,1386697
89,Equalizer16,Fun not great,6/10,13 August 2016,"The anticipated Suicide Squad is in cinemas and is okay. Following the events of Dawn of Justice, Amanda Waller assembles a team of villains to work together to stop a supernatural threat. Directed by David Ayer (not Snyder) the DC Extended Universe (DCEU) continues to grow by introducing the DC equivalent of Guardians of the Galaxy (the only difference being that Guardians of the Galaxy is a masterpiece). The Squad consists of Deadshot (Will Smith) Haley Quinn (Margot Robbie) Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman) El Diablo (Jay Hernandez) and some other character shoe horned inn, also the Joker Played by Jared Leto.So what is expected of the film on one hand is provided, as kick ass, cool, and loud action to make a real fun cinema experience. On the other hand what was also expected was an awesome strong film with consistency, but this is not quite the same film I saw in the trailers.So what happens to the film is a rushed pace, that goes wonky at the end, with some layered characters next to some very un-layered characters in a narrative with not much consistent direction. What holds the film together is Margot Robbie's performance which really carries everything with her pure insanity. Although Will Smith plays a pretty cool Deadshot, all I see is Smith being the same as he always is in every other film. So what should be a Squad becomes a duo as these two are the only real characters in the whole film. Which brings us to Jared Leto. We all know that no actor could beat the great Heath Ledger when it comes to playing the Joker, and Leto holds no candle at all, by providing a gangster Joker which no one asked for. What Leto does nail is the scary intimidation of the Joker, but struggles to be the Joker we all know and love.What is also a vital part to the film is the action sequences, which are enjoyable at first but end up getting more dramatic. This is also supported by a very strong use of CGI which pretty much invades the whole film. The film also provides entertainment with its humour which we were hoping to quite consistent, but it appears every line has to be delivered by Robbie or Smith as the scene is about to end.What I also found annoying was the narrative as it feels sloppy and does feel like its heading in the direction it should do, and with the consistent mad and fun atmosphere flowing through, but it does not quite match with what it concludes with at the end.The DCEU so far has not had a good start, but at the moment Suicide Squad is the lesser of three evils, with enjoyable action and fun. 7.0/10",Suicide Squad,1386697
90,statuskuo,I Don't Get The Hate,8/10,8 August 2016,"Story? There is no story. And that's what's refreshing about this movie. It's pure entertainment, in the sense of ""Voltron,"" ""A-Team"" or ""G.I. Joe"" which is putting together a unit of absolute bad-a$$es to do something. Does it matter what it is? No.I'm so sick and tired of political messages jammed into Marvel movies (I think comic book movies on DC & Marvel are dumb to begin with). They happen to be the most offensive of the two. I suppose THIS constitutes what the world enjoys now...supposedly. Or the PC police critics.I can't begin to tell you how nice it is NOT to have social agendas in a movie and just...have fun. The hate may stem from the people who love these characters in the book. I can't justify any of it, since I don't read the funny pages, but it seemed to anger a lot of fans of the characters. Personally, Leto's Joker is...too comical for the grit of this movie. He's not as bad as you want him to be or as fun as Nicholson made him out to be. The Ledger Joker was...let's be real, the guy was fishing for recognition. But...it is what it is...entertainment.",Suicide Squad,1386697
91,gundamdestiny,"Good start, falls apart later",5/10,4 August 2016,"Suicide Squad was a film I was not looking forward to after the disaster known as Batman V Superman. As a fan of comics and also as a movie goer, this movie fails on many levels but manages to achieve some things.The Suicide Squad form together to fight Enchantress and her cgi army, they're built up of a bunch of baddies.The start is good but the intros definitely went to long, throughout the story though Will Smith's Deathstroke and Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn are really the main characters, everyone is just supporting i guess. The story becomes quite repetitive and boring after the first half of the film. Once the action starts, a brief break, then back to the action. A formula I don't believe is good enough for a film like this. However this film was more humorous than Batman V Superman, which made it much better in my opinion, I was always excited to see Captain Boomerang as I knew he would always have a joke lined up.Joker Jared Leto's Joker appearance is too short for me to make any sort of judgement but from what I saw he was Okay, not as good as Ledger or Nicholson.This film was better than Batman V Superman mainly because it has more action, and its more light hearted. Will Smith did an alright job, but Margot Robbie really shined as Harley Quinn as she did a very good portrayal of the character.P.S Killer Croc looks so stupid",Suicide Squad,1386697

Will Smith seemed embarrassed or wincing delivering his lines -hard to tell -and as for Jared Leto's OTT indulgent 'acting' -sheesh. Margot Robbie was probably only one whose character had a few good lines. Sad to see the otherwise incredible actress from Secrets and Lies reduced to the ridiculous boss character. The CGI was awful, particularly the monster at the end. Didn't make me feel anything toward the characters -no emotional resonance whatsoever.",Suicide Squad,1386697
93,swilliky,A mediocre super-villain team-up film,5/10,4 August 2016,"DC Films adds to the extended comic universe with supervillains, in this shallow action film stuffed full of characters but short on plot. The movie isn't as terrible as the pro critics made it out to be, it's just nothing special that the hype at first made it out to be. It rests somewhere in the middle of superhero films, not joining Deadpool in the subversive revelry, but not as serious a Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice to make it dull and long. It moves along quickly but this doesn't allow viewers to know any of the characters and hardly lets these meta- humans show off their powers. Will Smith carries the film bringing the brightest star power as Deadshot. Margot Robbie is right behind him laughing and spouting off with a strange New Yorker accent that came off kind of weird. Harley Quinn will be one to watch but her relationship with the Joker (Jared Leto) didn't show much chemistry. The rest of the team is regulated for the background, but Viola Davis takes on the lead role as no-nonsense Amanda Waller, though she doesn't make that much of an impression as she could have. The film jumps from scene to scene pushing a villain that looks like an outtake from Gods of Egypt and Cara Delevingne as the archaeologist June Moon possessed by the Enchantress, who starts off looking cool as a horror movie monster but gets washed over with shoddy special effects.The rest of the team leave something to look forward to if they make a sequel like Boomerang (Jai Courtney), Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), and Katana (Karen Fukuhara). Slipknot (Adam Beach) is hardly worth mentioning as a disposable character. Diablo (Jay Hernandez) does have some shining moment, but it's short lived. Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman) is the loyal soldier, but his romantic involvement with Moon falls flat as the attempt of emotion in this story.

94,jammerknight,So much potential,6/10,13 March 2023,"I went into this movie with high hopes and the first half delivered. The characters introduced were great fun with some good action to boot. Viola Davis cemented her place in DC's future with her standout performance & Margot Robbie was born to play Harley Quinn it would seem but the film failed to live up to the hype largely due to the DC formula of having to end with a giant CGI battle that undoes most of the hard work out in beforehand.I'm not saying this film is perfect without the last act but it had the chance of being so much better. The action is hard to follow and the character played by cara delavine is hard to watch due to the unnecessary CGI.The film is saved from being absolutely abysmal by some of the performances we see and isn't helped by how strong the sequel/requel by James Gunn is.

Quite funny, considering if done right, you don't even notice the editing in the final product. However, anytime it's bad - it's noticeable. And boy, bad editing stands out in this one. It makes a few sequences look really out of place, like shoehorned in. Whoever did the job needs to seriously punished.Lack of the Joker. Seriously, you hired an Oscar-winning guy to play the Clown prince of crime, basically were promoting entire film with him... aaand you cut out maybe 50 % of his scenes. Seriously, the hell is wrong with you, WB? Leto as Joker was fine, I think, based on those few scenes we got, but the exact lack of those didn't convince me that he is better than late Ledger. Which is unfortunate, because I was looking forward to Leto becoming the final Joker. This is essentially my biggest gripe - not enough of Joker. When I think about it, he is pretty much pointless to the ...""plot"" of the film. Makes no impact, whatsoever.The plot. It was going to be simple, sure. I mean, so was Mad max Fury Road and look good that one turned out to be. BvS was aiming for greatness, and say what you want about it, it reached the epic of the clash of the World's finest. Suicide Squad? Basically makes fun of itself, which is NOT the way to go. First half is the actual team-up process, with all the origins stories, setting up and introducing each member. Other half is trying desperately to catch up to the rest of the story and offers very little suspension. There are a lot of plot devices just to make the story moving forward, and that's cheap. Don't get me started on the final fight between the Squad and the main villain - it was retarded. Like, Marvel-level retarded. The Antagonist. Haven't delivered, not one bit. You see all that build-up, expositions of how damn strong he/she is, showing off all them sweet powers and abilities, rendering the villain almost Superman-level OP. His/her plan is silly, with no real reasons to do that, it just happens, and you kinda go with it, because the film itself is entertaining, but.. that just ain't enough.Some members of the Skwad. are beyond useless and out of place. The one is there only just to serve as a comedic relief, another one is wasted in like first 5 minutes after the team is deployed into action (I know it's in the cannon, but this is a film - act like you give a damn), and some other that is seriously underused and looks like he is there just to do that one thing the plot requires in order for the Skwad to succeed.The Music. I was afraid this would be an issue, and I called it. The whole film made an impression of a 2-hour MTV music-video-mash-up. It was refreshing for the first 40 minutes, but then it keeps on going and going, playing another tune after another, with no particular need, it's just there to ""lighten-up"" the mood of the film - I call bullshit. On the other hand, the movie made a damn good job of making me guess all of the classic hits from the past, so props for that!Batman cameos. You are going to see Batman from a different perspective, they said. You will get to experience the fear and thrill the bad guys experience when they see The Bat show up, they said. None of that happens. You get regular ""Batman interacting with the bad guys"" sequences, that do NOT stand out. Another wasted potential.The pluses are: visuals - those are top-notch (obivously, Mr. Snyder was involved as an exec. producer)Deadshot, Harley, Joker (given the screen time he had..), Amanda Waller (you are going to hate her.. A LOT. Makes Nick Fury from the friendly Marvel neighbor look like one-eyed tooth-fairy), El Diablo (surprisingly enough, he is the MVP during the last 30 minutes), soundtrack (good choice of tracks and spot-on timing) and that's pretty much it.Final thoughts. It is obvious that for some reason, this film turned out to compete with the Guardians of the Galaxy instead of being full-scaled dark action thriller with formidable Bad Guy, bad-ass team that gets stuff done, supervillains acting like..you know, supervillains (not some wanna-be heroes they ARE NOT), and an occasional one-liner here and there for the healthy laugh. Instead we got the DCEU version of GoTG with far more music and far less chemistry. I still liked this film, took it for what it was. It just didn't deliver. The entire mid-credit scene was somewhat good, but at the same time unnecessary. Bottom Line: Batman V Superman remains on the top of the DCEU (and entire comic-book films genre for me) food chain. Here's hoping that Patty Jenkin's ""Wonder Woman"" will be better (which for now seems like will happen) and that the Justice League will be the best comic book film ever made, finally topping The Dark Knight.Interesting fact: Zack Snyder directed Flash's cameo scene in this film - one of the good parts of the Suicide Squad.",Suicide Squad,1386697
