0,cardsrock,"Cliched, but a reasonably fun time",6/10,11 April 2020,"Kathyrn Hahn absolutely steals the show in this comedy about moms rebelling. She's a riot and the film somewhat drags when she isn't on screen. It never takes full advantage of its premise, but there's enough talented actors involved to lift it up above most raunchy comedies like this. It won't blow your mind, however you should be able to find some good laughs.

1,nogodnomasters,I would rather go to Afghanistan than another kid's baseball game,7/10,24 October 2017,"Amy (Mila Kunis) is the lead ""bad mom."" She can no longer be a ""super mom"" in the Chicago suburbs. She befriends Kiki (Kristen Bell) and Carla (Kathryn Hahn) who are also tired of the whole super mom concept. With Wanda Sykes as a marriage counselor, she is a single mom. Amy butts heads with super mom Gwendolyn (no longer a hot teen Christina Applegate) vindictive president of the P.T.A. Amy is ""good at being late."" This is another over-the-top over-sexed potty mouthed woman comedy. ""Bridesmaids"" establish a successful formula and opened the flood gates for future endeavors, i.e. ""Sister"" and anything with Melissa McCarthy. I am not saying this is bad, but sometimes less is more and originality still counts for something.This was a funny comedy, and perhaps would have been funnier if I didn't watch so many films in this genre.Guide: F-word, sex, FF nudity (Leah McKendrick) strong sex talk",Bad Moms,4651520
2,anaconda-40658,Bad Movie.,2/10,8 August 2016,"Bad Moms (2016): Dir: Jon Lucas, Scott Moore / Cast: Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell, Kathryn Hahn, Christina Applegate, Jada Pinkett Smith: Bad movie plainly with a gripe about the tiresome schedule of motherhood. Mila Kunis as Amy Mitchell is the one passable character in this garbage. She caught her husband engaging in Internet sex so she kicks him out and discovers her schedule getting tighter. She makes friends with Kiki, played by Kristen Bell who is meant to be quirky and funny but just comes off as plain annoying. Kathryn Hahn as Carla advocate the need for sex within nearly every word that emerges from her mouth and it grows old quick. Christina Applegate and Jada Pinkett Smith are a total waste as antagonist school board bullies intent on pushing their agenda to the point of even stashing marijuana in the locker of Amy's daughter. The premise is rushed and the structure is predictable and boring. This is bad in more ways than one with two directors committing to a choppy and uninspiring job with production values straight out of the worst of direct-to- video bargain bid deals. Sure, it has a worthwhile message of the stress of motherhood, especially those balancing a job as well but the results here are embarrassing. The film concludes with the actresses sitting with their mothers discussing their upbringings. That is better than anything that appears in the film. This is clearly a film aimed at mothers and for them I say, good luck. This film is lackluster with no sign of an existing screenwriter. Perhaps the mothers could have gathered and wrote something that wasn't this bad. Score: 2 ½ / 10",Bad Moms,4651520
3,bob-the-movie-man,Inconsistent laughs in a comedy of parental duty,5/10,19 August 2016,"Penned by the writers of ""The Hangover"" (Jon Lucas and Scott Moore), this was a film I went into with really, really low expectations. But it was better than I expected it to be.Mila Kunis (which we already know means ""Fine"" in Navajo) plays Amy, a normal working Mum (albeit clearly living in a hugely affluent neighbourhood) with a no-good husband and two kids. Amy is at the end of her tether, and as parents haven't we all been there? After one particularly dreadful day she uncharacteristically heads for a bar and forms a firm friendship with hen-pecked wife and Mum Kiki (an excellent Kristen Bell) and the potty-mouthed and kick-ass Carla (Kathryn Hahn). Making a pact to not follow convention they decide to be ""Bad Moms"" which brings them into direct conflict with Gwendoline (""Anchorman""'s Christina Applegate), the tyrannical head of the school Parent Teacher Association and her fawning sidekicks Stacy (Jada Pinkett Smith, ""Matrix"" sequels) and Vicky (Annie Mumulo, ""Bridesmaids""). As attacks get personal, Amy is forced into standing against Gwendoline for the PTA chair and a battle royale ensues.From the film's publicity, I expected this to be a ""3 go mad in Vegas"" style of romp, but it didn't head in that direction. True that there is one very funny and well-cut scene of craziness in a supermarket (""Kids, we're going to have to find a new supermarket""), but the film has a more thoughtful tone reflecting as it does the stresses on working parents exacerbated by the need to conform to social mores.It would be dangerous at this point for me, as a man, to appear sexist and misogynist, so I will quote (and credit) my wife here in commenting that the film is like a ""Next Generation"" movie to 1987's Diane Keaton vehicle ""Baby Boom"". In that film Keaton's character has to juggle a corporate working life with unexpected child rearing: something still relatively unusual in those days (yes folks, things have changed a LOT for the better in 30 years). ""Bad Moms"" skims forward to today when being a working parent is almost a given, but the characters in the film view that maybe that swing has gone too far - that there is not enough time for them to treasure and nurture their kids. Here the film does slip into sexist territory in featuring all the struggling ""Moms"" as predominantly female: the one single Dad (hunk and love interest Jay Hernandez) never seems stressed or out of his depth.So, there is a good concept in here, but to be honest it is not particularly well executed. Given that it is supposed to be a comedy, the limited laughs supplied are well distributed throughout the film. It's more of a smile-along than a laugh-along.The film is also pretty inconsistent in tone, flipping as it does from the leads being ""Bad Moms"" to being lovey-dovey ""aren't my kids adorable""parents. For a UK audience I would suggest that there is way, WAY too much sickly hugging of kids going on. And - without spoilers - the denouement at the ending is far from satisfying.On the plus side, it is technically well delivered, and looks like bloody Shakespeare compared to the truly execrable ""Dirty Grandpa"". The editing is slick and the music choice and music editing is particularly good. Some of the performances - especially those of Bell and Hahn - are great. And a particular nod to young Oona Laurence as Amy's daughter who carries her part really nicely.In terms of the lead, Mila Kunis wouldn't seem to be a natural choice for a comedy part, although her performance is kookily watchable (that might just be the ""fine"" influence on me). A low point however is a post-sex scene where Kunis appears to have been watching ABC News rather than doing any sort of strenuous horizontal jogging (not that my wife noticed this as she was MUCH too distracted by who was acting on the other side of the bed). If anyone puts together a top 10 of unconvincing movie sex scenes, this is a strong contender.Comedies are very personal things. Might this one be right for you? I would suggest that if you are not a parent, you should probably skip it and wait for the TV showing - - many of the situations are those that only parents who've been through the more hellish moments of child rearing will relate to! It's also not for the very prudish. There is a lot of bad language, a bit of nudity and drug references, although it doesn't quite descend to the same gross-out level comedy of ""The Hangover"" or a Farrelly brothers film.A final shout-out to the goofy final credits, done in ""When Harry Met Sally"" style, where the actresses real mothers talk about whether they were good mum's or not. (Cue more hugging).(Please visit http://bob-the-movie-man.com to see the graphical version of this review, and to make comment. Thanks.).",Bad Moms,4651520
4,Prismark10,Bad movie,2/10,19 October 2016,"Mila Kunis plays a hard working mom with two kids. She juggles her work life which involves endless meetings and working extra hours even though she only works part time with her family life of getting the kids ready for school, doing their homework, picking them up for school and taking them to various activities as well as shopping and cooking.We are not sure where the dad fits in all this, he appears to be a slob with an interest in internet porn.No one takes her seriously and when she throws her husband out she falls out with the bullying head of the PTA played by Christina Applegate.Mila along with two other mothers, one who is timid, the other a slovenly herself join ranks and indulge in some bad behaviour of drinking, partying and attracting men.This puts them on a collision course with Applegate who treats the PTA as her very own fiefdom.The film is marketed as a gross out comedy centred on females, a bit like Bridesmaids. It just comes across as wretched and unfunny. The writing is atrocious. You have a head of PTA threatening to sack school staff and doing illegal things yet no one seems to notice even if it is common assault in front of witnesses.It just shows what a poorly contrived mess the whole film is.",Bad Moms,4651520
5,hjalsayegh,A thirty something's fantasy,4/10,13 August 2016,"In your own head you are not only supermom you are also a martyr that would sacrifice everything for your family.You are ridiculously hot, you do everything at home and at work (literally) and without you the world would come crumbling down, yet you are under appreciated and treated like dirt.All in 6 inch heels, flawless make-up and not a hair out of place...The movie is what Hollywood thinks soccormoms fantasy themselves as. They would break away from their roles and be ""bad girls"" for a day and that would bring balance back to the force.I didn't mind the cliché however the humor here is really either hit or miss. You'll either stare in silence at the screen going ""what? was that supposed to be a joke? It looked painful/offensive/silly"" then there are the jokes that land and those are really funny in comparison... they don't happen often enough to cover for the bad jokes though.Harmless enough of a movie if there is nothing else on but otherwise I wouldn't recommend it.",Bad Moms,4651520
6,cosmo_tiger,One of the funniest movies of the year and one that men and women will both love plus the message doesn't get lost in the comedy.,8/10,1 November 2016,"""In this day and age it's impossible to be a good mom."" Amy (Kunis) is doing her best to juggle being a mom and having a career. Things begin to pile up and finally hits a breaking point when she is asked to be on a PTA board. Now, taking back control of her life her and her new friends stand up to Gwendolyn (Applegate) and the other perfect moms and let everyone know that it's OK not to be perfect. This is a movie I was was hoping would be funny, but being a guy I wasn't the target audience and wasn't sure if I would relate. I was wrong. This movie is hilarious regardless of what sex your are and being a single dad I can also relate to some of what was being said. At the risk of sounding chauvinistic (which is not my intention) this is a raunchy male sex comedy starring women. The thing this has going for it over most movies like this is that the message doesn't get lost in the comedy and really helps add to the overall enjoyment of this. Overall, one of the funniest movies of the year and one that men and women will both love. That is hard to do in a movie like this. I give this an A.",Bad Moms,4651520
7,lancelong777,Was This Supposed to Be a Comedy,1/10,2 August 2016,"I honestly don't know what to say about this horrendous, terribly unfunny movie except I wish I could get my money and time back for the waste that was this movie. Here is a suggestion - watch the movie before you release it. And, if it is supposed to be a comedy, make sure the movie makes you laugh. I know for a fact that none of you rich movie producers and stars watched this crappy film. And, if you did and told Mila Kunis that she was funny, I have to say, shame on you for lying to her. And Mila, if you watched this movie and still let them release it - you are a moron. The funniest part is when somebody says a funny word about their body parts and it just wasn't that amusing. I guess the other two people in the room didn't think it was very funny either because I never heard one person laugh for more than a moment. I think I laughed more while watching ""Hannibal."" Do not go to see this pile of crap. It was awful.

8,CineMuseFilms,a lighthearted slapstick comedy on the shaming of stressed-out moms,6/10,17 August 2016,"The shaming of women is a global phenomenon that unfortunately is part of everyday life. Filmmakers, media and marketing industries prey on women's anxieties about their bodies, and motherhood is another favourite target. While the documentary Embrace (2016) calls out body shaming, the comedy Bad Moms (2016) calls out the impossible standards to which modern mothers are expected to conform. Laughter carries this message more effectively than polemic but make no mistake: while this film is funny it also has serious things to say. The plot line is all too familiar. Over-worked mom Amy (Mila Kunis) is always running between the needs of her spoilt two children, a lazy husband, a part-time job, homework, school rules, and endless extra-curricular activities. The kids are overscheduled, over-controlled and over-indulged, and like too many parents everywhere, the homework is for Amy. When she ditches the husband for having a cyber-sex affair her already chaotic world nears breaking point. That's when the pushy cabal of PTA perfect moms and yummy mummies insist on ever-more elaborate cake-bakes. When she publicly quits the PTA, the snobby dominatrix president Gwendolyn (Christina Applegate) launches a vendetta against Amy and her kids. She retaliates by campaigning for president and the internecine warfare between mom camps escalate in hilarious ways. Deserted by the school, her nearest friends become her emotional anchors and all give themselves permission to party and carry on. While the story is predictable and at times corny, the underlying issues are totally real. The slapstick comedy softens the pointed message about just how powerless mothers are against the onslaught of unrealistic expectations. The bigger irony is that so many movies perpetuate the myth of the perfect mom without even questioning the existence of the perfect dad.This film is obviously targeted directly at stressed-out moms but dads should watch too. If nothing else, it exposes the gender inequality that persists in parenting and the bigger injustice of 'perfect moms' shaming other moms for not meeting politically correct standards. When Amy gives her election speech and confesses all the ways she is a bad mom she starts a sisterhood chorus of bad moms all needing to offload their guilt about the things they have not done for their children. While it's always possible to find aspects of a film that could have been made better, this film deserves praise for going in to bat for the most honourable profession on the planet.",Bad Moms,4651520
9,Kevin_C1,A Bad Movie for Moms,3/10,4 August 2016,"Five minutes into Bad Moms, I already knew that I had made the wrong choice. I was hoping for a silly comedy staring some actresses I find to be hilarious (Kristen Bell, Kathryn Hahn.) This was not the case, as most of the jokes are raunchy, cringe-worthy mom jokes.The worst thing about this movie, which is obvious from the opening monologue, is that it is corny. The story is corny. The characters are corny. The jokes are corny. The only audience that might let them get away with this cheese-fest, is mothers, because they will be able to relate.This movie has its moments, but the majority of its laughs fall flat. Particularly bad were a couple of different montages, specifically, one of the girls drunk grocery shopping. Most disappointing is how unfunny Kathryn Hahn is, it seems that every word that comes out her mouth has to do with sex.This movie also fails to follow some of the basic rules of a screenplay. The characters speak for the writer, not for themselves. The main conflict doesn't even come up until half way through the movie.The brightest spot of this movie is Kristen Bell's character Kiki, who is a weird stay at home mom. She provides almost all of the enjoyment you will get out of this film. JJ Watt and Martha Stewart also have funny cameos.I would not recommend this movie unless you are a mother. If you are anything but, avoid this train wreck at all costs.Game of Thrones SPOILERS BELOWThey also spoiled Jon Snow's death for the sake of a mediocre joke. Not Cool.",Bad Moms,4651520
10,internetuser1655,A failure with some nasty hateful parts,3/10,29 July 2016,"This is another example of how a good comedy is far more difficult to make than a good drama or action flick.I was dragged along to this movie by a friend hoping that it would not be as bad as the trailers and TV spots suggested. It is. I really wanted this movie to surprise me, to make me laugh to make me care for the characters and have some investment in the story, but it failed to achieve any of that. What I saw was a two hour mess of a movie. An unfunny, poorly written, poorly edited, contrived cash-in on the beloved Hangover franchise. It has some of the poorest dialogue and worst performances I've seen in a while. I honestly can't think of any redeeming qualities that this film has.The ugly gag about uncircumcised men is particularly nasty and reveals a mean spirit considering that circumcision rates are declining in the USA and currently at only about 60%. So that's almost half the domestic population that has been insulted by the dirtbags responsible for this disaster. What pathology is behind this scene one can only guess at.",Bad Moms,4651520
11,paul_haakonsen,When mommy breaks out of the everyday routine...,6/10,2 May 2017,"""Bad Moms"" was a movie that I was actually looking forward to getting a chance to sit down and watch because I like Mila Kunis, but also because Kathryn Hahn and Christina Applegate were starring in it.This is the type of comedy movie that you just know will not challenge your intellect, so it is just basically lean well back in the chair and enjoy the ride. I found ""Bad Moms"" to actually be better than I had anticipated it to be, so that was a good surprise.The storyline is quite simplistic really. A group of mothers are fed up with the way that they have to live their lives and perform up to the expectations of every other mother in the PTA group. This liberation leads to a much needed freedom, fun, and comedic self-indulgence.There is a lot of hilarious moments and situations throughout the course of the movie, and the comedy is served to the audience in terms of both practical and visual comedy, but also by some outrageous and funny dialogue.While Mila Kunis actually did a great job in this movie, she was just outshone by Kathryn Hahn and her performance here. The movie was so well carried by the female cast, though again I will credit most of the lifting to Kathryn Hahn.""Bad Moms"" is a very funny and entertaining movie, and if you enjoy comedies where there are little limitations. There might be situations that some people will find to be a bit too much, but hey, this is an R-rated movie.This is also the type of comedy that you can watch again, although I would say that some time should definitely pass in between such multiple viewings. This is hardly a comedy classic, but it still a very enjoyable and entertaining comedy.",Bad Moms,4651520
12,sergioschout,contender of the most horrible movie of 2016,1/10,20 August 2016,"We had been treated on a real horror-esque fest this summer. From botched up remakes of movies to well bad moms. There are no redeeming qualities. At least the new Ghostbusters had me laughing a bit now and again but this movie is nearly as bad as Himalaya, a three + hour movie i was forced to watch in highschool of how indigenous people herd their yaks over the mountain paths. I never walked out on a movie, except on this one.But back to the movie. Really Really bad script, not funny, man hating, failure to communicate and no sense of humor sums this erghm ""movie"" up quite nicely. basically story goes like this; Women make active choices they later regret ( like finding wealthy men and marrying them, plus having kids while sitting at home or just fail to produce anything noteworthy because of the lack of education... because they got children quite early). Then the say enough is enough.. go girlpower.. and act like deranged immature college frat boys/girls. Then they roll stupid and immature with each other and smash it into one big pretzel of fail.So conclusion: actresses, though still easy on the eyes seem to be the ones with their careers winding down ( some aren't as good of an actress to begin with). the so called humor is so immature that it is facepalm retch worthy. The script is even worse and yes, one could argue that actresses can't shine if the script is terrible.To end there is a disturbing trend in Hollywood where in certain movies the ""hate"" for one or more groups, oftentimes men in general, can see oozing like a slimer that just flew through the theater screen. Directors some advice: keep your SJW/feminasty social construct politics and Utopian dreams out of a movie that could have been OK-ish if you had bothered writing a half decent script.",Bad Moms,4651520

Kunis (Ted, That 70's Show) plays Amy, a working mom who never has time for herself. Soon, she and 2 other moms, Kiki (Bell) and Carla (Hahn) decide to relax and have fun by cutting down their everyday routines. Applegate (Anchorman, Married with Children) plays Gwendolyn, an obnoxious, PTA member and Smith (Collateral) plays her friend, Stacy.

14,rjkjklose,Bad Moms but not a bad film.,7/10,23 October 2016,"The surprise hit ""Bad Moms"" is a comedy starring Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell and Kathryn Hahn and is directed by both Scott Moore and Jon Lucas. This movie centers itself around Amy (Mila Kunis) a mother of two who is a bit of a perfectionist. She aspires for her family to have the best that the world can offer. Unfortunately, after a series of bad events everything goes downhill fast. Luckily Amy befriends two other struggling mothers Kiki (Kristen Bell) and Carla (Kathryn Hahn) who work together to try and make some sense of their crazy lives, while having some fun at the same time. First and foremost, ""Bad Moms"" works extremely well. I can honestly say that this movie completely shattered my expectations. While the film isn't breaking any new ground or providing any sort of different approach to the extremely over saturated comedy genre, it is fun. That's right, the film from start to finish never fails to entertain. The films humor works on multiple levels. The jokes here never quite seem to stop coming and the entire film feels thoroughly littered with hilarious moments. This is an excellent break from many modern day comedies where all of the jokes come in both the first fifteen and last fifteen minutes. Raunchy humor was obviously a big selling point for this movie, yet thankfully the movie never feels too overbearing with its vulgarity. Never once did I notice a particular character was dropping ""F-Bombs"" just for the sake of it, but when they did the jokes were hilarious. Writing in this movie is the chemistry between these actresses also felt extremely tight and without it the film just would not have gelled correctly. All of the actors here are surprisingly funny. Even Kathryn Hahn's (who I have found quite annoying and overly rambunctious in past outings) character here proves to be hilarious and she never misses a beat. Mila Kunis and Kristen Bell also play very entertaining and likable characters. Another surprise was Christian Applegate, Jada Pinkette Smith and Annie Mumolo's performances as the villain moms. While at times they got a tad too outrageous for their own good, these three women were truly amusing and helped further the comedic aspects of the film. Also, a huge shout out to Martha Stewart's hilarious cameo in the film. The only negative that can really be geared toward the acting in this film is the child actors. While I'm sure these kids didn't exactly chose the writing they were given, they come off as spoiled little brats. Throughout the entire movie these kids constantly pestered the overall fun tone that this movie was riding on. Speaking of tone, this movies strength comes from the lighthearted nature of the plot. The movie is surprisingly heartwarming, yet never overbearing on its themes of family unity. The film knows it's a comedy and it sticks to being a comedy very well, something that can be attributed to the excellent direction and writing in the film. Yet another strong suit in ""Bad Moms"" has to be its well-rounded pacing. Very seldom in this film does it feel like the plot is glossing over important story points. Impressively it does this while at the same time remaining consistently funny. Moving on to the soundtrack and overall sound design of the film: The soundtrack while not exactly bad, is utterly forgettable. Audiences will struggle to remember a single track and relating scene in the film by the next day. Going into this movie I completely expected a bland over saturated film about female characters going wild. Instead what I received was a smart film that carries extremely strong female characters without having them seem needy and dependent, something that haunts the film industry today. Luckily this film does all of these things while remaining consistently hilarious and surprisingly sincere. Ultimately ""Bad Moms"" suffers a few minor hiccups along the way, but comes out a surprisingly hilarious and fun romp.",Bad Moms,4651520
15,lee_eisenberg,"we have no real lives today, and that's why we need this",10/10,6 August 2016,"More than just an over-the-top silly comedy, ""Bad Moms"" is a satire on our overly organized lives in the 21st century. The main characters are a group of moms in Chicago who get fed up with their daily schedules - going to work, taking their children to extracurricular activities, etc - and rebel. Basically, they decide to violate all social conventions and live life to its fullest, much to the chagrin of the authoritarian head of the PTA. Everyone in the theater, including myself, was laughing the whole time (especially whenever Carla had a comment).I have a feeling that quite a few moms out there would love to do this. In the meantime, it's been nice to see female-driven comedies this year (along with this one, there's ""The Boss"" and ""Ghostbusters""). I liked the movie, and I hope that the directors do more stuff like this.

16,nyiri-timea,What did I just watch?,1/10,24 August 2016,"Oh my, oh my, where to start. It was supposed to be a comedy still I did not smile ones during the film - and I love smiling so that shouldn't be an impossible mission. At one point I considered I may cry a little because it was so pathetic - the uncircumcised penis scene - but it wasn't even pathetic enough for that. The whole film was nothing - well, at least the first hour, I just couldn't watch the rest of it. It didn't make itself believable enough to be enjoyable as a comedy, because even with a comedy you have to care about the characters or at least believe they could exist in some universe. And if it tried to go the more satiric road than it was too believable for that. I don't know what it was, other than a really bad movie and a complete waste of time and money.

We knew the movie would be bad, but this was so so so much worse. I find movies funny when they contain some authenticity. When I can say, ""Wow, this is over-the-top, but there's a shred of truth here."" Ummm, no. This had the same sentiment as an ABC Family movie, but mixed with the worst frat boy humor available. I doubt whether the writers have actually met mothers. Do they even know their own mothers? I laughed because I was EMBARRASSED. Like, wow, has the world come to this? Please make this movie again but with actual characters and an actual premise. Make it somewhat believable or at least make it funny.

18,Oberrated,Sure-fire box office hit.... For the targeted demographic,4/10,1 August 2016,"Very very unsatisfying film. While it had plenty of moments of comedy that I did laugh at and a number of one liners that worked well. The whole thing fell flat for me. The story was absolutely laughable, and not in the positive way. The climax/feels moment made me feel absolutely nothing because it was stupid to begin with. The love interest of the movie is forced and could be done without entirely. Just almost every plot point was unrealistic and forgetful. To the critical mind, this film falls way short of being anything special. To the targeted demographic that the film focuses on, this film will be a sure fire box office hit to them. So unless you fall within the first bracket and are a film lover, this is an easy pass, ladies and gentleman.

19,thomas-junior,Horrible,1/10,28 October 2016,"Just tell me why Mila Kunis ALWAYS has perfect makeup in every movie. She woke up from being super wasted and partying and had not a smudge on her face. Please tell me why it is funny to torment people who work at a super market? Really? I work 40 hours a week getting bad wages so that drunk people can come in and make my job harder? Whoever made this movie is clueless. Why are we basically laughing at these people who suffer in the hourly market. What is funny about that? We are the people that put you in your nice houses. Mila K. should be blocked from making movies. Christina, I expected more from you. This is dumb college humor that is from college kids that flunked out.

20,kimberly-chanin,Absolutely awful.,2/10,1 August 2016,"I would have given this movie a 3/10, but the lower rating is from sheer disappointment. This movie had such a great idea, but was executed so poorly.We see a hard-working mom of two with the stereotypical doof-ball husband, dealing with PTA moms who seemingly have nothing better to do than make her life harder.Aside from the TERRIBLE acting, horrible cringe inducing dialogue, it just wasn't funny. The countless crappy attempts at ""humor"" fell flat on their face over and over and, had I not been with a friend, I would have left after 15 minutes.But I had to endure a SAGA of ridiculous story lines, and so many loose end tie ups. By the end I was actually willing the movie to stop so I could leave.Just, so awful. Terrible performances, a terrible script, a disgrace to the film industry and moms everywhere.

21,fishontheroad,"Such a cliché film, I'm so disappointed!",1/10,1 September 2016,"This is the second time in my life that I have walked out of a film. The first time was an art-house movie where a lady was writhing around on a floor of broken mirrors reciting Japanese haikus whilst crying for 40 minutes. I'm not sure which of the two was worse.Let me preface this - I am a working mother around the same age as some of the characters in this film. None of this rings true to me, mostly because of the way the script was written (by a couple of men who have clearly no idea what being a working mum is). The cast is great, the idea is great. It should have almost been the Clueless of the next generation on (humour wise). The women end up looking humiliated for being meek or embarrassingly gross. We have no idea where their children are when they decide to go AWOL. 'Hey - want to go to the movies?' 'Sure! I'll just dump these 4 under 5s somewhere and we'll go to a bar'. Hmmm.My two friends and I lasted 20 minutes. There was a big crowd of younger girls, possibly not yet having had kids, that were laughing their heads off. So I think there is a market for this.

Instead I was faced with no laughs and no comedy. The 'jokes' are crude and rely on crude sexual references throughout, with the odd bit of slapstick when the writers just couldn't be bothered any more. The circumcised penis scene was embarrassing to watch, it could be considered highly offensive and sexist and will alienate the vast majority of male viewers.The premise of hard working mothers making a few mistakes when bringing up their children and gain some redemption against judgmental parents who can do no wrong, isn't too bad. However, it is ruined by a dreadful script and a frank lack of effort. The idea that a wealthy, middle-class American mother rules the school from her role as the PTA president is ludicrous. A popularity context then ensues and after a spontaneous rave at house party full of mothers, that includes a random girl-on-girl kissing scene for no apparent reason, leads to the most obvious result in a PTA presidential election (if that's even a thing.Mila Kunis is poorly cast as a 32 year old working mom with a twelve year old daughter and a son. She does not fit the role and her situation is just difficult to believe and relate to (she lives in an enormous, immaculate house for example).

23,riskitallwinitall,"""Bad Moms"" Is A Good Comedy",8/10,19 November 2016,"Mila Kunis plays an overburdened and stressed mother/wife who has had it with her bratty kids, lazy and cheating husband, a jerk of a boss, and the de facto leader (played by Christina Applegate) of the school that Kunis' kids attends. So one day she decides to no longer put in 100% all day every day, instead being satisfied with just getting by; and laying down the law with all those who have abused her and taken her for granted for so long. What follows is a revelation that no mom is perfect, and it's okay as long as one loves their children and teaches them to be good people. My most memorable, movie moment of ""Bad Moms"" is the scene when Kristen Bell, who plays a mousy mom, finally stands up to her hubby and yells ""And I said, I'm going to the f****ng PTA meeting with my f****ng friends, so stop being such a goddamn p***y and make it work!""

I always read some reviews before watching the movie I picked. I'm a huge fan of horror and comedy. I'm totally a movie freak.What's the whole deal about this movie? I couldn't stop laughing. That humor salad was well served!These days its hard to have a good laugh on films, like Bad Moms. It is a comedy! Free the tense. If you didn't, at least a little smile on that supermarket scene you are cold! Katheryn hahn is the best!!!!🎂Overall, this is a very enjoyable flick.

25,amichnea,Why the bad reviews?,10/10,21 October 2016,"Again I am baffled by the bad reviews (too many films are receiving bad reviews for no reason). Must be the many intellectuals out there that prefer to watch documentaries instead of plain old fun and entertaining films.The movie is not going to win any awards that's for sure but I actually laughed and found it very entertaining.I watched this with my other half, both professionals and I would consider myself as intellectual when it counts. We both found it extremely entertaining despite the bad rep this film has received. It is a fun light-hearted comedy, feel good movie that touches on the reality of today's world. It is an accurate representation of today's life especially as a mother or stay at home mum. It also shows what men and employers think of working women or stay at home mums. To the people that rated it 1 star, why? did it actually touch a nerve?",Bad Moms,4651520
26,n-kefala,Fun and motherhood,4/10,28 July 2016,"In this new comedy from the writers of ""The Hangover"", you can expect drugs, sex, bad language and lot of drinks. If you have watched ""The Hangover"" then you know what I mean, only that this time we deal with motherhood and women in crisis. There are some laughs and some sentimental (nothing too serious though), but they are not enough for making a forgettable movie. But it's an entertaining comedy and the performances are funny and not so bad as... the moms are. It's summer time and a movie like this seems ideal- I wouldn't recommended to watch it with your kids because of all that mentioned above. Motherhood is difficult but still you can have fun. nikisreviews.com

27,Horst_In_Translation,"Bad Moms, even worse movie",2/10,19 December 2017,"""Bad Moms"" is an American 100-minute movie from 2016 written and directed by Scott Moore and Jon Lucas, the duo mostly known for The Hangover at this point still. And you could say that their work here is a mom version of the latter, but really a very unfunny one I must say. I may be a bit biased because there are several cast members in here that I am not much a fan of like Hahn, Bell and Smith, so it's no surprise that I would say it is between Hahn and Smith in terms of who is most unbearable in here. Probably Hahn gets the edge because she has so much more screen time, but JPS is a negative scene stealer too. The one who was pretty okay was Applegate, but being a huge MwC fan I'm probably biased here too. And how she completely changes towards the end and tells her big nemesis how her life sucks too was ridiculously bad with how she turns into a friend finally. This was a cringeworthy film from start to finish. Women often complain about how they are depicted in films. Strangely enough, some are mistaking this film for an elaboration on emancipation. Well, they should complain too given this film, but so should the males who are shown as bullies, cheaters etc. or of course Mr. Right. This movie has nothing to do with reality. It lacks authenticity and convincing shades from start to finish and I can only feel sorry for those audience members thinking the trio in here includes actually amazing women despite their flaws and struggles. Oh wait, those make them human no? I can only shake my head at that.Kunis is at the center of it all, but Hahn and Bell get their rushed-in ""deep"" and ""emotionally dramatic"" story lines too that involve the men in their lives that occasionally are also their sons. Pseudo character development of the worst kind. One bad joke follows the next in the film's extremely desperate attempts to be constantly funny. Sometimes less is more you know. I hoped this film would be better to be honest and I went in with an open mind, but I quickly saw this was not a good piece of work before eventually realizing this was horribly bad and a contender for 2016's worst. Shocked to see that this holiday season 2017 they are actually having a sequel out. Judging from this first film here, I have zero interest to watch it. I don't mind profanity if it has some wit attached to it (like South Park), but here this is definitely not the case. Everything about this project feels fake and for the sake of it, especially most of the performances. Kunis' maybe not, but she also does nothing really with her character. She just isn't as terrible as the other key players. The writing certainly isn't helping. A poor predictable excuse of a movie and let me say to my fellow German movie buffs that here we have the American equivalent to a Schweighöfer comedy. For the easily-entertained. The simple-minded. Highly not recommended.",Bad Moms,4651520
28,Bored78,Great Movie,10/10,13 December 2016,"I am glad i don't watch movies based on reviews. This is one of the best comedies I have watched in a while. I think people take movies to seriously and that is why it got bad reviews.The movie was well written. I loved the story and I'm sure many moms could relate to the story. The title description tells you it is a story about over worked and under appreciated moms. And that is exactly what it is about.These moms are only bad if you consider June Cleaver to be the minimum standard for being a good mom. The story does show us how mom's can easily be overworked and have almost impossible expectations of them. And how selfless they are sacrificing ""me time"" for a never ending list of duties. Finally reaching the point where they say "" OK, enough, i need a break. Others are going to have to pick up the slack for a bit""This movie portrays this in a comedic way. Some of the best comedy i've seen out of Hollywood in a while. Me and my wife both thought this was a very funny movie and had some good laughs while enjoying the story. All the characters were interesting and likable even the ones you are not suppose to really like. The acting was solid. The story was easy to follow and understand both what was going on and how the characters felt. You could relate to the characters.My wife doesn't often tell her friends, "" You have to watch this movie!"" This is one movie she told her friends they must watch. Ill end up owning a DVD of this movie. Its worthy of watching multiple times.",Bad Moms,4651520

Poor acting, very poor writing. The worse part beyond all else to me was the music. It felt like every five minutes it cut out to slow motion shots and an energetic pop song. This was kinda cool the first time they did it but than again, and again, and again. It lost all meaning and just got on my nerves. I think the writers even got board with this movie because in about 3 minutes at the end everything fell in place and it was over. Whew.I am not sure what the target audience was but I probably wasn't it, however I usually enjoy edgy humor and I enjoy chick flicks so I was expecting to like this movie but it fell really flat.",Bad Moms,4651520
30,Ruskington,The title is half right I guess,3/10,17 April 2020,"A truly awful cast coupled with the usual unimaginative writing stumbling through every cliche in the Hollywood book.The idea that Mila Kunis is a desperate singleton who can't get a man because of her 'mom-bra' is an insult to the viewer and reason enough to turn this nonsense off. The other supposed 'Bad Moms' are little more than crappy parents with attitude problems.This is just lame mildly sexist nonsense trying desperately to appeal to an audience who won't even watch a film like this. Garbage.

No sophisticated plot - mother of 2 is having hard time balancing her kids, husband and work, so she decides to quit trying to do everything perfect. She stops helping kids with their homework or making their breakfast, kicks out her sort of cheating husband and decides to run for PTA president with help of two new friends - one divorced cougar and one meek housewife. Rated R - only because of strong language, which is not surprising - you can kill 100 people on screen and still be PG, but if you use C*word - you get R-rated ;) Watch it and have fun, brain-relaxing experience.

Not a surprise is levied for the audience, and not a f*** is given as far as really trying something new with the story.Would I ever tell anyone to see this? No. It's a fairly rote studio comedy, with a slightly higher-than-average R for f***s, with a paint-by-numbers plot and cartoonishly 1/2-dimensional villainess in Applegate (until the last five minutes when we're supposed to LIKE her), and yet there are laughs to be had just due to the throw-***t-at-the-wall approach. Among those throwing wildly with their comedic one-liner pitches, Kathryn Hahn's attempts were not bad, and Mila Kunis is certainly trying and acting well as she can. Ultimately, it shows how the writers of the Hangover (""trilogy"") are basically one trick ponies, if that, and perhaps they should leave their scripts with more capable, actual directors next time (not that I can see too many doing wonders with this script).It's shockingly safe ultimately, which with a title like this and outlook that's all ""hell with being a suburban soccer mom"" you'd hope it could come with more edge and less illogic than this has even in such a silly comedic world (i.e. the supermarket scene and something like how Kunis is able to have her ex's car all this time took me out of the movie, and it shouldn't have).",Bad Moms,4651520

And I do think I have a good sense of humor so that can not be the problem. The problem with Bad Moms is that the humor is so childish. And without being a sexist this movie is just a chick flick. Not that women have no sense of humor, far from that, but besides an audience of female teenagers I can't see other people enjoying this movie. The story is also really lame. They try to be funny but it just doesn't work. The acting is okay though. They're clearly not the worst thing in this movie. If I gave it a three it's for Mila Kunis, who is a beautiful women.

Really !!! Is this the state of modern women?this movie portrays that not caring about children and husband is a cool thing to do.What a terrible movie.

43,pamtha,Wish I could give negative score. Spoiler alert,1/10,27 November 2016,"I believe anyone involved with the production of this movie should be required to pay damages to those who wasted even 5 minutes having their minds polluted with this drivel. If you removed the near constant crude comments about sex and sexual organs as well as the profanity there would be maybe 15 minutes left of the show. The men are characterized as morons, the 'moms' as clueless, disorganized wimps except for the female co-star. She is a sexually aggressive piranha with no filter. If the part had been played by a man who groped and made sexually suggestive comments towards women you'd see women up in arms crying about sexism. They would be digging in their purses for their therapist's emergency phone numbers five minutes in. But it's okay for a female lead to portray this and men should be okay with it? Double standard there? The 'children' in the show are portrayed as disrespectful and patronizing towards their parents with no consequences. I've been searching for an appropriate description of this show and it is 'mind filth'. I do believe this is the worst movie I have ever seen. Ever.

Because it felt like this person had no idea how life works and seems to believe that everything come your way perfectly. Real-life link: nothing to reflect upon, everyone knows that moms would do almost everything when it comes to their kids. The movie gives nothing more beyond this idea. Everyone is a bad mom? Depends what you call ""bad"". It seemed like this movie called imperfection bad. It is not being a bad mom if you don't do your kids homework or you don't cook them breakfast. That's pretty normal, in fact doing those things is being a bad mom. Let your kid grow. And were they serious when the kids left Mila because she stopped spoiling them? So now kids, blackmail moms so that they become perfect? Oh and also, in the end the Gwendolyn becomes their friend because she has a private plane. Friendship can be bought so easily, seriously? Plausibility: Zero. Life is not as superficial and easy as this movie shows. You husband cheats on you? Great, I never loved him anyway and now lets go to therapist have a minor discussion in front of her so that she can conform that no way in this earth can our marriage be saved. Oh and also there is this hot single father that waits just around the corner for you when you leave your husband. And many many other ideas like that like the one when you get people to come to your party just because you send a text of you drinking wine or your husband suddenly obeys you just because you yell at him on the phone that you are going with friends to a school meeting.Character development: Gwendolyn is the only character that shows some growth, other just became more annoying. Acting: Mila is extremely bad. The scene when the coffee gets all over her, I could practically see her laughing. Why did she have the lead? Kristen Bell is a thousand times better. So many things wrong with this mainly because it simplifies life so much, there are scenes however that make you laugh and if you just want to kill some hours and have a laugh or too and need that switch off from reality wishing that things could be simpler, than this movie is for you.",Bad Moms,4651520
47,lark40,crazy lives of moms leaving to figure it all out in the world in which it doesn't owe you anything,10/10,2 September 2016,"i saw this in the cinema and I'm a single guy who like a chick flick now and again and its also not a action film were the end of the world is close at a hand its a fun comedy with great characters and With perfect back to school timing Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell and Kathryn Hahn rock up to the multiplexes and force their target market to take a long, hard look at their own parenting skills - and then hopefully give themselves a pat on the back. Some have described Bad Moms as a female Hangover - it's written and directed by the duo who penned that comedy classic - but that's a bit wide of the mark. Yes, it's got plenty of the same s*x-and-swearing shenanigans, but it has a much bigger heart - and a message in this 1hr 40min Comedy which has laughs which is fun lots of swear words so its not for kids there's is 3 against 3 here the good moms gone bad and feisty When three overworked and under-appreciated moms are pushed beyond their limits, they ditch their conventional responsibilities for a jolt of long overdue freedom, fun, and comedic self-indulgence so as we see Mila Kunis ..character Amy finding her husband doing a bad deed live online she gets him to leave Amy has a seemingly perfect life - a great marriage, over-achieving kids, beautiful home and a career. However she's over-worked, over-committed and exhausted to the point that she's about to snap she joins forces with 2 other moms Kathryn Hahn who plays a character called Carla a wild child adult who learned how to booty after her husband left and is Amy role model and kirsten bell playing kiki who is a lightweight and geeky but plays a funny role of learning the ropes in the bar on how to pick up guys and there bedrooms antics quest to liberate themselves from conventional responsibilities - going on a wild, un-mom-like binges chatting up guys who don't want family responsibilities talking like moms and parties and unconventional moms teaching their kids moms cant do everything and there there kids learn a lot because the parents need a lot of long overdue freedom, fun and self-indulgence - putting them on a collision course with PTA Queen Bee Gwendolyn and her clique of devoted perfect moms. but the head of the PTA and her clan Christina Applegate ..plays a boring but fun character . Gwendolyn who has her hand in everything in the school andJada Pinkett Smith character Stacy who loves her one liners Annie Mumolo character Vicky these 3 do everything in their power to stop the 3 wild adults from gong to the dark side but it happens as Amy chats naturally Jay Hernandez character Jessie Harkness who is keeps Amy sane this film has a great soundtrack to boot with a song called shut up and dance at the house party as Amy flies around in her husband sports car but cool her kids are learning not to stress out over there mom doing ever her dog with a helmet on the car lots of women kissing its hard not to dislike this film and there is a message in hear of look after things and not take advantage of your loved ones i gave it this film is a big hit in my view i give it 10/10",Bad Moms,4651520

She throws out her husband Mike who cheated online. She's the oldest person at work. Her boss Dale Kipler and co-workers are all young millennials who dismiss her work ethic. She has enough of PTA president Gwendolyn James (Christina Applegate) and quits. She is befriended by inappropriate single mom Carla Dunkler (Kathryn Hahn) and homeschooling Kiki (Kristen Bell). The three new friends become bad moms.It is loads of inappropriate fun when the ladies are being bad moms. There is a life lesson aspect that sometimes get wonky. Nothing gets derailed but the wild times are more fun. Kathryn Hahn continues to be a hilarious lady and she's great here. Kristen Bell is playing against type a little. Mila Kunis started off with some problems. In fact, her start reminded me of that bad Sarah Jessica Parker movie but it got much funnier relatively quick.

The 1hr 40min movie raced by, and I was disappointed when it ended.

52,namashi_1,A Fun Watch with Splendid Performances!,7/10,17 November 2016,"Its sad that Hilary Clinton lost the elections recently, because women empowerment is the need of the day! And with 'Bad Moms', you just can't stop rooting for them! Build on a good heart, this recent box-office smash hit, is a fun watch with all of its performers putting in their very best. A Good Laugh is guaranteed!'Bad Moms' Synopsis: When three overworked and under-appreciated moms are pushed beyond their limits, they ditch their conventional responsibilities for a jolt of long overdue freedom, fun, and comedic self-indulgence.'Bad Moms' is about Mothers & how they manage to raise their kids, sometimes their husbands & also run the house on their merit. And if you push their buttons beyond a point, they sure will break loose & party like a mother. The film nicely blends some really funny humor with its heartfelt message to all the mothers around the world. Of course, the film isn't perfect, but its intention with the touch of comedy, do the trick.Jon Lucas & Scott Moore's Screenplay is good, although the sub-plots (particularly Mila running for PTA elections), don't engage much. Nonetheless, its fun watching these moms have fun. Lucas & Moore's Direction, on the other-hand, is well-done.Another prime reason why 'Bad Moms' works so well is because of its splendid cast. Mila Kunis is absolutely fantastic as the central mom here, delivering an affecting & genuinely lovable performance from start to end. Kristen Bell melts your heart with her cute portrayal of a timid women, while Kathryn Hahn is unabashedly brash all through & also brings in the best laughs. Christina Applegate is terrific as the antagonist. She's deliciously mean! Jada Pinkett Smith & Annie Mumolo as Applegate's vamps do well, but I wish they got as much scope as Applegate. Jay Hernandez is in fine form after a long time. Clark Duke is first-rate, as always.On the whole, 'Bad Moms' is definitely worth your time.",Bad Moms,4651520

The acting was sub par, the delivery of the ""joke"" always failing to hit timing, the plot was dated and dull and t he jokes where tired. By the end I felt simply irritated, did the film really need to say either the word Mom or a crass name for the female genitals in EVERY sentence, I believe not.Quite simply, horrid!!

Half way through the film they decided to try and shoehorn in a moral to the story. Unfortunately every time a point was made, it was duly undermined/contradicted around 10 minutes later.

Basically: Father's are idiots who don't care about the kids and take mothers for granted. It's OK to dispose of your family so you can sleep with a good looking parent. Kids have no real value and no long term emotions, if you consider yourself a good mom you can fix it all. This was utter garbage with terrible actresses.

59,CANpatbuck3664,"Surprisingly Raunchy and Completely Hilarious, Bad Moms is Carried by the Chemistry of it's 3 Lead Actresses",8/10,1 August 2016,"I was really surprised where they put Bad Moms on the summer schedule. Going up against Jason Bourne was pretty ballsy let alone movies like Star Trek: Beyond or Ghostbusters. But the phrase ""counter programming"" comes to mind. Putting in a smaller movie with potential beside a juggernaut is slowly becoming more and more successful. The one that I remember first was Kingsman: The Secret Service being released against Fifty Shades of Grey and Kingsman performed really well despite all the attention that Fifty Shades got. It seems like the same strategy worked for Bad Moms, providing that alternative option for people who weren't interested in Bourne. After being disappointed with Ghostbusters, I'm really glad I got to see this, I laughed a lot and was impressed with what Bad Moms was able to do.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* Amy (Mila Kunis) is a mom that has to do everything. Her two kids Jane and Dylan are completely dependent on her. She shuttles them to school, does their homework for them, and takes them to all their extra curricular activities. On top of this she works a part time job which is actually a full time job because her boss Dale (Clark Duke) completely takes advantage of her. Lastly, her deadbeat husband Mike (David Walton) is having an affair online and she kicks him out. She's completely under-appreciated and she also has to deal with the judgmental head of the PTA Gwendolyn (Christina Applegate) and her cronies Stacy (Jada Pinkett Smith), and Vicky (Annie Mumolo).On the particular day we join her, she has a really terrible day and after they call an emergency PTA meeting where they go through what they can't put in items for the bake sale (trust me the list is just ridiculous). Amy decides to quit after being called out for being late to the meeting. She heads to a bar and bumps into Carla (Kathryn Hahn). Carla is the mom that no one wants to associate with, she ignores her kid and tries to bang the husbands of the other moms. Another mom shows up named Kiki (Kristen Bell) who followed Amy there. Kiki is the mom with 4 kids who doesn't have any time to herself and was inspired by Amy's speech. They drink together and bond over the difficulties of being a mom today. They decide to be bad moms and after a drunken trip to the grocery store, they resolve to try things a little differently going forward.Going into this movie if you see the trailers, it's not exactly the movie that gets advertised. It looks like something similar to The Hangover or 21 and Over (which Jon Lucas and Scott Moore also wrote and directed) and while the movie is pretty raunchy, I was surprised how much development went into Amy's character. There's more than a few scenes where you see Amy bonding with her kids and trying to do the right thing and it actually works pretty well. She's a good character, you're with her when she finally gets so sick of trying to keep up with these unrealistic goals and she never goes too far when she tries to teach her kids to be self-reliant. It can be hard for movies to strike that balance between dirty comedy and proper character development (Unfinished Business missed on it completely) but Bad Moms did a decent job with it.Getting into the actually comedy, there were so many laugh out loud moments. The language in it is pretty bad and they aren't afraid to say whatever they want or make fun of whatever they want. The upside is that for the majority of it, it mostly works. Does everything work 100%? No, you can tell there was a fair amount of ad libbing and not everything is the gold standard. I would say probably around 75% of the jokes made me laugh and for something that could have easily been a throwaway, for me it was more than enough.The real strength of Bad Moms is how well Mila, Kathryn and Kristen work together and they all give great performances. This is the best job I've seen Mila do in a comedy in a while. She has the chops to do the dramatic stuff too and although she initially seemed like odd casting, she was great. Kathryn Hahn finally found the right movie to showcase herself, she's the mouthiest and the loudest of the moms but she steals most scenes she's in. Kristen Bell played her role pitch perfect. I've talked about before how versatile she is, she probably could have played Mila's role but she hits the right notes and rounds out the main 3 well. Christina Applegate was also good as Gwendolyn, the movie gives her some humanity at the end which was a nice touch.I did have small problems with this movie. The whole subplot with Amy running to be the PTA president was a little corny and they make her husband Mike just such a loser it wasn't really believable. In the end though, this was a pretty solid comedy and it delivered on almost all fronts. I don't think a lot was expected from Bad Moms and I would congratulate the team behind it for delivering an impressive low-brow comedy for women that men can enjoy as well.",Bad Moms,4651520

The story involves three Moms who feel over stressed and decide to blow off steam in an unconventional way. It is filled with unfunny jokes that the trio can't seem to ""pull off"" (no pun intended) , without looking self conscious . When this occurs the audience cannot help but feel self conscious themselves, so there is a lot of squirming.The best example of this type of uncomfortable humor is when Kathryn Hahn delivers penis joke lines that are bawdy, but go over like a led balloon. It doesn't help that she scrunches up that FACE to the point that her eyes disappear completely, either. If a beautiful actress delivered the lines it might have been different, but Kathryn Hahn? Hollywoods "" go to"" girl to play the homely friend? I don't mean it in a bad way, but Kathryn Hahn making penis jokes is like if Adrian Brody was cast to deliver lines about cliteromegaly; Awkward!

62,diac228,The True Feminism Film of Summer 2016,8/10,15 August 2016,"Ghostbusters was slaughtered and fed to the wolves in terms of box office because the feminist twang to the franchise was not well-received in the least bit. Some complained it was pointless, some complained it was just milking a franchise that is heavy in nostalgia, and others complained that it was pandering to the female-driven audience as opposed to the fanbase that had supported the franchise in the first place. Despite the good critic reviews, it became a major loss for Sony, and killed any hopes for a sequel.Bad Moms on the other hand is the little summer film that could, taking a $20 million budget and already matching that amount after the first weekend. And with strong word-of-mouth and good reviews it continues to make decent money in a crowded summer schedule. This film also has a heavy feminism touch, yet hasn't received the male-bashing you've been seeing from Ghostbusters. And that's because the film from the ground up was made for moms, made for female millennials, and doesn't hold anything back and keeps the focus on the ladies.Led by the screen writing duo that penned the clever original Hangover flick, Bad Moms is a cinematic stress ball for mothers around the world. It follows a trio of ladies fed up with their stressful lives and start rebelling against the norm. It starts a revolution amongst the community which counters the strict clockwork ways of the PTA---leading to a culture clash against its leader. The plot isn't anything drastically revolutionary, but it has a lot to say about modern society's difficult expectations for mothers.With the plot being slightly thin, it gives plenty of room for the main cast to go vulgar, go nuts, go raw, before ultimately getting the point across. And Kunis, Kristin Bell, and especially Kathryn Hahn knocks it out of the park with timing, delivery, and a good range of emotions to boot. Mila Kunis' character rises from humble soccer mom into a wild force of nature that results in crazy parties, rebellion against her children and deadbeat husband, and even nachos for breakfast (my hero). Step aside men as most of the focus was on the relationships between mother and child, with men popping in only once in a while. Then toss several funny scenarios, a wild cheap wine scene, and a couple fun cameos, and you'll be seldom bored at the chaos that emerges once the second act rolls in.This movie definitely isn't perfect. The tone gets slightly uneven, the soundtrack is overindulgent, and the final moments doesn't quite match the comedic wrecking ball of the second half, but if you are a mother this is your guilty pleasure. The cast is too fun, the movie doesn't slow down, and it gets unapologetically vulgar and uncut and doesn't let go.Mothers: Bad Moms tailors to you, speaks to you, represents you, and challenges societal beliefs held against you. And prepare for the final scene once the credits roll in---it wraps up the motherhood themes perfectly. You can't just switch genders on a film and try to staple a feminism theme and expect it to work---you need to fully commit to your audience and also explain what your 21st century movement is all about. Otherwise it feels like a gimmick. Ghostbusters was simply trying to ride the wave of feminism. Bad Moms actually has something to say, which is why ultimately amongst the flaws and hard-R rating it actually works.",Bad Moms,4651520

64,chimera3,Worth the Watch,10/10,8 September 2017,"In all fairness, I do not see what it is wrong with this movie. Yes, I will be the first to admit that I had a few reservations about it after finding out that the guys behind ""The Hangover"" were responsible for the creation of it. After watching it a few times, I couldn't stop watching it. In my opinion, it is fall-down funny. Not everyone may agree and it doesn't matter to me. I have watched it with my brothers and mother and we couldn't stop laughing. I know that everyone is entitled to their opinion, but this movie was not meant to be taken seriously.In a nutshell, it can best be described as an R-rated ""Parenthood."" That's it. To make a long story short, being a parent is messy. There are no such things as ""perfect parents."" That's all this movie is trying to say. Everyone makes mistakes. That is it, that is all. Granted it would never win any Academy Awards, it is, as my title states, worth the watch. Watch it when you're having a bad day. If you don't like it, find something else.

66,keniwhat,A few laughs but ultimately sexist. Or lazy.,4/10,30 August 2016,"This movie is a comedy with a simplistic message that is let down in a number of ways. The set up for the women to choose to be bad moms instead of trying to be good ones and failing regardless is quite weak but somewhat excusable for structural reason: the woman with two kids (Amy) has a full time job and a useless cheating husband. The stay-at-home mom (Kikki) has four kidsl under five. The other woman (Carla) just seems to be useless, but that is part of her charm as the comic relief. There are some good laughs when they initially choose to go 'bad', but it does not really go anywhere from there and instead descends into predictable fare. Amy comes out on top against her battle with the villain of the story (Gwendolyn), manages to separate amicably from her cheating husband, sees improvements in her son's attitude and ultimately manages gets the guy (the hot single dad) as the icing on the cake. A realisation that the role of a mom requires her to be 'good' is the ultimate message of the journey the women undertake and that 'good' may need a bit of redefinition. All that is fine but it is a little tainted by the overly sexist nature of the movie. All the male characters are negative. Amy's husband is a cheat, Kiki's a bully, the headmaster has relinquished his power, the gym teacher no spine, Amy's son is useless (partly her creation) and even Gwendolyn is only the villain she is because her husband is an embezzling cheat and thus yet another victim of male betrayal. The only non-dick is the hot dad but he is merely a meek sex object, devoid of real personality. There is a scene where a fearful woman only turns up to the meeting because Carla threatened to seduce her husband that is delivered well from a comic perspective. But it might propose the notion that all that men need to stray is opportunity. So, even male characters that are only hinted at are negative (think Gwendolyn's embezzling husband). Hence the movie is ultimately sexist. Or just lazy.",Bad Moms,4651520
67,daemonyx,RELAX and enjoy the film!,8/10,24 October 2016,"I see a lot of PC criticisms, judging, and bashing in these reviews, which is disappointing since you all clearly missed the message. This movie is about the struggles that mothers face in judgment by society, other family members, their children, and their peers. Not to mention self-loathing from guilt they feel at the slightest misstep, thereby labelling themselves as ""bad moms"". The movie shines a harsh light on a society where in a 2 income household, it's common for today's mom to LITERALLY be run off her feet. And with the fantasy of some clever story writing and endearing characters, the film manages to show what life could be like if moms would give each other, themselves, and even their kids a well deserved break. Laugh with them, cry with them, celebrate with them as they go on their mom adventures, and just relax and have FUN. Also, be sure to watch the initial rolling of the credits, you'll be pleasantly surprised! :)

73,akcsj,Female liberation is all about getting drunk and penises.,1/10,22 January 2017,"A terrible movie; disjointed, unfunny and insulting to both women, who are presented as puerile passive/aggressive victims, and men who are either vacuous jocks, selfish idiots and/or cyphers. The movie doesn't have an original, amusing or insightful bone in its indeterminable length. Watching this movie was like having a kidney stone.The movie made quite a profit. One can only assume it was due to the presence of the word 'bad' in it's title. Previous movies with 'bad' in their title such as Bad Santa and Bad teacher were masterpieces compared to this rubbish.Despite its faults the movie still obviously takes itself seriously. It's theme of female assertiveness is meant to be profound but is depicted in the movie by the 'bad' moms getting drunk and molesting men and generally acting like 15 year old males supposedly do as shown in broad teenage angst movies.I repeat this movie is terrible.",Bad Moms,4651520
74,schwarzmd,Funny,8/10,21 January 2017,"My wife rented this, otherwise I would not have thought to watch it. I must say I was pleased and have to admit this was very funny. It takes a lot to make me laugh. The writers clearly had a good story with decent character building and sub-plots to keep the movie going. It was not a predictable, typical movie. The comedy was funny in the vein of Tina Fey/Amy Pohler and I honestly thought I would be seeing that caliber of comedians. I was surprised to find Mila Kunis as the lead in this level of a comedy. Obviously having a veteran like Applegate helped, however Christina's character was not the typical leading comedic role. This actually was a nice touch, and should have given the movie higher ratings then I have seen. In fact, I am troubled by the less than stellar reviews by the users on this site. It really takes a great deal for me to provide an 8 especially for a comedy, and this movie earned it.

Some people will think this is hilarious, some others will call it despicable (especially with the language used in this one!). It's kind of like Sex and the City - The Mom Edition. Also boiled down a lot and simplified even more.But to be entertained you don't always need a lot. Great villains would be great (something this movie lacks, giving us stereotypical performances from the Husband and rival mom), but even that can be neglected unless you are expecting a masterpiece in comedy. That's not what you'll be getting here. You will be getting a movie that is raunchy and predictable, but with very likable main characters (our 3 friends by chance).

79,thesar-2,Bad Mom's Night Out,9/10,13 November 2016,"Why the HELL wasn't she running in 2016? She has my vote!I would say while 2016 has been MUCH better to us in regards to higher quality cinema than 2015, Bad Moms would be a perfect double feature with a movie just squeezed out at the end of 2015: Sisters. To sum up the entire movie review, if you liked Sisters, you'd LOVE Bad Moms. and spoiler, I even love Bad Moms more than Sisters. So, make sure you schedule Sisters first just to end on this high note.I rate this movie very high because I did have a blast, laughed a ton and felt the heart – enough to tear up at the ending, but it's not 100% perfect. It's the movie people want this kind of movie to be and with that wish, you get the standard tropes and predictable scenes. To me, once you grab me, those don't matter. Movies still can work with clichés and obvious heartfelt scenes as long as they established themselves upfront with good writing, believable acting and a good time. Bad Moms did that in spades.The movie's not very complex. A mother is doubting her ability as a parent thanks to society's teaching of being a perfect momor mostly thanks to our antagonist, PTA President Bitch Gwendolyn. But, a snowball of a bad day turns our heroine into the truth of what all the school's mothers really are. Against all oddsshe has to become real.Truly, I laughed out loud many times, but also saw the heart and realness to these actresses. Sure, there were dumb men, and the ""perfect"" man, but neither I nor the writers bash men in what could've been a ""Mom's Rule! Dad's Drool!"" script. We could empower the women without having to consider them just one side of the sexes.I truly enjoyed this ride. It's not just about girl-power here. It's about learning to live your life, the life you feel you missed out on to be a parent and balancing being a parent and human. Plus, it's no holds barred on the language and innuendos. Can always appreciate that.that, and always gotta love me some Jay Hernandez. Man. I've had a thing for him for over a decade. What a manI digress. See this! (Plus Sisters with Amy Poehler and Tina Fey. Grab a bottle of shitty wine, pop in Sisters and then watch this. You will NOT regret it.)***Final thoughts: Last Christmas, or was it Mother's Day or my mom's birthday? I can't recall. I bought my mother the DVD of Moms' Night Out. I heard a solid recommendation from a movie critic about it and I knew it would be a nice Christian movie for her. I watched it prior to gifting it to her, and I actually did like it. It was refreshing to see a woman's night out on the town film that had no raunch to it. Not that I am opposed to that – once again, I recommend the extremely raunchy Sisters and Bad Moms. But, that movie worked on its own showing it didn't need all the R-rated stuff. That all saidif you want that, plus true adult fare, see this. It's that movie on real-time with the world. Moms' Night Out is what they want the world to be, Bad Moms is what the world is.",Bad Moms,4651520

She is amusing and keeps the film chugging along, helped by the pacing and music which also move the film along nicely. There is a good amount of gags, I certainly enjoyed watching it.Away from Kunis (Amy), you have a whole host of recognizable faces. Kristen Bell (Kiki) and Kathryn Hahn (Agath..sorry, Carla) are pleasant in their respective roles, Hahn is borderline irritating but I'd say she sticks to the right side just about. Christina Applegate (Gwendolyn) and Jada Pinkett Smith (Stacy) also feature, as does Wendell Pierce (Daryl). Shoutout, also, to 'The Walking Dead' alum Ann Mahoney.There are also sweet end credit scenes. It's a lot better than 2017's 'Fun Mom Dinner' too, no doubt about it.

82,drawnsupreme,Predictable Girl Power and Little Too Raunchy,5/10,16 May 2019,"Bad Moms has a few humorous moments here and there, but the movie was predictable and sometimes felt like it was a little excessive with the raunchiness and curse words, which gets boring and predictable quickly. Mila Kunis did a great job but this movie should have tried to be more creative and different from other similar comedy movies.This is an R-rated comedy for the most part, that can't decide whether to be excessively vulgar or take the 'feel good' family-friendly route, so it tries to juggle both, leaving you with a 'I've already seen this movie' feeling at the end.The script wasn't very fun and entertaining. Bad Moms could have probably been much more successful with light-hearted humor and a PG or PG-13 rating. The issue here is that we've already seen excessively raunchy R-rated comedies from Seth Rogen, Jonah Hill, Will Ferrell, and countless other great comedians - and those films worked at the time.

I love Kristen Bell and Mila Kunis, and maybe this movie is relatable for rich celebrity moms like them, but for regular Americans? I don't think so.First of all, can Hollywood stop pretending that millennial moms don't spank their kids (and they portray it as a bad thing, even though it's been proven almost a century ago that kids who weren't spanked behave better in the long run and are healthier as adults)? Or that they're all sweet and perfect all the time as moms? Or that they were the first generation to feel pressured to be perfect mothers all the time? Any time a new generation grows up and are old enough to take over the movie industry, they act like the pressure of being a perfect mom is a new concept, and try to make their generation look like martyrs for the next generation, always portrayed in this, ""Oh, poor us. We all do so much for our kids and have to be perfect all the time! We're the nicest generation of parents ever! Our parents didn't have societal pressure to be perfect! Only we do!"" I don't know. It just seems...self indulgent, portraying themselves as martyrs and as being the only victims in the world. The movie just feels like a circle jerk of moms who want to feel like their generation has it harder than everyone else and have this ""I sacrifice so much. I'm such an angel."" Mentality.I also wish they had incorporated actual problems that modern middle class moms deal with, rather than just say, ""Oh, you shouldn't have to do your son's science project."" Huh? They act like that's a normal thing that most moms are doing. Do they actually think this is relatable?Or, ""OMG. The worst thing about being a mom is dropping your kids off at school or attending bake sales. So relatable! Am I right?"" Aw. These poor women! Too bad school buses don't exist, right? And too bad all moms in the world are apparently legally required to participate in every school event ever, and they can't just reign from PTA. My mom is only slightly older than most of the women in the cast, and she never volunteered for all these school events. Did anyone care? No. Did someone throw a temper tantrum about it? No. Why? Because most moms don't do it in the first place, which is fine. Most moms are busy or simply don't want to. But the movie acts like doing something that's literally so normal is something revolutionary and rare. It's really not that deep.Mommy shaming is real, and I know that being a good mom is hard, but the way the movie portrays it feels so tone deaf and stupid, it almost seems to invalidate the legitimate complaints that normal and real moms have.The only thing this movie has going for it are the lead actresses. All are great, but this movie was trashy and failed at being relatable.",Bad Moms,4651520
85,karia-43126,"The rating does NOT do this movie Justice, just as the trailer didn't! It is amazing!",10/10,31 July 2016,"Please don't listen to the negative reviews !! I had no expectations for this movie . I went, expecting mediocre based on the trailer . It has by far exceeded my expectations !! I went with my mother, sister, GRANDMOTHERS , and 2 friends . We all equally loved it !! I have not laughed so hard during a movie in a long time. It was a great change! Usually I feel like the funny parts are all shown in the trailer. NOT the case here. If you are uptight , you may not like some of the crude and perverted HUMOR. This is not for the boring prude type that finds everything ""innappropriate"" . There really isn't any nudity..(one extremely small scenes) Most is language and sex related talk . However, if you can are fun, have a sense of humor , and enjoy this type, you will LOVE it. My mom loved the movie Bridesmaids and it was her favorite prior. This was much funnier! Much better! Yes there are a few things that were cheesy I felt like in the very beginning .. but honestly this IS supposed to be a little over the top. It's a comedy! It was a great laugh. Laughed the most during this movie than most I can remember . Also had a few heartfelt moments. I am going to see it again with other friends and my husband. My mom is going to see it again with my dad. So much better than I anticipated",Bad Moms,4651520
86,kirbylee70-599-526179,Emphasis On The Word Bad,2/10,22 November 2016,"BAD MOMS could be the perfect example of what is wrong with movies today. Rather than allow a combined effort by producer and director to meld together to make something memorable or at least worth watching more than once, studios now seem controlled by corporate boardrooms who eye only the return on investment, judging by cookie cutter playbooks rather than creativity. Watching a movie like this you have to wonder if they ever looked at the script or just cut and paste moment from various movies changing the names of characters as they went.The movie revolves around Amy (Mila Kunis), an overworked and under-appreciated mom of two. She works full time yet is paid part time by a group of millennials more concerned with the going to concerts than working, has a work at home mortgage broker husband who doesn't lift a finger to help and her two kids are the stereotypical youngsters, one an overachiever fretting over college in in 7 years and the other and underachiever who is happy with a D. Amy is perpetually late to everything and frazzled by her life.One night she catches her husband masturbating to a woman on screen and discovers he's been doing so for 10 months so she kicks him out. After a late PTA meeting where she says she will no longer participate by their rules she goes out for a drink and makes friend with 2 other moms also fed up. Carla (Kathryn Hahn) is the wild one, the do what she wants, ignore her kid party animal who sleeps with any and every one she can. Kiki (Kristen Bell) is the timid home keeper who abides by her husband's rules all the time going so far as to iron his underwear while trying to corral 4 terror inspiring children. So naturally they get drunk and have a good time.The next morning Amy decides she's had enough. No more perfect mom or at least pretense to be so. She tells the kids to make their own breakfast. She drops them at school with Arby's for lunch. She goes to breakfast alone, is called by her boss asking where she is and when told to come in tells him she only gets paid to work 3 days a week and it's her day off. And finally she faces off the prim, proper and all controlling picture of mom perfection, PTA President Gwendolyn (Christina Applegate), at the latest bake sale. This sets in motion a challenge for the lead of the PTA between the two which forms most of the rest of the film.What we end up with is another gross out crude frolic in fun according to corporate execs. It's not enough that nearly every teen movie these days has to have kids overindulging in sex, drugs and alcohol, the time has arrived when we want to encourage the same from parents in an attempt to show just how cool they are too. Granted life can be stressful and you want to cut lose now and then but not to the extremes on display here. Soccer moms don't rally around a non-conformists by going to her house, getting ripped and kissing one another.I kept expecting to see Seth Rogen or Will Ferrell show up at any moment while watching this film. It was like someone said see how these movies are made, let's make one of those movies but instead of guys put women in the same roles. The whole time they ignore the fact that none of those movies have done major business like they did when they first began being made and were unlike anything around at the time. They are now the cliché films that were attacking cliché films when they were made. They are predictable, lame and unfunny. At least now we can say women can be the same way.That's another troubling thing about this movie. After years of feminists trying to prove they are equal to or better than men (and in many ways they can be) it feels as if that's all been tossed aside to show they can be just as worthless too. The concept of Amy taking back control of her life here may sound like a good idea but in this story it just makes her look like she is more concerned with herself than her kids even though the movie tries to make you feel otherwise by the last 20 minutes.Characters are cardboard cut outs here rather than fleshed out individuals. The jerk dad, the frazzled mom, the uptight authority figure, the hunk you immediately fall in love and bed with. They've all been seen before. It just feels like they took these characters from teen films and aged them just a tad, enough so they're now adults but not too old so the kids can still relate to them.It saddens me these days to consider the output being made on film. In search of blockbusters or quick return on investments Hollywood has tossed aside any hope of movies that will stand the test of time. With the exception of a few that have been outstanding can you name movies you've seen this past year that you plan to revisit in the future? I can't. But I can tell give you at least 10 movies made from the 30s to the 80s that I could. I just hope that young people can truly realize the fast that they're being sold product instead of entertainment. I fear that they're not.",Bad Moms,4651520
87,kimsoaresoahu,Movie was funny,7/10,24 October 2016,"I don't know what movie the others that have written a review watched. My husband and I thought this movie was FUNNY! If you are truly a busy mom that over extends herself, you so would appreciate this movie! I could relate to just about everything in Amy's life as a busy mom. Husband just siting on the couch doing nothing, the feeling of being judged for not participating in PTA or volunteering for school fundraisers and rushing my kids out of the car because I'm running late to a meeting. Eating in the car is something I have to do all the time, because we're always in a rush.I gave this movie 7 stars because it did get a little too raunchy and over the top. It started off funny, but kind of got ridiculous, from being a great mom to a horrible party mom. I can understand the occasional breakdown, but where were the kids the whole time? AND the uncircumcised P, that was just weird too. I think that should have been a scene that was cut and added to the end while credits were rolling!This was a comedy and comedies are usually over exaggerated and some do turn weird. But if you relate to the material that's really what makes a comedy so funny! I would watch it again!",Bad Moms,4651520
88,asrichmond,Terrible Movie!,1/10,12 April 2018,"This movie was stupid and not funny. Poor excuse for a comedy. Did not like Mila Kinas in this movie. She has an old, hard look about her now. Don't waste your time watching this crap of a movie! Wish there had been an option for 0 stars.

89,rgkarim,"Mom's the word in this stupid, silly, surprisingly moral filled movie",7/10,28 July 2016,"Moms, everyone at some point has had one in some shape or form. Our world today focuses on portraying these lovely women (and sometimes men) as either saints or monsters depending on the acts. Over the years the image of a mom has changed, often gearing towards being a perfect role model who does no wrong and should she make a mistake is cast as a cretin. However, tonight's film decides to explore a different venue, one that is certain to be entertaining to some audiences. Yes, I'm talking about Bad Moms, a comedy that is certain to start up online riots. Hi Robbie K here and I'm back with another review, let's get started. The GOOD  Delivers what's promised in the trailers  Short run time  Decent story with good morals  Good actingThis review is difficult to write, because I have to keep in mind the target audience the developers had in mind. If you haven't seen the trailers, then you might not know that Bad Moms is an over-the-top, ridiculous comedy geared towards moms, and guess what that is exactly what you get. If you were expecting something different, then you will be disappointed, but this movie certainly delivers the silliness promised. It's comedy is geared towards what many of my female friends joke about including sexual innuendos, superficial lust jokes, and more meme worthy quotes than you can count. Especially in the beginning, the movie is a one- stop joke box that draws as much stupidity as possible, which kept much of the audience laughing. While the comedy may not have been up my alley, to my surprise Bad Moms had a decent story. Again one shouldn't be surprised that the movie has a plot geared towards mothers and the issues they face. I myself began to roll my eyes at the cheesy drama of the plot and the emphasis on superficial things like sex, alcohol, and a bit of drugs. However, the second act packed that sentimental punch that really hooked me into the movie. The morals embedded in the over dramatic speeches and symphony laden sequences are very powerful and may teach significant others and kids an important lesson. I applaud the directors for being able to drive such a message in a comedy like this, but that certainly gained bonus points in my book. Again, mothers will feel this point the most, but those who have an open mind might feel it in your heart as well Another saving grace is the acting in this movie. I went in expecting really bad work to mold out of the word work and shallow talent. And in truth I kind of got what I expected, but also got some surprises. Mila Kunis did a nice job in this simplistic role, and was able to inject some depth into it. Kathryn Hahn is your number one comedy guru, doing nothing but acting like an ass and having a mouth to go with it. Kristen Bell iscute, but her character's awkwardness has a limited role of providing a few good lines and very empowering moment. As for the bad girls, well nothing really magical about this performance, other than yeah they are good at being a five-letter word for a dog. The BAD  Very lazy writing  Stupid  Not really uniqueThis is tough to write and not upset people, but I'll do my best. Yes, the movie does deliver what the trailer promised, but that doesn't mean it's the best quality when compared to other films. Bad Moms writing is essentially how many rants, shouts, and one-liner quotes can be fit in a ninety-minute run time. It's fun and enjoyable, but it certainly is lazy writing, especially once the F bombs and penis grenades are dropped. Sometimes these jokes are timed very well, or delivered in a manner that capitalizes the fun (thank you Kathryn Hahn). However, the sheen does dull after the tenth iteration and had me bored until the story picked up. The lack of cleverness also shows just how stupid the movie is as well. Something else that may cross the line is some of the more intense party moments our directors filmed (alcohol anyone). As such, the unique quality of this film is very lacking and quickly falls into the mediocre milieu that plagues the theaters these days. In addition, some of the comedy could be ""insulting"" to the more traditional member. Therefore exercise caution, pay attention to the rating, and avoid the movie if you are easily offended. The VerdictBad Moms is certainly not the best film to arrive at the silver screen, but it is also exactly what you expected from the trailers. The team certainly created a movie geared toward the mom audience and I have no doubt most in this category, and a few significant others, will laugh their heads off. Therefore I have to give points to the directors for delivering the promised laughs and story. However, it still is a very simplistic movie that does not contain anything really unique, nor the best comedy I have seen. It's just fun. Other than for a girl's night out, I cannot recommend this one for the theater, but certainly take a look at it on RedBox. My scores are: Comedy: 7.5-8.0 (because it delivers to its category) Movie Overall: 5.5-6.0",Bad Moms,4651520
90,Floated2,Feels forced for crude content,3/10,5 November 2017,"Bad Moms has a decent cast and the chemistry works among the lead actresses but overall the film tries too hard and forced in using overly sexual and crude content and for laughs and humor. Mila Kunis is very likable as the lead character as this was a good role for her, Kristen bell played her role well as for Katheryn Hanh was there for the crude and sexual jokes (most of which wore off and her act was not funny in the least). and Kr Deemed as a female version of the Hangover or slightly lesser version of Bridemaids, it is clear the intentions of Bad Moms was made due to those films being big successes. Though when we think of it, Bad Moms somewhat feels as an R-rated version of Mean Girls.Bad Moms was a surprise hit which is why the studios quickly greenlit a sequel an released it only one year later, however that doesn't mean the demand was such as high for a sequel. As many comedy films that are surprise or overachieving box office hits, their sequels usually end up under performing (in recent years- Ted 2, Neighbors 2). Overall the film isn't as funny as it could have been since a lot is forced and not very realistic, and the jokes do not stick. Predictable as well with a cop out type ending.",Bad Moms,4651520
91,gmonaco-39246,The New Age Female Gimick,1/10,23 November 2016,"What is the new age female gimmick? This movie has it in spades. Women that spew dick jokes and swear as much as they can for an hour and a half. When you go into a movie called ""Bad Moms"", you expect those moms to be genuinely bad, right? Bad Santa is about a genuinely bad man who works as a mall Santa and robs the malls in which he works. Even Bad Teacher, as shitty as it was, is about a genuinely bad teacher. So what is so bad about these moms? They say bad words. They make sex jokes. One of the moms is a slut of which we never see her actually act on. They get drunk and make a mess in a grocery store. They tell a few people off. They make their kids make their own breakfast. They go to a movie when all the kids are taken care of. It's like a Disney movie with F-words.

92,chas437,"Feminism Trumps Comedy, Again",1/10,28 May 2017,"This marks a new low in terms of screen writing and comedic failure.Again, we're hit over the head with the idea that mothers should shun their maternal responsibilities and behave like frat boys. This is deemed acceptable behavior by feminists. We even see some presumably Muslims mothers thrown in the mix, no doubt for the sake of diversity and inclusion. We even gets jabs at males and whites, so it seems the target audience is low-minded SJWs.Third wave feminism is the opposite of humor. This stinker proves it. Mila Kunis is officially a has been, and Katheryn Hawn, a genuinely funny woman/actress is totally wasted in a hideously predictable role.Its becoming more and more clear that movies are intentionally dumbed-down these days, I can't believe a writer would intentionally write such a pile of excrement.",Bad Moms,4651520
93,emad_eldin,Highschool flick for adults,5/10,12 August 2016,"I did not have any expectations when I decided to go to Bad moms, and I came out indifferent. The movie has a plot that has been used numerous times in many high school flicks that you'd think Hollywood should start feel that it was overused, but not this time.Basically, the movie is about the PTA president (Christina Applegate) who is a bully controlling perfectionist freak, when the not so perfect Mila Kunis decides to stand against her tyranny and overthrow her to become president, with some subplots that could have been more meaningful if the movie hasn't tackled them with such shallowness, like the so much pressure on parents to become perfect by even making up stuff that do not benefit the kids at all, and the unbalanced relationships among others, and the 80s born generation who is now in the struggle for balance between adulthood and youth.The movie had some laughs in it, but all in all it was not worth the time, had you replaced the moms with high school kids it would've been the worst movie in years, but the story would've worked just as good.And finally, if you are looking for the movie to win the Oscar for most characters flip 180 degrees for absolutely no decent reason and no build up whatsoever, this movie is your champ, I think the crew members probably changed from evil to good too because this must be an outbreak in the set or something.",Bad Moms,4651520
94,SeamusMacDuff,"Bad Moms, Bad Movie, Bad Time",2/10,3 February 2018,"This movie is bad on just about every level: concept, acting, writing, consistency. It's supposed to show how tough life is for moms these days but can't decide i it wants to be a raunch-fest, a family thing, or have a moral. A single mom (whose husband is a boob), a stay-at-home mom (whose husband is a tyrant), and a sex-crazed skank mom (no hubby) get together and - what exactly?They decide unfunny Mila Kunis needs to get laid so they transform her and go bar-hopping where one after another hot guy disconnects until hot single Latin father and she connect for the most chaste sex scene on film. (The real problem with female raunch films is that they don't want to get naked. Shades of 'Sarah Marshall', also with Bell and Kunis and also unfunny.) Hann is wholly unlikeable; a male character with the same characteristics would be decried. Think Rob Corrddry. Kunis gets fired, she can't reconcile with her ex-, her kids have problems - but she faces them all with the same bland non-angst.There's the evil PTA that somehow runs the school with the ""perfect"" moms as counterpoint which is so over the top that it's parody. What, no working moms have it together, or have good husbands? The manifesto speech at the end undercuts everything but of course the bond of momhood trumps all and they all fly off in a private jet. (What about the kids? Oh, moms gotta be moms).Save your money and your time.",Bad Moms,4651520
