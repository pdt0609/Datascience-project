0,MatthewMichaelHoffman,One word to describe my experience watching this movie: Serotonin,10/10,12 August 2022,"SCORE: 10/10I have one word to describe my experience watching this movie: Serotonin. Even when I was completely sobbing in complete depression, I still could not help but marvel at the beauty of what I was experiencing. When this movie first came out, I remember leaving the theater so frustrated at how it ended. How could they build up such a beautiful bond between Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone's characters just for them to rip my young heart out by them not ending up together? I was furious and never went back to watch it...until now.You know who I can thank for that? Nicole Kidman. I am an AMC A-List member and every single time her ad plays before a movie I see the short clip from La La Land. This movie tackles so many deep topics about life, some of which I am in the heat of battle with. There is so much pressure to hold a steady job in order to survive in today's world. In Sebastian's case, he took the steady paying job at the sacrifice of both his dreams and relationship. It's amazing what we will tell ourselves to convince ourselves that we are happy. Safety is comfort and comfort leads to happiness. But we only get one life on this earth. Why would we spend it doing something we don't like for the chance that everything else will work out?In Mia's case, all she wants was for Sebastian to be supportive of her dream as much as she was for him. Sure it stung a lot for her to have a low turn out at her play, but it hurt way more for Sebastian not to show up. Once they split and he receives the call from the casting agent, we see a complete switch in his mentality and the story unfolds beautifully from there. Mia gets the part, goes to Paris, and then 5 years later we are presented with the sad reality that she had moved on, had a child, and was living her best life. And then, her and her husband take an unexpected turn to avoid traffic and stumble upon a surprise venue.Half way through the movie, I was actually inspired to learn Mia and Sebastian's theme on piano and I can't help but cry while playing it because of the meaning behind the song. It was their song. The song she heard when she first met him, and the song she hears 5 years later when walking into a random Jazz bar one night, only to find that it was Sebastian's. Not only that, but the name of the place was ""Seb's"", the name that she suggested. We then get a scene of what would have happened if things had all gone right, and we see a life where Mia and Sebastian are together and happy, but are quickly reminded of reality, which teaches a very important lesson. We can only move forward. 2 people once in love forced to go their separate ways to follow their dreams are once again together, sharing a magical moment with the song that started it all. 6 years ago I didn't understand, but now I do. They both found happiness and neither of them would have done it without the other. We never know why we are in certain peoples' lives, but the power we hold to make a difference is immense.Now, it is my turn to discover what my dream is. I am currently trapped in the world of security and stability and the fear of doing something I am not comfortable with. This movie has changed my life and I hope to look back in 10, 20, 30, 40 years to credit this film for being the catalyst for me to start living my life the way I want.",La La Land,3783958
1,tuggerwaugh,My favourite movie,10/10,7 February 2020,"The best movies ever made may be Schindler's List or The Shawshank Redemption or Pulp Fiction or Goodfellas or even Groundhog Day. But one movie stands out for me: La La Land.It's perfectly shot, the acting is underplayed in a time when most cinematic blockbusters overact like they are on stage with Jerry Springer. The music is exceptional and the colour is something out of a fairytale.I understand why people don't like musicals. That's your call. Don't rate it then. I don't rate superhero movies because I know the good guys will defeat the bad guys in a predictable monstrosity to chase revenue. This movie doesn't have fight scenes or a shootout or car chase - it's about one basic premise we all face in life - do you follow your dream or your heart?It's a combination of everything that's great about the movies and it shows restraint at the end when it could have easily chosen a different path for our couple.It's funny in parts, excruciatingly sad in others. It finds the perfect balance. It's a masterpiece.",La La Land,3783958
2,TheLittleSongbird,"Like a dream come true, one of those films that totally banishes the blues away",10/10,12 January 2017,"Having just gotten back from seeing 'La La Land', with a rare day off music college, it came to me that it was one of the best new release/first viewings for me in a while.Very few films in recent memory has left me leave the cinema with my heart properly warmed, a beaming smile on my face, tears in my eyes, feeling uplifted and properly moved. 'La La Land' however has managed that feat. Would also go further to say that it is one of the best modern film musicals after Disney's Renaissance period in the 90s, and very much a modern classic. Am not surprised at all its award wins and nominations (including being a record breaker at the Golden Globes), and if it does well at the Oscars as well there will be no complaints from me.'La La Land' clicked with me most likely because of my love for golden age Hollywood, musicals (a somewhat maligned genre these days, but while there are a fair share of not particularly good ones there are a bigger number of great ones and even masterpieces), and how it fondly reminded me of what makes me love them so much. Also because of being able to relate to its themes and conflicts, due to being there myself. The talent was also appetising, starring Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, directed by 'Whiplash's' Damien Chazelle and featuring cameo support from JK Simmons (who coincidentally won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for 'Whiplash), John Legend and Rosemarie DeWitt.It was just sheer joy to see a film with so much potential deliver on that potential and even more so, having seen a lot of stuff recently film and TV that wasted their potential it was refreshing to see a film actually delivering on it.Visually, 'La La Land' is a gorgeous-looking film, with lots of vibrant colour that leap out at you from the screen while not having too much of a dizzying effect and cinematography that's not just a dream to behold but inventively done without falling into self-indulgent territory. The music and songs may induce, and has induced, mixed reactions, count me in as somebody who found the songs infectious, emotion-filled and with enough to make one top-tap and hum along.The musical numbers are winningly choreographed too with non-stop exuberance. The opening number is especially true to this. The script is warm, funny, affectionate and poignant, and also with an honesty. It's not a complex script, nor did it need to be, and neither does it make the mistake of being too simple. The story is admittedly slight in places, then again so were the stories of even the best golden age musicals and they still managed to be classics because of how everything else was executed and because of the atmosphere.Something that is true with 'La La Land', a film where anybody can relate to its themes. Even more special though is that not only does it pay tribute to musicals and films of the golden age (especially those with MGM), with their bold colour, exuberant marriage of music and dance, it also has a winsomeness and melancholic nature seen in films like 'The Umbrellas of Cherbourg' yet does it in a way that will appeal hugely to modern audiences. Loved that the two leads' relationship and chemistry was much more complex than the love-at-first-sight sort (far from it, more antagonists turned lovers) with a meet cute first encounter (again also not a case).Chazelle's direction shows someone with a sheer love for film and film-making, more than evident in execution that is affectionate and full-of-life rather than self-indulgent. The chemistry between the two leads and their performances would need to be good to make the film work. No worries there. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone look so natural and at ease together, nothing looks false and it is easy to root for them and their conflicts.Both of them give terrific performances, performances so good that less than great singing was immediately forgotten about. Especially Stone who has never been better in a performance of great expressivity and nuance, so many emotions such as vulnerability, strength, cheekiness, charm and buoyancy with never a hint of a heavy-handed touch. Gosling matches her, if not quite as good, showing a very charismatic presence and an effortless twinkling charm. All the support, although basically cameos, registers memorably.All in all, a dream come true and totally banishes any blues and daily troubles away. 10/10 Bethany Cox",La La Land,3783958
3,yuenyeeac,Dream or Love,8/10,16 April 2020,"I love you, you can not spend time with me, but it is taboo to look down on my dreams. You don't look at yourself, indulge in fame, forget the original intention, you have no reason to lose temper with me.
I love you when you talk about your dreams, and I do n't love you. I am busy, and I have my dream to work hard.
I love you, so let me go.
Sebastian let her go after her dream because he loved Mia. Because only he knew where her brightest eyes, the most gorgeous smile, and the most energetic look of the whole person came from.
Because I love you, I am not qualified to imprison you by my side. I can never tolerate you doing anything wronged for me.
""About us, just wait for the answer."" Sebastian said as he sat on the bench on the top of the mountain, Mia nodded in conscience.
Even the farewell is full of tacit understanding, and at a glance everything is understood. There is no bitterness and hatred, no complaint.
These are two independent personalities who hold the right to choose. In the bright future, there will be no more lovers like you who appreciate me, but I have a complete dream and myself.
After maturity, Mia became a big star, with a mansion, children, gentleman husband. Sebastian opened a jazz club, the venue was full, the name she gave was the same. Love is the most regrettable, the most indecent, the most shining, the most incomprehensible, the sweetest, and the most grievous, making life in your hands trivial.
Reluctant to say something later, miss is to miss.
We have a calmer and more mature life at the cost of losing each other. But if we did not choose to say goodbye, we will not arrive safely on this shore now.
Dreams seem to be the killer of love, but without dreams, she will not be attracted by the piano sound until the downfall of genius falls into her arms.
It is a dream to make the two lives full of life and make all the lost things meaningful.",La La Land,3783958
4,IreneWatsonC,Loving you is like loving part of my life,8/10,4 April 2020,"This movie is infinitely close to when we were young: arrogant, romantic, dreamy, longing for love, but lack of money. Then when we have tasted the hardships and pains of society and finally achieved something, is the person around you still the one you love the most? Only when you have thoroughly pained and loved, can you understand how difficult it is to be innocent love. Only when you let go can you support your dream and fulfill your pursuit. In the end, Mia's fantasy surprised all the audience. This is the fantasy of all sweet love, and it is the most exciting meaning of this movie. I dare say that if there is no final fantasy, or the hero and heroine are together again, this movie will eventually become a second-rate love song and dance drama. Only if you can't get it, can you fully understand the bitterness and sweetness of youth. After all, the most beautiful love is just a flash in the pan. I love you, but I can only wish you happiness. This is the supreme love. This love becomes a part of life and a belief. LA LA LAND, loving you is like loving part of my life.

5,A_Different_Drummer,Love letter to Hollywood .. and a Heck of a Film,10/10,1 January 2017,"Writer/Director Damien Chazelle, who already had a nice career going for him, explodes into the Bigtime with this delightful, mesmerizing, and completely unexpected ode to Tinseltown.The opening sequence (satirized on the Golden Globes) really does not do the rest of the film justice. It is as if the cast from the FAME remake grew up, had children of their own, and then those children hijacked the Santa Monica freeway to do a 10 minute flash-mob dance sequence.From that point on, the film is hypnotic.We segue to a love story as pure as anything since the great dramas of the 1940s. If the film had been in B&W, you would almost have expected to see Bette Davis in a 3-hankie tear jerker.Except for the musical interludes, of course, which are pitch perfect and totally wonderful.Gosling is surprising as a leading man expected to do song and dance, but he delivers the goods.Stone, who was supposed to be ""the next big thing"" after Easy A (2010), steals the film and possibly the hearts of the audience as well. The awards should flow like water, and she will deserve every one.As I said, deep in the DNA this is an ode to Hollywood. The film industry has always had issues with endings -- back in the day they would film several different endings per picture -- and then decide at the last minute which to use. Here Chazelle pays homage to that by giving us an alternate ending, along with the ""real"" ending, along with a closing sequence designed to remind everyone that nothing in Hollywood is actually real, but everything still can be really fun.Destined to be a classic. Recommended.((Designated ""IMDb Top Reviewer.""

6,elijahz,Shocked me how good it was,9/10,27 November 2019,"I remember when I saw the trailers for this movie, I thought it would be a sad but sweet love story and nothing more. And while it is that it brings so much more flare and beauty that I would never have expected from this. It took me three years to see it and it far out shone any expectation I had.

7,proud_luddite,The best movie of 2016,9/10,20 March 2018,"The main characters in this Los Angeles romantic musical are Mia (Emma Stone), a coffee-shop employee with dreams of being an actress; and Sebastian (Ryan Gosling), a jazz pianist who aspires to open his own club that plays jazz like it was played in the good old days.At long last: a movie released during the 2016 awards season that actually lives up to the hype!Early in the film, there are two superb group musical numbers. The numbers that follow are more low-key relating only to the main characters but they are still well performed and executed.The stories of career struggle within the broader narrative are very believable. They include the hell of auditioning to people who are too busy plus the desire to maintain the purity of a great music genre (jazz) while too often being told it is ""a dying art"".Gosling takes a while to break into the role particularly where the singing is concerned but it's not long before he fits into the part quite nicely. Stone is superb throughout the film. She is even spot-on as an actress giving mediocre auditions. She's given a full range - and not just as a triple threat - and she fully lives up to the expectations especially during the song ""Audition"" near the end.There is something uniquely enjoyable about Hollywood portraying itself. The movie also gives nods to great classic musicals like ""Singin' in the Rain"", ""Les Demoiselles de Rochefort"", and ""Les Parapluies de Cherbourg"" all the while being unique and standing out on its own. In addition, the set designs and photography add further to the film's greatness.The reference to ""Les Parapluies de Cherbourg"" comes through strongly in the movie's final number. This scene is probably the best scene of any movie in 2016. It leaves one with so many mixed emotions and extreme on either side. The production number is magnificent while its mood is melancholy.The teaming of director/writer Damien Chazelle with musical composer Justin Hurwitz is one of the best matches since Jacques Demy and Michel Legrand in the 1960s. - dbamateurcriticOUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENTS:1) Directing by Damien Chazelle2) Acting by Emma Stone3) Music by Justin Hurwitz",La La Land,3783958
8,marcosaguado,For The Love Of Movies,9/10,27 January 2017,"Damien Chazelle is a young director who loves and knows movies, from Federico Fellini to Jacques Demy. Hallellujah! Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone go back to inspire us forward. What's more surprising than anything else is the feel of amateurishness in the dancing in the singing. So refreshing not to have a sleek but empty experience. Damian Chazelle' Whiplash was a brilliant preview of forthcoming attractions. I would love to see a thriller directed by Chazelle, something like Shadow Of A Doubt or even a glossy damsel in distress story like Midnight Lace. That's what happens when we discover a new and startling talent. You want to see him do everything. I have a feeling this young artist will.

9,bob-the-movie-man,"""It's very nostalgic – will people like it?""",10/10,16 January 2017,"A little film. Not sure whether you might have heard of it yet? Damien Chazelle has followed up his astonishingly proficient ""Whiplash"" – my top film of 2015 – with a sure-fire theatre-filler in ""La La Land"". The old- fashioned musical extravaganza is back, and back with style!""La La Land"" tells the bittersweet love story of Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) and Mia (Emma Stone) who first meet in an LA traffic jam but then get thrown together by chance (LA is such a small place after all!). Over the course of the next four seasons romance blossoms. Mia is a struggling actress bouncing from audition to audition in a hopeless attempt to break through in LA's tough movie business. She makes ends meet as a Barista on the Warner Brother's lot. Meanwhile Sebastian is on a mission of his own: a talented musician, he is trying to restore jazz to the main stage (something the film's soundtrack will undoubtedly help do!) by opening his own classic jazz bar. As both strive for success on their own terms can love survive to deliver us the classic 'Hollywood ending'? The film is technically astonishing, with clever continuous shots of the ""Birdman"" variety and masterly cinematography (by Linus Sandgren of ""Joy"" and ""American Hustle""). The lighting team in particular is superb: a case in point is Mia's 'in-Seine' (sic) song, with breathtaking fades of the background to darkness, a camera whizz-around the actress for effect and then a brilliant fade back to reality. Loved it. Overall, there are enough similar moments in the film to make cinema-lovers like me gasp with delight.There's a curious timelessness about the piece which is surely deliberate. Whilst there are obvious and non-apologetic throwbacks to the classic musicals of the 50's like ""West Side Story"" and ""Singin' in the Rain"" and references to ""Casablanca"" and ""Rebel without a Cause"", there is also a 60's vibe to the 'girls getting ready' sequence; an 80's A-ha cover thrown in at a pool party; and a Californian Prius obsession that is surely more 'noughties' than current. Most curiously, while everyone has smartphones no one seems to text anyone to announce changes to plans: the film is almost distancing itself from much of modern life.In the acting stakes Emma Stone again shines like a beacon. She is just magnetic on the screen: (tiny spoiler) the biggest plot hole in the film is why on earth she wasn't given the part for her first audition! I was disappointed she didn't win the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for ""Birdman"" in the ""87th Awards"" (she lost out to Patricia Arquette for ""Boyhood""): but she just keeps getting better and Better and BETTER. Ryan Gosling's confident and cocky turn also radiates charisma: in particular, it is astonishing that Gosling could play ""only a few chords"" on the piano before training for the film. A confidence boost for struggling piano learners everywhere. It is actually difficult to imagine two better actors for the roles. (Emma Watson allegedly turned it down for ""Beauty and the Beast"": something she might be kicking herself for!) Are they both the best singers and dancers when compared to Gene Kelly, Fred Astaire, Debbie Reynolds (R.I.P.) or Cyd Charisse? No, undoubtedly not, but they have an undeniable charm all of their own. (Perhaps we will see the ilk of the great hoofers and crooners rise again with a resurgence in the classic musical. Can Hollywood take a hint?) The big question: now that both Stone and Gosling have won Golden Globes for acting in the ""Comedy or Musical"" category, can they convert that to Oscar glory where there is a single category in play? I'd like to think so. It's also great to see proper movie-making taking place in the Hollywood studios again: during my recent visits to LA there seemed to be little other than TV work going on in the main studio complexes there (although its worth pointing out that for this film not all of the filming was actually done on the Warner Brothers lot). Musicals are clearly measured by the quality of the music, and Justin Hurwitz (""Whiplash"") has produced a gem with – notwithstanding the jazz numbers and a catchy little pop number from John Legend – merely a handful of simple but unforgettable melodies that recur in different variations throughout the film. The soundtrack is already in my Amazon library and uplifting my mood on what is a damp and dreary Monday here in the UK.Damien Chazelle has delivered a triumph in both direction and original script. There is really very little I can fault the film on. In what was the somewhat patchy Coen brothers offering from last year – ""Hail Caesar"" – there was a standout moment of a throwback song and dance number with Channing Tatum that I raved about (you can find it on youtube). If I was being picky, then this tantalizing snippet would be a better representation of the style and vim of the original genre – – with the exception of the opening number, few of the song and dance numbers in ""La La Land"" quite get to that ""Broadway Melody"" level of scale and energy. This, together with a few concerns about the pacing in some places, led me to rate this as a 4.5 on first viewing.However on now seeing it twice within 36 hours, it's got me well and truly under its spell! I normally emotionally resist films that arrive with excessive hype but, in this case I give in. 10/10.(For the graphical version of this review, visit bob-the-movie-man.com).",La La Land,3783958
10,Theo Robertson,Very Well Made But Not My Kind Of Movie,7/10,17 January 2017,"Did someone say last year's Oscars were too white ? So let's award most of this year's Oscars to something that looks like an explosion in a paint factory where every primary colour is splashed across the screen . LA LA LAND was being touted as the film to beat even before most of the other contenders were announced and its domination at the Golden Globes confirmed everything . Looks like the 2017 Oscars will be the most predictable event of this year Romantic musicals aren't my thing so my dread was realised in the opening scene with a California highway turning in to a song and dance scene so camp I thought I was watching a forest of pink tents which hints at what you're going to get - feelgood factor whether you want it or not . It was at this point I seriously considered giving up on the movie and going on youtube to listen to proper love songs by the likes of The The and Joy Division As the film continued the narrative did expose itself to being what you expect , two young people , a man and a woman , who are embarking on fulfilling their careers in respectively jazz music and acting . There's not a lot here we haven't seen before but what sells this movie is the visual work director Damien Chazelle has put in to it . The language of cinema is very much to the fore especially the stunning cinematography and my abiding memory is the scene where the two protagonists meet and an impact aesthetic is instantly created by the way the lighting changes . Many scenes are similarity beautiful but if there's a fundamental problem remains that no matter how well made a film is if you've no interest in the genre then you won't become a convert . As it stands LA LA LAND will dominate the Oscars like the French film THE ARTIST did five years ago then become quickly forgotten",La La Land,3783958
11,gsygsy,Believe the hype,9/10,9 October 2016,"What a great movie! Who would have thought anyone could bring the original screen musical back from the dead? Yet here it is, hale and hearty.The music is melodic but never simplistic; the lyrics are intelligent and intelligible; the script is funny, touching without ever resorting to sentimentality; the two leads are not only skillful but full of a kind of charm that I honestly thought had disappeared entirely from American movies: but here we have Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone just oozing it.The only pebbles in this ocean of inventiveness are some routine dance routines and over-reliance on the device of lights dimming on set to isolate an actor in white light, but that's me being r-e-a-l-l-y picky. It may well be that this is the best musical written directly for the screen since SEVEN BRIDES FOR SEVEN BROTHERS.All credit to writer-director Damien Chazelle and his team - and it really feels like a team-movie - for giving us this gem. Sure it's a feelgood piece, but it creates a world which is complex, it acknowledges alternative outcomes for its characters, it connects with people's passions, and in the case of Ms Stone's big solo, ""Audition"", it has a bona fide classic.",La La Land,3783958

13,wgerhardt,A true ode to the Golden Era of Hollywood,10/10,10 August 2019,"The vibrant colors and use of musical scores to set the mood for scenes transported myself back in time. This movie feels not only like a beautifully nostalgic nod to Hollywood of yesteryear, but also that of a timeless love story. Gosling and Stone have a charm to their chemistry on screen during the musical and dance numbers. All these aspects lead to a raw portrayal of love that many experience in life, with still providing a sense of hope and wonder to the viewers. I was entranced from the opening scene until the final note played by Goslings piano. I absolutely recommend this film to any and everyone!

14,RussHog,Blah Blah Bland,3/10,3 January 2017,"What is everyone in this film singing and dancing about? Our story starts off in a traffic jam on a freeway and suddenly everyone does a song and dance number that sets the tone that this film is a colorful original musical about ambitious young people who pursue their dreams in LA. The opening musical number is painful to watch but I assume the story will improve.Our central characters are an actress who aspires to be a famous movie star and a musician who aspires to be a moody jazz pianist. She falls in love with him when she first hears him play his music. He falls in love with her as they begin to date and explore Hollywood. They soon trip head over heals in love and as if by magic they dance with bliss along the milky way. The only problem is - she soon reveals that she does not understand what is so great about jazz. (Wait - I thought she loved his music when she first heard him play?) So he explains the history of jazz and the poetry of the musician. That seems good enough and they continue their starry eyed romance. But her auditions are a bust. No work. Nothing changes. She has to write a one woman play to perform to demonstrate her craft. Yet he lands an opportunity to perform in a big band - the only problem is the music will be more upbeat pop funk jazz hybrid that will make him pretty good money but also take him away from his dreams to be the moody jazz pianist. He sells out to get work - and she stays true to herself and finds no work. This creates a schism and they have a very corny argument about creative direction. He does not understand what is wrong with him making money and traveling and being famous even if he truly knows that it sells out his dreams. She does not understand why she cannot get work even though she stays true to her dreams - and when her one woman show is a dud she decides to quit her dreams and move back home. Our dashing hero feels awful and soon learns that she has one final audition that awaits and so he drives to her home in Nevada to tell her that she must return for one final audition. They travel back to LA - she sings at her audition - and she gets the role. Both have their own careers now - so they split up. Five years later - she is a famous movie star married with children and he has his own jazz club where he lives his dreams as a moody jazz pianist. One night by happenstance - she stumbles into the club and finds him. He plays a solo piano song and she has a dream where their entire love affair is relived only all the choices which led to their separation are made differently and they stay together and have a family and discover their dreams as a couple. Suddenly, she understands what his words meant so long ago - about the history of jazz - the poetry of the musician - now everything comes full circle - and they have a longing final glance. This is all cool - don't get me wrong. But the story itself has been told so many times its clichés are even clichéd. The songs and dialogue are very uneven and at times the film is incoherently stupid. Really - do young couples talk about why they would sell out their dreams to make thousands of dollars a month? Also, the big red flag with the story is that the music simply is not very good. There is not one memorable song or dance in the entire film! Mostly the lights and costumes replace any real choreography or musical number with a unique visual cue. Also, Ryan Gosling is poorly cast as a jazz pianist. It just does not feel real at all that Gosling is so, so sad in LA with his poor dreams of being a jazz pianist so hard to recognize as he dates lovely women.What exactly is the purpose of this film? What was everyone singing and dancing about? Do we live in a world where people can fly down to LA and pursue their dreams with a shot like yesteryear? Or do we live in a world where educational alliances, corporate oligarchy, family connections, and the occasional marriage - determine who gets to shine in the lights? Are we as a people supposed to rejoice that the song and dance of old Hollywood musicals had a tribute film made just in time for the Oscar season? I dunno - this movie does have some strong moments in the script - and it does have some good acting - costumes - and lights - but I just think it's corny and I could not care less.",La La Land,3783958
15,jtindahouse,Pretentious nonsense,4/10,7 January 2017,"I'll call it right now. 'La La Land' will win Best Picture at the Academy Awards, and for no other reason than the fact that the Academy loves a film about the industry. If there's a film based around movies in anyway amongst the nominees list, put your money on it to win. Does it deserve the award? No, there were many superior films released in 2016.Hollywood seems to be obsessed with Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone as a couple. This is their third film appearance together and for my liking they just get worse every time. Comparing the chemistry for example to Gosling and Rachel McAdams in 'The Notebook', they are worlds apart. Stone is a very good actress as far as emotional range goes, but she can't pull off the likable tag very well.I really enjoyed Damien Chazelle's previous film 'Whiplash'. In a lot of ways they are very similar films, but in the more important ways they are worlds apart. The biggest difference is the modesty that 'Whiplash' achieved. It had great characters, yet it acted like it didn't know it. 'La La Land' has very average, even poor occasionally, characters yet acts like they're God's gift to cinema.I was really disappointed coming out of 'La La Land'. Even though I knew it wasn't my type of film ideally, I was willing to give it a chance and thought it might surprise me due to my low expectations. On the contrary though, it managed to fall below my expectations. My advice would be don't be fooled by the reviews and probable Oscar nominations. There's nothing to see here.",La La Land,3783958
16,lasttimeisaw,an absolute stunner and expert raconteur,9/10,7 September 2016,"The opening film of Venice '73, a strong contestant of the Golden Lion, Tinseltown's latest prodigy Damien Chazelle's wildly-anticipated follow-up of WHIPLASH (2014), LA LA LAND is an exuberant revamp of the Golden Age's musical formula and miraculously transposed onto a contemporary milieu, an absolute stunner and expert raconteur chronicles the effervescent romance between a jazz pianist Sebastian (Gosling) and a waitress Mia (Stone), who aims to break into the showbiz in the City of Angels, without ever compromising its realistic spin.Fully embracing the widescreen splendor, the film's winning opening gambit is a slithering singing- and-dancing sequence on the chockablock freeway choreographed in one dashing long shot. Then the film pans out its narration of an ever-typical girl-meet-boy story (in this case, it is the girl who makes the first move), divided by seasons with a winter-to-winter rotation, initially, the story bifurcates in two different forks until the two finally hit the ground running, interposed with scintillating music numbers which can hypnotically melt your heart and dazzle your mind. Chazelle adroitly centers on two protagonists through and through like in those vintage romantic flicks where you can see haloes around them, anyone, anything else in their world has all duly faded into the dark background whenever their eyes meet, their hands touch, and they kiss.Gosling and Stone, whose on-screen dynamism has been patently tested in Glenn Ficarra and John Requa's CRAZY, STUPID, LOVE (2011), let sparks fly higher as they plunge wholeheartedly into the torrid journey, from misunderstanding, meet-cute, falling for each other, to supporting each other's dreams, taking the middle ground or simply giving up, doubting and bickering, to the highest level of unconditional and unadulterated love - the holy sacrifice to let go of each other when their time is due, the Gosling-Stone pair is superbly amicable, adorable and charismatic, each is blessed with their own tuneful theme songs CITY OF STARS and AUDITION respectively, and satiates viewers with a show-stopping tap-dancing. Gosling, as dapper as ever, oozes with a heart-throbbing attentiveness and devotion as a talented pianist who is bent on opening his own jazz bar, a traditionalist but deadly romantic; Stone, portrays a character so naturally rooted in her chromosomes, an aspiring actress-to-be finally pays her dues after numberless humiliating auditions, her vivacity, comic timing and line delivery are top-notch, both are eyeing for their second Oscar nomination at this stage.Heading to the upcoming Oscar race, Chazelle, of course, is the one who deserves all the fanfare for his virtuoso directing competence, one will be sublimely intoxicated by his vision of L.A. envelopped with an indelible mauve palette in lieu of its usual sun-dappled glamour, vibrant props and tableaux vivants, not to mention the central music elements, which is always in the veins of Chazelle's works, his cherry-picked jazz-fusion, the fluent and sleek choreography, Justin Hurwitz's overwhelmingly soothing attendant score apart from several striking ear-worms, all those above-mentioned herald that a major cinematic director, with a distinct and greatly entertaining aesthetics adorned by his music flair, is in the offing in the land of L.A..Last but definitely not the least, how can one not praise for the silent epilogue in the end, Chazelle soberly let audience get a view of what would happen to the perfect-matched couple if they were living in an ideal Hollywood fairy-tale, but reality, in most times, is a far cry from fairy-tale, we have to move on without our perfect-half, but that is not to say, life will be miserable or intolerable, thanks to Chazelle's perspicuous vision, in a long run, we might be able to cherish the true happiness once we were fortunately bequeathed, and perhaps, it never leaves us, it always stay with us, to savor, to reminisce and to never give up our dreams.",La La Land,3783958
17,dromasca,"sorry, not a masterpiece",7/10,10 January 2017,"The buzz is high, the prizes started to accumulate. They tell however more about the status of the industry and the longing of the public for escapist entertainment combined with a high dose of nostalgia for the musical successes that were running high 60 or 70 years ago. La La Land directed by Damien Chazelle combines a well known formula, makes reverences to the golden period of the musical films in Hollywood (some scenes were filmed in the studio were Fred Astaire once was filmed) but also to some more modern film makers and their ideas (like Ki-duk Kim), and enjoys the participation of shining stars like Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone. It may be sufficient for collecting statuettes. It is not enough to make it a real good film. I know I am in a minority expressing this opinion now. I believe that it will be a growing minority soon.What we get with La La Land a collection of a few wonderful moments connected by an awfully schematic story. Boy meets girl, of course. Boy is an aspiring jazz musician in a time when real jazz seems to be in a descending slope of interest, Girl is an aspiring actress, waiting in a Starbucks (or like) coffee shop and auditioning in a serial and desperate manner. They both have visions and passion. They both aspire to careers, but life is tough and art and success seldom meet for one person and almost never with personal happiness. Or true love. From here on the story accumulates many of the possible stereotypes and too little artistic truth. Great scenes are not missing - actually this film has a number of memorable quotes, the problem is the rosy sweet materials on between. There is also one great idea that I liked - who does it belong to? script writers or director - the non-reality scenes are drawn in music and dance. The ones from the films in the 40s and 50s.When jazz is played however, it's different. Jazz music is also about being true, great jazzmen do not lie when they play music. Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) explaining to Mia (Emma Stone) what jazz is about is one of the best scenes I have ever seen about jazz. The problem is that this is not a jazz movie. As much as I love Ryan Gosling and appreciate Emma Stone their chemistry on screen is not enough to sustain the film, and it actually makes their breaking (and the break away scene) even less credible.Just to be clear - La La Land is not a bad movie. Damien Chazelle is at his third film, the two other were also one way or the other related to music. Whiplash was welcome with ravishing critics and a very high IMDb rating. La La Land however belongs to a very different category. In the thin air of the ideas and good cinema of the last years it will get a lot of prizes in the next couple of months. Many of them are not deserved. I write this by respect for what the film is (and is not) and for what the Academy, BAFTA, or Golden Globe awards should be. I am expecting more and better films about music from Damien Chazelle. Maybe a great jazz movie.",La La Land,3783958
18,planktonrules,A nice experiment...though I wasn't exactly captivated by it.,7/10,11 November 2018,"""La La Land"" made quite a splash after it debuted. It's now on IMDB's Top 250 and received 6 Oscars! But, with all that publicity, it might just leave you feeling like me...that's it is a decent film, but hardly a great film.The story is of two struggling artists...one an actress (Emma Stone) and another a jazz musician (Ryan Gosling). Each appears ready to give up their beloved craft after years of disappointments and bills....and that is when they both meet and fall in love. Ultimately, however, their careers DO take off and this leads you to wonder if they can make it TOGETHER. After all, being a famous actress or musician isn't exactly part-time work!In many ways, this film reminds me of the ending in ""The Umbrellas of Cherbourg"". This sort of downbeat ending didn't really bother me...it was realistic. But somehow ""La La Land"" muddled it all up...and left you with a confusing ending that PROBABLY was like ""Umbrellas""...but maybe wasn't. I found this to be a huge problem. Aside from this, I also was not a huge fan of the characters...though I must admit it DID leave me misty-eyed more than a few times. Well worth seeing...but a film that isn't perfect...and you'd expect a six Oscar film to be absolutely perfect.",La La Land,3783958
19,SimonJack,"This ""hardly musical"" can't compare with the great song and dance films of the past",5/10,7 May 2021,"After watching this movie in early 2021 on DVD, I was puzzled by its very high IMDb rating. With more than half a million ratings, ""La La Land"" had an average of 8.0. I am a long-time fan of musicals of all varieties, so the high rating of this film seems strange. How could so many people think this film is equal to the best musicals of all time? Do they really think it is better than all but a few musicals? Musicals with a dozen or more songs? With hit tunes? With great compositions by famous composers? With singing by the best and most popular singers? With dance numbers and choreography by the greatest hoofers of all time?""La La Land"" has a total of six songs. The great musicals have 10 to 18 songs. Can anyone name a single hit tune from this movie? Can anyone even remember one of the songs? Did either of the leads record any of the songs -- Ryan Gosling or Emma Stone? Are either of them known for their singing or recording? Does either one have a hit record? Are there any known dancers in this film?I have seen way more than 200 musicals, and most of them were better than ""La La Land."" So, when I watched this film, it struck me that most of the people who rated it just hadn't seen many musicals. Surely none of the great ones of the past. And that would mean that they have little to compare with what little music, singing and dancing there is in this movie. So, perhaps it's a sign of the times. Perhaps there aren't such gifted musicians and singers and dancers that past decades had. Or, it might be an indication of how starved modern audiences are for quality entertainment.But there are a couple other possibilities for why this movie is rated so high. The first is the sentimental romance story. Modern people may be starved for good entertainment in the area of romance and love with the technology overload of the 21st century. And, then there is the ""sale"" of Los Angeles itself - including Hollywood and related sights. The publicity says from the start that this movie is a celebration of L. A. And, it shows a glamorized city, all clean and neat and without blemish. One wonders how many of the ratings for this movie came from the movie capital itself - from the 13 million people of the Los Angeles area, or the 24 million of southern California.It's not hard to imagine that a real propaganda film for the movie capital of the world, got high marks from its own area. And, that some others who thought it a smashing musical are among a population that doesn't know the great musicals of the past and/or that is starved for really great musical talent and entertainment. Adding all of that together is probably the basis for the high rating of this movie. I would wager that after separating out all the ratings of this movie that came from Southern California, the resulting average from the rest of the country - however large or small the number, would not be higher than 7.0, and would probably be closer to 6.5 or lower. There probably are a lot of 10 ratings from the Los Angeles environs, and many 7, 6 and lower ratings from the rest of the country.I'm not trashing the acting of Ryan Gosling, Emma Stone or any of the rest of the cast of this film. They were good to very good. But none of them are accomplished singers or dancers. While a couple of the choreographed larger dance scenes are good, they are more acrobatic with modern dance, than anything like the footwork of the great talents in films of the past. This film has nothing to compare to Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly, Gene Nelson, Ginger Rogers, Eleanor Powell or dozens more actors who also could sing and dance.With so many reviews already, I'm just weighing in to apprise younger audiences who enjoy musicals of all kinds, about some of the truly great musicals of the past. Here's a short list of films everyone should enjoy. For starters, there are three wonderful films from the 1930s - ""Top Hat"" of 1935, ""Show Boat"" of 1936, and ""The Wizard of Oz"" of 1939. The last one was in color. Color would take over after ""Broadway Melody of 1940"" and following the war years. The 1940s included top hits such as ""Blue Skies"" of 1946 with a dozen Irving Berlin tunes and Fred Astaire's debut of ""Puttin' on the Ritz,"" and ""Easter Parade"" of 1948 with Judy Garland and Astaire. The 1950s were dynamite years for great musicals - ""On Moonlight Bay"" of 1951, ""Singin' in the Rain"" of 1952 with Gene Kelly and Debbie Reynolds, ""The Glenn Miller Story"" of 1954, ""White Christmas"" of 1954 with Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye, and three of the greatest Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals - ""Oklahoma"" of 1955, ""The King and I"" of 1956, and ""South Pacific"" of 1958. The 1960s had such great musicals as ""Westside Story"" of 1961, ""My Fair Lady"" and ""Mary Poppins"" of 1964, ""The Sound of Music"" of 1965, and ""Hello Dolly"" of 1969.And, although the interest in musicals had waned by the 1960s, every decade has had several musical films made - some of them great films. The musical still has a considerable fan base, especially those with great music, dancing, choreography and plots. So, among later smashing musicals are ""Fiddler on the Roof"" 1971, ""Amadeus"" of 1984, ""Newsies"" of 1992, ""Immortal Beloved"" of 1994, ""Chicago"" of 2002, ""Phantom of the Operate"" of 2004, and ""Les Misérables"" of 2012.",La La Land,3783958
20,Hitchcoc,A Really Pleasant Experience,9/10,7 January 2017,"It's so nice that someone was willing to produce an original musical that wasn't animated. Emma Stone and Ryan Goslin light up the screen. The songs are very well written and fit well within the parameters of the romance that develops. I think the people that are so angry about the hype this film has gotten forget that the musicals it mimics had pretty basic plots. Oh, so it's the worst film of the year! Really? This is a story about dreams and hopes and trying to achieve them in an environment where the chances are really slim. The production numbers are sappy to be sure, but that's what this kind of offering puts to us. It tells us that we can just have fun and root for the characters.

21,Cinema_Love,"The term overrated has been created for a reason, THIS FILM !",2/10,11 January 2017,"This film starts with a great promise. We follow a musician and an aspiring actress who meet and fall in love in Los Angeles. The film's title is a reference both to a nickname for the city of Los Angeles and to the idiom for being out of touch with reality. But where it fails it all the rest. The movie is well acted no doubt, but the subject, you care less and less. And even if you want to, this film is a 90 minutes romantic comedy that turns out to be 130... even Woody Allen will think it's too much, i want the shorter version. I was bored to death and i'm a huge fan of Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone Work... here I try, but can't ! It's just too long !

22,moonspinner55,"Weightless--as it's meant to be--and not without heart, but this balloon wafts away instead of soars...",4/10,14 January 2017,"One can say many things about writer-director Damien Chazelle's ""La La Land"" and, indeed, the critics' plaudits and accolades have already infiltrated our national consciousness: it's a valentine to movie musicals; it's a musical for people who don't like musicals; it's a feel-good movie for all audiences; it's a tonic for our national malaise. The story--separated into seasonal chapters--is pretty basic: Emma Stone is a barista on the Warner Bros. movie lot who aspires to be an actress but can't get passed the audition phase; Ryan Gosling is a jazz pianist who longs to play his own compositions. They encourage each other to follow their dreams, which doesn't necessarily mean taking the financially lucrative road (although having money in the bank would certainly be an incentive for a better future, even if the 'artistic value' isn't there yet). Yes, Chazelle is in love with movies--he steals enough from the motion picture past to tell us that--and, certainly, the opening musical number on a jammed Los Angeles freeway is full of contagious acrobatic joy and celebration. The trouble is, these two young people aren't willing to compromise (perhaps that would be allowing for too much realism). Chazelle attempts to show us that success doesn't always lead to happiness, yet his protagonists don't see the big picture; starry-eyed, they want instant gratification through artistic expression. The dancing is polished (too polished, I thought) and the early numbers (such as one with Stone and her girlfriends) have a sprightly quality that is old-fashioned in concept and charmingly lacking in pretension. Still, the hardships of a romantic relationship pulled in different directions isn't all that interesting here, mainly because Gosling and Stone seem so charmed and picture-perfect. She trembles with a beginner's desperation during her auditions and is convincingly unhappy when her one-woman show doesn't pan out, but watching her out to dinner with an affluent date and his friends reveals nothing more than a princess eager to try another throne. Gosling has a moment or two when he's able to give us a natural response to a line or situation, but his concern for Stone seldom registers. The brightly-painted film is reaching for a certain height--a plastic paradise, a movie heaven--that will flood us with good feelings in its attempt and break our hearts with its climax. However, if you are not invested in these characters by the midway point, it will all seem like a glossy charade. ** from ****",La La Land,3783958
23,bartonj2410,You'll be toe-tapping from start to finish,10/10,8 October 2016,"You know when you're watching a film that you just don't want to end, and when it does end you feel as if you could watch it all over again right there and then? I had that feeling with La La Land, the new film from Damien Chazelle, who blew us all away with Whiplash a few years ago.With La La Land, Chazelle has made an irresistible musical comedy-drama that serves up a real delight for the eyes and ears. If you haven't heard of this film yet (where have you been?), I'm sure you will do in the coming months.Mia Dolan (Emma Stone) is an aspiring actress serving coffees to film stars while Sebastian Wilder (Ryan Gosling) is a jazz pianist playing a small time bar to make ends meet. The two meet and fall in love but it's their dreams of success that soon threaten to tear them apart.The most striking thing about La La Land is just how beautifully crafted a film it is; the story, performances, music, dance numbers and cinematography all playing their part in making this such an unforgettable cinematic experience. I genuinely can't find one single fault in this film.Chazelle proves yet again just how mature he is for such a young filmmaker, writing and directing such a touching and often funny love story with a meticulous energy. The whole feel of the film is a throwback to the golden age of musicals, a decision a lot of filmmakers would have been too scared to make yet the pay off is massively satisfying. The gorgeous cinematography from Linus Sandgren brings the city of Los Angeles to life, awash with colour, while his swift camera-work, including some impressive long takes, in particular through the dance numbers, immerses the audience right in the middle of this dreamlike musical.Coming to the performances, La La Land features two superb lead performances from Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, both giving arguably their best performance to date. Gosling has really grown on me as an actor, maturing into one of the best in the business today. He proved earlier this year that he has a knack for comedy in The Nice Guys and he proves it yet again here. Stone always manages to impress me and she is dazzling in La La Land, singing and dancing her way into our hearts. The pair share an undeniable chemistry and I would love to see them both get the recognition they deserve come awards season.Justin Hurwitz's score and the original songs in La La Land, along with the wonderfully choreographed dance sequences, including a great opening number that sets the tone for the rest of the film, heighten the film's level of originality, maintaining that energy Chapelle's films possess.I dare you to try and not fall in love with La La Land. I fell in love with it and I'm sure many more will do so too.",La La Land,3783958

25,stevepat99,If only I had not just watched Singin' in the Rain,2/10,1 January 2017,"Thought this would be a dandy New Years film. Just days before, when Debbie Reynolds passed away I spent time watching the classic dance/song numbers in Singin' in the Rain. Yes, the film's opening number was a fine homage to musicals of the golden age. Then, I could not help but compare Ryan and Emma's lack luster amateur dance efforts to the amazing talents of such as Debbie, Donald and Gene Kelly. Blah versus excellence. Next, I had to endure Ryan trying to sing, total failure. Emma a notch better but again not ready for prime time. No one left the theater humming anything close to an unforgettable tune. Time for me to again start humming Singin' in the Rain.The 'story' moved at snails pace for the most part. A major plot whole when a character makes a major, life altering decision which is totally ignored as if it never happened. Perhaps there is a missing scene on the cutting room floor since this then permitted an alternate ending which, of course, made no sense.Finally, many others are right to note the lack of chemistry between Ryan and Emma.To vote anything close to an 8.9 you need memorable songs, great chemistry, ever greater singing and dance talents plus a story that makes sense rather then contradicting itself. Sadly, I found all these qualities totally lacking.",La La Land,3783958
26,antoniatejedabarros,"La La Land: An Annoying, full of clichés, and Cheesy Torture",1/10,23 January 2017,"I don't usually write negative reviews. But since this movie is stealing all the awards so far, and some people are calling that dull & cheesy film ""a masterpiece"" I felt forced to write something. LLL is a movie made from plastic. It is full of clichés and a it has a fake aroma of nostalgia.The beginning does have neither weight nor meaning. The director only wants to tell us here, in case we don't notice afterwards, that this movie is a musical. Good for him, because who could have guessed that with all the bad singing and the bad dancing!The love story is completely predictable and fake for the first hour or so, until the first fight.Somebody has said that this film is a super-white film about 2 ""baby-dreamers"", and I completely agree. Where is the Art? Where is the real struggle? There are today millions of people dying from hunger, wars, violence, and incurable diseases, and to sink because a play didn't turn out how you expected or you cannot be the jazz pianist number one is really childish. Good things: the cinematography and the flashbacks are very good. The end is the best. That turn is actually original but does not make any sense any way. Let's not forget that the girl and the boy are where they are because she was depressed for her career failure. So, the turn does not actually make any sense. The jazz is good too (I mean, the REAL jazz musicians). And Ryan Gosling (who is OK in the film but not amazing) is actually playing the piano, which, in a Hollywood movie is already a lot. Annoying things: the worst is, in my opinion, Emma Stone. I never understood her ""talent"". She is just a ""pretty"" face with a skinny (anorexic?) body who seems to think she is too good to prepare for her roles. Her singing & dancing are awful. Let's remember that in Irrational Man (I love Woody Allen!) she didn't even bother taking a piano lesson for her role of ""pianist"". Her hairdo is very annoying (she always seems to have just come out from the hairdresser) and I never understood why she cannot appear in even one frame without make up. How this mediocre actress won the Golden Globe for BP by an Actress in a MP - Musical or Comedy in stead of the amazing Meryl Streep or the amazing Annette Bening shows how Hollywood is losing it. And the fact that she won the SAG Award (Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role) in stead of Meryl Streep or Natalie Portman shows how this movie has blinded Hollywood. The most hilarious thing would be that she wins the Oscar (and, sadly, she probably will), being in the same category as Ruth Negga (who made an stunning performance in Loving), Meryl Streep (always amazing and always great), Natalie Portman and Isabelle Huppert (one of the best European actresses of today). But, hey, if Sandra Bullock got and Oscar in 2010, Stone could definitely get one too!Gosling can play the piano but he definitely cannot sing: his voice does not have any power and it sounds like olive oil. His dancing is, as his partner's, mediocre. How come he ended wining the Golden Globe for BP by an Actor in a MP - Musical or Comedy in stead of Hugh Grant (who gave his best performance ever in FFJ) is a real mystery. Luckily, and for the sake of Art, he didn't get the SAG Award (who went to the amazing Denzel). The clichés of LLL are endless: girl meets boy and at first they hate each other but after they like each other. The detail with the famous actress who enters in the Café is also predictable. And how rude (not cool) is to refuse an invitation! There are lots of holes in the movie. Boy and girl keep bumping into each other in a city as huge as LA, and many more, but I am not going to tell them because I don't want to reveal the plot and turns of the movie. 14 Oscar nominations? Give me a break! As somebody said, it's the endless story about Hollywood in love with itself. Pity, I will definitely not watch the Oscars this year. There were lots of really great movies this year and they did not get 14 Oscar nominations: Collateral Beauty, Loving, Hidden Figures, Lion, Moonlight, Elle, Florence Foster Jenkins, Smrt u Sarajevu, Fences... LLL should have got 1 Oscar nomination only (cinematography, Sandgren).The whole movie, even if it features some great black jazz musicians, has a white-ish taste that is unbearable. I don't care AT ALL if the actors are white, black, yellow, orange or green. But this cheesy movie with 2 black actors definitely wouldn't have got 14 Oscars nominations. Why? Because from the 6,000 Academy members, 73% are men, 27% women; 89% are white, and only 11% are people of color. The age average is 60 years old (that can explain the love for this mediocre musical (I would not call it a musical, because in the musicals the actors actually know to sing and know to dance). The world is, sadly, still very racist. That's why many people are calling this film White White Land for a reason. That LLL is stealing all the awards and probably will also steal many Oscars shows the decadency of cinema today in the US. Either that or people are really bored and need an empty and cheesy love story to be entertained. I think that Hollywood should learn from that reality that European cinema knows to depict, away from clichés and empty love stories, away from pretty actors with fake hairdos and plastic bodies. If LLL has achieved something is that: a new line of decadence, clichés, and cheesiness in American cinema.",La La Land,3783958
27,ianzgreat,A wonderful and loving ode to the dreamers and artists of the world.,10/10,17 September 2016,"When I first saw the trailer for La La Land my expectations were set high. The excellent cast, the music and an exciting new director/writer were enough to get me in the door. I'm always a bit hesitant when it comes to filmed musicals.. Will it be stagy, stilted and awkward? Not in this case. Damien Chazelle has made a wonderfully cinematic and loving ode to the dreamers and artists of the world. Having lived in LA and worked on both sides of the camera I can relate to much of this film's endearing observations, trials and tribulations; but anyone who's ever yearned for what seems impossible and searched for true love will also easily connect with this film's gargantuan heart. I'm a self proclaimed total movie snob not easily pleased by much of what I see, but La La Land gave me all the feels and more. I cannot recommend this film enough. It's the kind of film you leave and you don't want the buzz, the tickle, the movie-high to end. I can't wait to see it again when it's in wide release. The artist in me is inspired again.

I still sing the theme song inside, city of stars.I don't know what to say, because the aftertaste of the movie is still in my heart, I can only wait until I have seen the movie countless times, in my real calm down, I can say something.

29,pyrocitor,Dream On,7/10,1 February 2017,"In January 2016, Aziz Ansari originated an SNL skit where he is interrogated at a police station for insufficiently adoring La La Land. ""I meanI liked it! I just didn't think it was ah-mazing!"" he protests. ""What DO you like if you don't like La La Land??!"" is the vitriolic, bellowed response. Well, you'd better get my handcuffs ready. A cynic would point out that every 3-5 years, Hollywood and its audiences remember the musical genre exists, and fall rapturously in love with each new tent-pole release as if its predecessors had never existed (Les Misérables? Chicago? Okay, I'll stop). I'm not cynical enough to dismiss La La Land outright as such, but I am on Ansari's team on this one. Damien Chazelle's follow up to his blistering Whiplash IS lots of fun. It's a boisterous, sweet, massively charming slice of cheese with a sloshing side order of nostalgia. And it buys into its clichéd, pandering familiarity with such outrageous gusto it's almost easy to forget how fundamentally vacuous it is. So there you go. Lock me up, and throw away the key. Like 2011's The Artist, it's a glossy, heartfelt riff on the overwhelming power of the Classics (here, in a Whiplash hangover, jazz greats receive equal adulation to Da Moofies) and how soul-crushing it can be to fall short in comparison. It's Scorsese's New York, New York for the YouTube generation, if you will. And this proves to be the film's greatest asset and pitfall simultaneously: it plays phenomenally in instalments. Chazelle is a whiz at conjuring moments of transcendental movie magic, riffing on the whimsical, expressionistic flourishes of the Singin' in the Rain era, bubblegum colours, triumphant tap dancing, floating through the air framed by a sea of stars and all. Linus Sandgren's spectacular cinematography helps astronomically to pump up proceedings, as the camera zips through parked cars, swimming pools and past whirling dancers like a caffeine-addled hummingbird. And that opening four minute long take crane shot? Has to be seen to be believed. But, for all these highs of spectacle come the crashing lows of the story gluing them together. It's immediately, unshakably apparent that Chazelle's script is too flamboyantly nostalgic to offer much that hadn't already been done to death in the 'good ol' days' it cherishes, and it's a shame to see a movie directed with such pizazz be so well, boring. The title, of course, is a double-pun, nodding not only to singing, but crafting enough of a gushy love letter to the mystique and iconicity of LA to make Woody Allen wince. Here, Chapelle trips over his own earnestness. 'An aspiring actress meets a spurned jazz pianist' verges on ""Just a small town girl, livin' in a lonely world"" in the groan department, and Chazelle never musters up the gumption to deliver any reflexive reworking of the 'star-crossed lover/artists' formula whatsoever. Even the film's fake-out 'happy-ever-after-but-at-what-cost' ending, a melancholic, 'what might have been' fantasy dance break, is cheerfully poached from An American in Paris among countless others, making the film's one seeming deviance from cliché just as ensconced in cliché. {Maybe the 'La La' is really Chazelle retorting ""La La La, I can't hear you?""}That said, Chazelle's original tunes are more than worth their salt, a handful of charming, bittersweet ear-worms sure to light up iTunes for months. Occasionally, sly humour pokes through the polish - there's a great laugh to be had when Gosling's Serious Musician joining John Legend's pop-jazz-fusion band (meant to signify his artistic bankruptcy in favour of pop commercialism) produces the film's most infectiously memorable song. Still, post-Whiplash, Chazelle's one true love is still jazz, and the film's jazz club scenes come alive with more kinetic ferocity than any of its schmaltzy dance breaks. The 'non-professional singer musical' trope is ultimately a matter of personal preference (Woody Allen's Everyone Says I Love You takes this poetic accessibility to the next level) but it's effective here, thematically underscoring the dissonance of these two 'good but not amazing' dreamers slotting themselves into the iconicity of legend. It's a shame that they're further marred by consistently murky, almost distressingly amateurish sound editing, garbling the audibility of most of the song's lyrics almost past the point of comprehension. 'Naturalism' is one thing, but it's still hard to fall in love with songs we can barely hear. Still, it takes appropriately glitzy stars to own up to such a superficially pleasurable film, and it's impossible to imagine a more lovable duo than Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. Endearingly clumsy singing aside, their respective astronomical charisma easily outperform their less-than-stimulating material. Underpinning her 'adorably neurotic klutz' schtick with a smattering of raw pathos, Stone's gigantic, alien bug- eyes prove capable of expounding almost alarming deluges of emotion. Hearing her show-stopping Audition ballad is so phenomenally moving that it's almost hard to focus on her amidst brushing tears away. Similarly, Gosling proves he's able to look as winningly suave sporting a keytar and red leather jacket as ever, and he's breezy, smooth and funny enough to breathe life into his stale 'frustrated artist.' Nonetheless: restricting the superb J.K. Simmons to a fleeting cameo? Borderline criminal offence. It's curious to see a movie so obsessed with history and nostalgia playing its spate of cliché so unironically, but La La Land is such a pleasantly dopey ode to the love of creation, it's evidently easy for many to overlook. Chazelle's film is likely best enjoyed outside the spotlight of the awards hype machine, where it's easier to embrace its superfluous camp and profoundly heartfelt sweetness at face value. Still, for a world so riddled with conflict and strife, there's an unmistakable value for a film so silly - episodically on YouTube, if nothing else. Here's to the ones who dream. -7/10",La La Land,3783958
30,mhorg2018,Overrated,1/10,26 February 2017,"Much like Arrival, which the critics went gaga over and was a drama disguised as a science fiction film, the critics went gaga over this as well. Perhaps if they'd had some musically inclined people in it, rather than the cast they did, it might have kept my attention. But it didn't. I find Ryan Gosling bland, and really while I like Emma, she needs to stretch her acting muscles. The big eyed earnest waif act is wearing a bit thin. Her character in this could have been her character from Easy A, there's that little of a difference. Some critics have compared this to Singin in the Rain, but there is no comparison. That's a classic and this is just another over-hyped Hollywood movie. I'm sure some people love it. But I'm pretty sure just as many didn't.

31,Dello_,"Heart warming, highly poetic and gorgeous",10/10,21 January 2020,"""La La Land"" is a fantastic movie, better than what I could have expected before watching and it has rapidly became one of my favourite movie ever. I loved Whiplash (Damien Chazelle's previous work) but this one is something special. ""La La Land"" is about a couple and their love story, which I have to admit isn't something too particular or too original, even if I liked a lot the ending because it was something different but nothing that was never seen. The real merit of this movie is the way in which everything is portrayed, starting from the magnificent direction by Chazelle to the score by Hurwitz, including the great cinematography and all the cast. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling were both exceptional (in particular in the last 20 seconds) considering they also had to dance and sing, in which they were pretty amazing. Generally I don't like musicals but ""La La Land"" is different because first of all I found more contextualised the dancing and singing scenes than a usual musical, secondly they are gorgeous. And all the movie in particular is highly poetic because of its bright colours that warms the heart, of the music which is fantastic and so thoughtless that brings you away from your dimension to make you live two hours in this pocket universe in which you feel light and without any mass. And you look around to the bright colours and you listen to the music played and you elevate yourself like the protagonists in a memorable scene. I know that it seems like a very good trip but I wasn't high, it was just the movie that provoked me all these feelings and emotions. For this reason I loved every single moment of it and it's one of my favourite movies ever. So if you haven't watched ""La La Land"" yet, be sure to check it out. It's unlikely that everyone loves it as much as I do, but the poetic aspect of it really touched some cords in my heart, maybe will do this even for you. And if not it is however visually stunning, sweet to hear and it has an enjoyable story, so it is worth watching anyway.",La La Land,3783958
32,dave-mcclain,"""La La Land"" is a wonderful and refreshing, but imperfect film.",8/10,20 October 2016,"In real life, most people don't randomly break out in song and dance, but the escapism of the big screen has been bringing Movie Fans musical feature films since the very first days of the sound motion picture. Only the second film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture was a musical (1929's ""The Broadway Melody""). Oversaturation in the marketplace and changing audience tastes led to the production of fewer musicals, but they never went away. Some of the best-loved musicals in film history (e.g. ""Meet Me in St. Louis"" and ""Singin' in the Rain"") came out in the 10-year span 1944-1953. But the ensuing decades each produced very popular musicals: ""West Side Story"", ""The Sound of Music"" and ""Oliver!"" (all Best Picture Oscar winners from the 1960s), ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"", ""Grease"" and ""All That Jazz"" (1970s), ""Victor/Victoria"", ""Little Shop of Horrors"" and ""The Little Mermaid"" (1980s), ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""The Lion King"" and ""Evita"" (1990s) and, in the early 2000s, ""Moulin Rouge!"", ""Frozen"", ""Dreamgirls"" and ""Chicago"", which became the first musical in 34 years to win Best Picture.2016's ""La La Land"" (PG-13, 2:08) is the purest original (non-adapted) live action musical in many years, and has both the pedigree and the quality to duplicate the accomplishment of 2002's ""Chicago"". ""La La Land"" was written and directed by Damien Chazelle, who was the writer-director of 2014's ""Whiplash"", which earned him Oscar nods for his script and his film. This one is filled with original songs which are composed and orchestrated by Chazelle's previous collaborator, Justin Hurwitz, with lyrics by the award-winning musical theater team known as Pasek and Paul. Musician John Legend has a major role in the film and its stars, Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, are both past Oscar nominees who earlier appeared together in two other movies – 2011's ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" and 2013's ""Gangster Squad"". And, yes, they both sing and dance while telling this particular musical's story of romance, dreams and hope. It takes place in the present but feels like a throwback - like the most entertaining musicals of yesteryear.The film's title has a dual meaning: (1) referring to people who live their lives in a seemingly unrealistic dream world and (2) the city of Los Angeles itself, where most of the action takes place. In fact, the film opens with a song-and-dance number with commuters stuck on a typically grid-locked L.A. highway. At the very end of that scene, aspiring actress Mia Dolan (Stone) has a random, brief and unpleasant encounter with struggling jazz keyboardist, Sebastian Wilder (Gosling), who acts like a real pianist. The two run into each other again in Sebastian's jazz club, immediately after he's fired by the club owner (J.K. Simmons) for insisting on playing his own music. Sebastian is no more polite this time. The two finally ""meet cute"" and before long, Mia has left her roommates behind and moved in with Sebastian.Neither life nor love go smoothly for this pair of stubborn dreamers, but they sure do try hard at both. Mia continues working as a barista on the Warner Bros. studio lot and going to frustrating audition after frustrating audition. Eventually, she decides that her best way forward is to write, finance and produce a one-woman show which, fittingly, focuses on her experiences of leaving her hometown in Nevada and moving to La La Land to pursue her dreams. After dropping the humorously humiliating job where Mia sees him at their third encounter, Sebastian continues to hold fast to his dream of opening his own jazz club, but doesn't really do much about it. He reluctantly takes a job on keys in a music group run by an old acquaintance (Legend), but doesn't enjoy it because they don't play his style of pure jazz. Sebastian's unhappiness turns to resentment and ends up being directed toward Mia, just as her show is about to open. The eventual resolution of their love story and their individual pursuit of their dreams feels right for a movie which celebrates dreamers, but shows what happens when life doesn't go as we've planned.""La La Land"" is a wonderful movie, but not, as some reviewers would lead you to believe, flawless. After three contentious encounters, the two main characters just suddenly fall in love, a development that isn't very well earned by the script or the acting. Otherwise, the performances are excellent (especially Stone's) and the script is funny, poignant and grounded except for that whole thing about characters suddenly breaking into song. But when they do, those songs are both fun and touching. The dancing, however, seems to lack some of the energy and joy that you find in the older Hollywood musicals that inspired this film. Having said all that, I have to put these relatively minor criticisms into perspective: This is a very entertaining and affecting movie. You'll likely be emotionally invested in these characters, smile a lot – and leave the theater wanting the soundtrack. For someone who wants more variety and positivity in today's films, this one is a gift. ""A-""",La La Land,3783958
33,Subzero7,I so wanted to love this.,1/10,28 January 2017,"I went in expecting something wonderful like Chicago, or Moulin Rouge, but instead was treated to mediocre at best. The acting was good, the sound was OK, but there was nothing ""best"" about it. I don't know how it was able to garner ANY Oscar nominations. There just wasn't anything Oscar worthy about it. It was trying to had to hearken back to the days of Fred Astaire, and Ginger Rogers and failed miserably. The singing wasn't that great either. I like both of the star actors, but this just wasn't the right vehicle for them. Their singing was just OK. The songs were nothing memorable that I would want the sound track for. The only really good song was the one sung by John Legend. The City of Stars was a nice little ditty, but that about it. The whole movie from beginning to end was just underwhelming. Both my partner and I felt the same way walking out. In fact, his first words were, ""Well that's four hours we'll never get back."" I said, ""It was only two hours."" He said, ""EXACTLY."" Oh well, I guess you can't like everything.

37,zeekwunlau,Symphony of Realism and Romanticism,8/10,4 April 2020,"A changeable and free creation who once loved jazz, but chose to compromise as a keyboard player in order to give his girlfriend a stable life. One was a waiter who used to envy others in a convenience store to resign and wrote his own role. The script, and later became famous. Sometimes the path of chasing dreams is not so ""romantic"". Dreams need material support and spiritual encouragement.
When the two sat together and played the city of stars, it was actually the beginning of their upcoming separation. This song is not only a summary of the period from acquaintance to love, but also the sense of fatality that will eventually leave. From the last sentence "" i dont know where i go, i think i wanna to stay "". The most touching thing about this song is that while he points out love, he also expresses the sense of parting fatalism. There is another more wonderful point, that is, the embarrassment of the embarrassing dream chasers. When I saw this three years ago, I simply thought that the song was nice and the love was beautiful, but there was no such experience at all.
Another hidden theme-the sympathy of dream chasers, but this is what contributed to their love. This friendship of Bole is obviously more profound than love. It is also what Chamion wants to discuss.
Chamion had studied jazz drums for ten years. In high school, he met a very strict teacher, which brought him a lot of inspiration and help in jazz music. It was equivalent to his Bole. At that time, Chamion himself His dream is to become a jazz player in the future. It can be seen that jazz is simply integrated into his bones, so many people may not know why there are so many jazz elements in the film, even very professional aspects. In fact, it comes from his own experience. . His movie audiovisual language is very good, and his movie language is very rhythmic, so it is very sensation to watch the song and dance films he directed. The rhythm of the film comes from the subconscious consciousness of a drummer.
The film uses a lot of long shot scheduling. The most admirable thing about him is that he can shoot the long shot rhythm. The stage scheduling of the stage drama really makes me want to applaud in situ.
At the end of the film, the director spent a few minutes fulfilling everyone 's dream. If they did n't miss it for the first time at the beginning, if later they encouraged each other and support each other, then it 's them who built the family together today, and it 's them who have the children, They are going to play together, it is a happy ending. However, reality always lacks ""romanticism"". Reality needs idealism but often does not become idealism.
Looking at the whole movie, my favorite clip is that the male host drove to the female host's house to tell her that there was a casting interview. The female host told him that she had had enough failures, and the male host firmly said ""you can"". This kind of trust and encouragement is another kind of rebirth switch given by God. It is not perfunctory, but tells you the facts-you can, you will take this role.
In addition to the content, the film's photography and color use are simply stunning, especially the color matching is really beautiful, and it is the ultimate enjoyment of the senses.
Finally, to those with dreams, you will have city's stars",La La Land,3783958
38,ronakkotian,Hits the right notes,9/10,14 March 2020,"I'll be honest. Musicals are probably my least favourite genre. They simply do not interest me. After hearing the acclaim this film has gotten and the fact that it's directed by Damien Chazelle, I decided to give it a go. This is the best musical I've seen so far.La La Land follows Mia, an aspiring actress, and Sebastian, a pianist, who fall in love whilst trying to achieve their aspirations for the future.Before seeing the movie, I wondered what all the hype surrounding La La Land was. After watching it I was extremely impressed by Chazelle's vision for the movie as well as the performances by Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. This movie starts off with an amazing song and dance number that looks like it's done in one take and lasts for five minutes. This is just one of many astounding musical moments. Not that just but the way each scene flows into a musical number was handled immensely well. Usually when people burst into song and dance, I tend to roll my eyes but I loved every single song and dance in La La Land. The long takes, stunning camerawork and choreography made me realise how passionate Chazelle was towards filmmaking and music. It wasn't just the aesthetics but the actual songs were memorable. It's been a while since I watched the film and the songs are still playing in my head.If that already wasn't enough, the performances are stellar. I believe this is a career best performance from Emma Stone. She was fabulous. Ryan Gosling is always a win and his chemistry with Stone is perfect. Their romance is believable and you root for them through the entire journey. There is an iconic dance sequence involving them both and seeing them dance for the first time was exciting.Whilst the story isn't anything new and rather quite predictable, the message that it's trying to tell you has so much heart. Many people say this film is a love letter to LA and that is evident through the gorgeous cinematography of the city but I think it's a film for people who have dreams and want to achieve their goals to be successful in the future. Plus the film pokes fun at Hollywood through its representation of Hollywood parties and auditions.Damien Chazelle deserves all the praise for his creative vision on this film. He's slowly becoming one of my favourite directors working today. With Whiplash and La La Land, I feel he will go very far. La La Land is filled with incredible musical numbers, beautiful cinematography and terrific performances by both leads that culminates in a finale that will bring out the tissues.",La La Land,3783958
39,edwagreen,*1/2,3/10,16 September 2017,"Had this musical won the Oscar for best picture of the year, there would have been an outcry far greater than when An American in Paris won in 1951. Both these musicals suffered from a complete lack of plot.The first 90 minutes of this film is a complete waste. Gosling and Stone even killed the Oscar winning song when they sang it. Their dancing was no Fred and Ginger either.The story might have taken off once they attained success but their careers would separate them.The film by itself could put you in la-la land. This was a real sleeper of major proportions. The Academy must have been in la-la land when they were voting Stone as best actress and other awards. Warren Beatty, you're certainly vindicated for naming the wrong film, this one, as the best picture. Film needs to be put asleep.",La La Land,3783958
40,jongreatorex,Tinky Winky Land?,4/10,25 January 2017,"Lets set the parameters. An Oscar-winning film, or any above-average picture for that matter, needs to fulfil criteria that sets it apart from the 'average'. It requires a breath of innovation, story-line, integrity and impeccable acting that levitates the subject above the norm. It needs also to vault hype and financial remuneration. To create a musical, which, I believe 'La La Land' aspires in many parts to be, there has to be a synergy between book, score and choreography. Sadly, for this viewer, not one of these three elements can be considered by any stretch of the imagination,'exceptional'. It's triumph is evident in it's cinematography and lighting, which were largely outstanding. But the remainder? The story is typical Hollywood fare - predictable without significant twists or intellectual excertion. Essentially, nothing out of the ordinary happens and the blandness creeps to a predictable end. The acting is OK. You would expect as much from someone of Gosling's ability, but I hope that one day he'll be provided with a script that alienates him from the type-casting that befell Hugh Grant, with a diversity that De Nero was astute to select. Choreography? What choreography? That brief moment with the bench is all that taunts the memory. Singing - best not go there. Marni Nixon could have played both roles.And I read today that it's up for 14 Academy nominations. Figures. Trump was successful so there's no reason this will not win.Emperor's new clothes 'n all.",La La Land,3783958
41,edicionccq,A lovely movie,10/10,10 November 2019,"Finally I had the chance to watch this movie. I usually don't enjoy a lot of the movies that are nominated for the Oscars because they usually are too long and visually perfect but they don't make me feel something.La La Land manages to be perfect in every single aspect. The visuals are awesome, the music is so good, and the chemistry between Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone is so perfect that it makes me root for them.

42,simon-81093,A good effort but nothing exceptional,7/10,29 January 2017,"A modern take on the classic Hollywood musical. It baffles me how such a high profile movie can divide opinion so much with reviews here ranging from 1 – a waste of time to 10 – my best movie ever. I think the hype surrounding this movie has left a lot of people feeling robbed and angry. I went to see the movie open minded. I'll qualify my views by firstly stating I'm a male in the over 40's age bracket. I've thoroughly enjoyed movies like Grease and Moulin Rouge in the past.I would say that this film's appeal is that it's different to the 'run of the mill' Hollywood films. That could be why it's getting so much attention. Suddenly we have a new film which isn't like all the others! From that point of view it's a good effort. For the most part it does actually work quite will if you stick with it. Performances from the two lead actors are good.After the opening sequence and early stages of the movie I was unsure where it was going. However, I started to find it 'pleasant' to watch. Whilst the music score and singing are not the best, it was sufficient. However, I found the end was disappointing and left me feeling flat. I think a movie like this must have a 'happy ending'. In my view, dare I say it, this movie will appeal mostly to a female audience who appreciate something different. Decide for yourself.",La La Land,3783958
43,AfricanBro,Musical's are meant to suck,8/10,3 January 2022,"I used used to say I hate musicals but after watching Hamilton and La la land I've come to the conclusion I only hate crappy musicals. I watched la la land inadvertently, all I knew was it was nominated for and won awards so I was shocked I found out it was a musical, but I was already there so I kept on and tried to keep an open mind to maybe understand why it's so highly acclaimed. What I loved the most about la la land is even after you take all all the singing and dancing aside, it's still a good movie. I'm a sucker for romance so for a long time that's how I convinced myself I liked it; the love story it told between two struggling artists. I've now grown to admit I like it just because it's a good movie.And Hamilton. That I watched with intent, I'd heard a few songs that I liked and when I googled them I was shocked to see it was from a movie adaptation of a play. I'd been to a theatre play that I enjoyed so I was more open minded to this than la la land. I went through British curriculum in school so I never learnt about america and it's founding fathers, atleast not in detail, hence why my favorite thing about this is it felt like a fun history lesson, enjoyable way to educate yourself in under 3hrs. Unlike la la land there was no talking in between songs, the whole movie's dialogue is through them and you need to listen, fortunately the performances are stellar so I really did enjoy it. La la land was just an amazing love story, but Hamilton had romance, war, politics and the soundtrack was amazing and for that I think it'd be hard to find a better musical.",La La Land,3783958
44,pcrprimer,Delivers a fantastical take on a classic story,8/10,8 March 2020,"This film has a surreal, dream like feeling that persists throughout the movie from the opening dance number to the big number at the observatory and the big finish. Stone and Gosling carry this movie as the two main leads and both impress with their dancing and performances. Stone in particular shines, whereas Gosling is a more stoic and brooding figure. Although the ending caught me off guard, I think it makes more of an impact. The costumes, cinematography, and energy is top notch and it makes for a unique experience

45,RLTerry1,A Modern Motion Picture Musical Masterpiece!,10/10,27 December 2016,"Simply dazzling! A beautifully produced motion picture musical that is sure to delight audiences around the world. Ryan Gosling (Sebastian) and Emma Stone (Mia) shine brightly in this self- reflexive modern romantic film set on the backdrop of a classically composed movie musical echoing the song and dance numbers that Busby Berkeley brought to the silver screen through Hollywood studio system powerhouse Warner Bros. Summit Entertainment's La La Land will have you laughing one moment and crying the next in this roller coaster of emotions. Every aspiring professional who has the dream of a substantive career as an artist in the visual and performing arts--or just an artist in general--needs to watch this film. If you have ever been discouraged on your career path, or lack thereof, this film will aid in reigniting the flame that fuels your dreams of writing, acting, playing, or whatever your passion happens to be. Whereas many films similar to this one would have shot it as a period OR modern piece, this film is nothing short of a masterpiece that harnesses the nostalgic appeal of the classic musical with the power of modern cinematic storytelling.Best part about Damien Chazelle's La La Land? The old-school movie musical feel from the moment the film opens. From set pieces to matte paintings to the manner in which the cameras capture the story as the drama unfolds, this is both a modern story of romance and conflict and classic Hollywood musical. While some may find the cinematography, lighting, and editing to be nothing remarkable, the fact of the matter is that it required great skill and hundreds of hours of effort to capture the essence of an old Hollywood musical. To recreate a nearly extinct film genre, is an outstanding achievement in cinematic storytelling and deserves all the 9s and 10s this film is receiving from critics and fans alike. La La Land takes pages right out of the books of Busby Berkeley (Footlight Parade) and Gene Kelly (Singin' in the Rain). Such a gorgeous combination of a classically structured and choreographed musical within a modern Hollywood. And the film could have easily rested its laurels on the technical and artistic achievements alone, but the film also possesses an incredibly beautiful love story between two aspiring artists.In a modern studio system who appears all too often to be more concerned with franchise building, merchandising, theme park integration, and rebooting, this film is fresh, real, gritty, and endearing. In a climate so predisposed to the Star Warses, Harry Potters, Jurassic Parks, and Avengerses, this film brings with is a breath of fresh air that is nearly unmatched by any other film this year. While many are concerned with the lack of original stories coming out of Hollywood, may this film be a testament that masterpieces can still make their way into cinemas nationwide and not simply the art house theatre of the US' largest metro areas. Although film is a visual medium and should not rely upon the score or songs to carry the bulk of the film (i.e. Frozen), this film is very much about the music. However, unlike films that integrate music in order to cover up poorly structured and developed writing, La La Land embraces the music as much a part of the story as the writing itself. In many ways, the film plays out like music and flows like a musical score. The way the cameras moves, the editor cut, and the blocking of the characters is very much like a musical staff, like the way music is composed and performed. But at the same time, the movie is not simply about the music but about the relationship between Mia and Sebastian; and furthermore, about their aspirations for the spotlight. Solid writing and a solid score.The casting of La La Land could not have been more brilliant! Both Stone and Gosling successfully bring about that 1940s feel in a modern story. That could be due to the successes of both in 1940s era films prior. Stone in Magic in the Moonlight and Gosling in The Notebook. While both can successfully carry a period piece on their own respectively, together they are a powerhouse couple like Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. Their performances in this film were so incredibly natural, no real, and believable. At the same time, the actors are also very much contemporary--just like the film classic yet contemporary. Even though the audience is well aware that Stone and Gosling are anything but struggling artists, they play their respective parts so convincingly that you'd swear that we were actually watching a pair of struggling artists who do desperately want a substantive piece of that Hollywood pie. A great screenplay possesses protagonists that the audience will love or love to hate, and the characters in La La Land connect so incredibly well with classic and contemporary audiences. Inspirational. This film will help to inspire those who have a talent for storytelling, music, or writing to continue to work hard and remain dedicated to one's craft because that is the only way that a career can pay off. The moment you stop trying is the moment that the dream dies along with settling for less. Not that day-jobs aren't important. Certainly the importance of a day job is shown in the film, but it's imperative that the day job never cause an artist to sell out or give up on the dream. Day jobs should fund imaginative dreams not eclipse them. There is much to love about this film; so much so that you will likely find yourself with a desire to watch it again. This IS definitely my pick for Best Picture as we head into award season with the holidays coming to a close.",La La Land,3783958
46,davidgee,Zings ain't what they used to be,6/10,20 January 2017,"After rave reviews and the Golden Globes there's now an Oscar/Bafta buzz attached to LA :LA LAND. Sorry to rain on the big parade but I was not blown away. Yes, there's some charm here with all the homage to the Golden Age of romantic musicals, and Ryan Gosling remains the most charismatic of today's young stars, but the music simply isn't musical enough. Gosling and Emma Stone can just about carry a song and do a bit of amateur hoofing, but really the singing is nearly as ragged as it was in the screen version of LES MISERABLES and the dancing is about as far from Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly as the first round of 'Dancing With the Stars'.OK, Kelly and Astaire (and Ginger Rogers and other co-stars of theirs) did not have great singing voices, but they were fantastic dancers and the song-and-dance numbers in their movies were never less than dazzling. The closest LA LA LAND comes to dazzling is in the final routine, a low-rent tribute to AN American IN Paris, but it just doesn't have enough dazzle. As musicals go, fings ain't what they used to be. The jazz club scenes hit the only high spots. Gosling really looks as if he's creating magic on the piano, but there's no magic in his singing or his dancing – nor in Stone's, who alas doesn't have her co-star's redeeming charisma. The love-story has a certain amount of charm but, like the music, it could do with a bit more 'zing'.The Golden Age nostalgia also extends to a clunky tribute to REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE. But nostalgia just isn't enough and there's too much clunkiness on display here. They say there isn't the money to create great musicals like we had in MGM's heyday. Surely it would take only a fraction of the budget for a CGI-heavy action movie or space opera to hire some first-rate dancers and singers who can act - or, if we must, actors who can sing (or mime to a better singer)? SINGIN' IN THE RAIN cannot have been a big-budget production, but it's still the greatest of the greats.",La La Land,3783958
47,keenast,Overrated copy of Jacques Demy/Michel Legrand,1/10,11 January 2017,"It seems not too many know the French director Jacques Demy's films, especially his musicals like 'The young girls of Rochefort' or 'The umbrellas of Cherbourg' or 'Donkey Skin' - nor Michel Legrand, who scored these as well as many other films. Those were made in the late 60ies and 70ies. They are available on Netflix - highly recommended!Obviously the director of LaLaLand watched them over and over again but he failed totally in recreating them and transporting them into our times. I find the music of LaLaLand with the exception of its main song rather forgettable, the same with most of the choreography. The lead actors are OK, but I don't see any depth. The story line is rather thin, very cookie cutter and weighed down by too much sentimentality.

51,untilnow99,A film for fans of Glee?,2/10,15 January 2017,"This is a film for those who like predictable and corny song and dance romance plots. I saw the high rating and, since I love Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, I had high hopes for this flick, but . . . alas . . .I couldn't even stomach it after the first 15 or so minutes and gave up. I'm surprised I lasted that long. What a crashing bore.West Side Story or Oklahoma this ain't. I live in CA and resent the fact that this film tries to transport its inferior East Coast let's-dance-our-way-down-Broadway type schlock to our sandy shores.I honestly got the feeling that while Emma was enjoying her stint as a singing dancing out of work actress, Ryan was a complete fish out of water.

The music is beautiful, the editing was perfectly timed, the direction was excellent, the Costume Design was on the spot, the cinematography was breath taking, and the acting by Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling...wow! Just wow! We both saw Emma Stone in Superbad, and whoever would've thought she would've ended up here? There is no doubt this film will be an Oscar contender. We're hoping it will at least win an Oscar for Best Original song for ""City of Stars."" If you love Musicals then see this movie. It will possibly be the best one you ever. Take your kids, take your parents and Grandparents...you will have the time of your life! Autistic Reviewers give this 5/5 stars, 10/10.

The story is grotesquely poor and without logic. Gosling is pathetic, I kept wanting someone to slam the keyboard cover down on his hands, Stones voice left me praying for a good dose of pharyngitis. In short neither can sing or dance yet the Hollywood promo machine keep telling us how great it is and people believe it. In short i wasted 2 hours, 7 minutes and 3 seconds of my life.

55,tavm,La La Land was quite realistic for an original musical but also fantastic in some sequences,9/10,25 January 2017,"Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend who saw it before and said it was okay. The movie seems to want to be both realistic and fantasy-laden as evidenced by the location shots for the former and the more imaginative set designs for the latter. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling are the leads and they both seem believable enough playing a real-life couple trying to live their dreams and also to please each other but it seems they can't do both. The original songs are pretty entertaining and their voices are, well, serviceable for their characters. Part of me did wonder if the praise was worth it but by the end, it brought a smile to me face even if the ending was not a ""happily ever after"" one. So that's a recommendation for La La Land. Oh, and glad it just got 14 Oscar nominations!

57,msbreviews,Rating: A+,10/10,6 August 2017,"At the very beginning of every year, I write a list of all of the movies that I've been anticipating for a long time (mostly based on comic-books) and those that either have a good premise, a good director and/or a good cast. La La Land didn't have a release date in January (I think), but even if they had, I'd have probably left it out (maybe I did). I don't have a least favorite genre, I enjoy watching every type of movie, but musicals are by far the ones that I find to be less interesting or even well-made so, even with a great director and cast, I only got the urge to watch this film because of all of the Oscar talk and the beautiful soundtrack that I've been listening to in the last couple of days ...Perfect. Magic. Absolutely stunning. I don't have words to describe how AMAZING Chazelle's direction is. I mean, anyone can enjoy this film because it IS great entertainment, but the amount of work that they had with this MASTERPIECE is unbelievable. Extremely LOOOOONG takes, over and over again, with excellent synchronized choreography and an original score to remember forever and ever. Every single shot drops such marvelous quality that I kept being surprised every single scene. This is the best directing skills that I've seen from a director since God knows when. Congratulations, Damien Chazelle. You won yourself an Oscar, a Golden Globe and every other award that honors the man behind everything.Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are incredible and I can't imagine any other actors portraying their roles. Gosling is the usual funny, charming and loving guy, while Emma Stone definitely has her career- best performance (even better than on Birdman), worthy of many awards. The way they interpret the songs is so captivating and emotional that they just make the music even greater (watching besides listening gives it such a more compelling meaning). The score is so beautiful and heartfelt that it's impossible to explain through words the feelings one has as listening to them ... Just fantastic.My only concern with the movie was the romance and the overall story, I thought it would be super cliché and follow the usual paths that this type of films have ... Nop. Even the story is great. I mean, I don't want to spoil anything, but let me just say that cliché is not a word that I'll use to describe this movie. It doesn't follow anything, it has its own original story and the romance is super smooth as the actors' terrific performances. It FEELS real.I never thought I'd say this, ever, but ... La La Land is (probably) the best film of 2016 and my favorite, for sure. One of the best direction I've ever seen from anyone (please, Damien Chazelle keep going!), an absolutely pitch-perfect duo (Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone have a perfect chemistry), a fantastic non-cliché original story about pursuing dreams and the most beautiful and heartfelt soundtrack that I'll listen over and over again for God knows how long ... Magical. Rememberable. I can't wait to watch it again!!!MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)",La La Land,3783958
58,DJAkin,Reminded me of the Golden Age of Hollywood,9/10,30 April 2017,"First of all, this movie is not a complete musical. There is a lot of singing and dancing but the movie has a lot of normal dialog as well. The opening scene is very neat and is basically one long shot that takes place on the LA freeway, with everybody singing and dancing. It has nothing to do with the rest of the movie though.I liked how the opening also had the ""Filmed in Cinemascope"" at the beginning. That gave you that ""old school"" feeling right away. There were many great locations in the movie that make you want to travel to LA and just hang out in jazz clubs. Speaking of Jazz Clubs, I really liked how J.K Simmons had a small role at the jazz club, considering he played a jazz instructor in WHIPLASH. I really love the chemistry between Mia (Emma Stone) and Sebastian (Ryan Gosling). It was such a nod to the old Hollywood classics. Emma is such a wonderful actress and captivating on screen. She will probably be playing great roles for many years to come. The ending was actually very very well done and had a bittersweet twist to it. Finally, at the VERY end, they show the words ""THE END"" which also bring back great memories of movie watching days gone by.",La La Land,3783958
59,w-71474,Colorful dreams,10/10,12 April 2020,"The title ""La La Land"" is wonderful. This word is a common word in English. Webster's dictionary define ""La La Land"" as the following: ""an euphoric dreamlike mental state detached from the harsher realities of life"", that is, a blissful mental state that is general in dreams and free from cruel reality. In my opinion, this seemingly cute and unintentional word describes the story in the film very accurately and concisely, and also summarizes a message that the film wants to convey to the audience. In addition, La La Land is also an alias for LA Los Angeles where the story of the film is located. Los Angeles, the city of stars, countless young people come to Hollywood to find their dreams, and the dreams of countless people are shattered here. However, there are always people looking for dreams, and some people are young. The starlight in this city will never be dim, and it seems that it will always be so beautiful.

60,CubsandCulture,An all time classic musical,10/10,24 March 2020,"This is like a great 50's MGM musical was made in 2016 and I simply cannot understand how anyone would dislike the film. It has everything a musical should have. There's the two appealing and darling lovebirds to follow. Striking and visual pleasant colors and direction that make the film a cinematic experience from beginning to end. And the score is beltable, lush and with with iconic songs. This is like the platonic ideal of movie musicals.Best of all the script has a relative sophistication to it; there's a troubling ambiguity about how the film feels about Seb and him being way to into jazz. In fact the script, more or less, acknowledges that he is a bit a prig. Indeed the film leaves the distinct impression that the romance was sacrificed on the alter of personal ambition. It is annoying how the Oscar race simplified this film.In the end this is one of the great musicals.",La La Land,3783958
61,kermitkid,Robbed of Best Picture,8/10,30 March 2020,"I can see why this won Best Picture, even if it was only for 30 seconds. This film was fantastic! I'm not usually a fan of live-action musicals, which is why I waited to rent this one, but this was a great movie! Although, it is a little pretentious and narcissitic, but hey, it's an Oscar-nominated film. That's the very definiton. Given that this is the only movie that I've seen Ryan Gosling in, I can't really compare his role in this film to previous works, so for what I got it was great. His singing is pretty good. And now we move to Emma Stone. As far as acting goes, she was fantastic, but her singing ability is average, and at times a bit off key. I've heard better, but I've definietely heard worse. This movie goes into date-night movie territory, but never chick flick territory, thank goodness. (Hey, I'm a guy. I'm not the target audience for those). Overall this was a fun romp, and it deserved every award it was nominated for and won with the exception of Best Costume Design. (What costumes? It's just regular clothes.) The story was pretty good, the chemistry between Gosling and Stone was believable, although sometimes the drama and arguments were a bit overacted, and the choreography and songs were awesome! I am going to be listening to the soundtrack on repeat for a long time. I cannot get these songs out of my head. It's a mix of jazz, pop, funk, a little bit of everything.

62,ronniehrubin,Don't waste your time!,1/10,3 January 2017,"This movie is not good. The high reviews are probably studio people or friends and family of all the cast & crew involved in this film! I really like both Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, but neither can carry a tune in this movie! I'm not saying these two needed to be Shirley Jones and Frank Sinatra, but at least find 2 people that can sing!! We know Emmy Rossum can sing and they could have cast Patrick Wilson. For a musical, it's not just star power, the leads have to be able to sing! (or at least dub some beautiful voice in, like they did for Natalie Wood in West Side Story).Plus, the story is quite boring and very slow. Girl meets boy, girl gets boy. Girl loses boy. (Yawn!!) Then there's the issue of maybe only one semi-catchy tune, add that to the boring story and you've got yourself a snooze-fest. Which no self respecting ""musical"" should ever be. JK Simmons is really good in the 2-3 minutes he's in the movie, but no one else is even remotely memorable. In a role any male actor could have played, they waste Tom Everett Scott. By the way, the opening production number is very clever, but the song is not good by any means. I've already forgotten the tune or even the name of the song! The story isn't worth summarizing here as it's too boring to repeat. Very, very disappointing! Don't waste your money and wait for it to hit cable.",La La Land,3783958
63,MrDHWong,An affectionate tribute to the Hollywood musicals of decades past,9/10,22 February 2017,"La La Land is a musical film written and directed by Damian Chazelle (Whiplash) and starring Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. I'll admit musicals are a guilty pleasure of mine, but it's been a while since I last saw one that I really got into. Thankfully, La La Land has done just that, with its memorable songs and clever choreography.In the city of Los Angeles, aspiring actress Mia Dolan (Emma Stone) meets aspiring Jazz pianist Sebastian Wilder (Ryan Gosling) and the two fall in love. Throughout the course of their relationship, the couple strive harder and harder to make something of their potential careers in the fast-paced and surreal city.The film plays off as an affectionate tribute to the Hollywood musicals of decades past, complete with stylish dance choreography and bombastic set pieces. Also, despite its jovial tone and brightly-coloured presentation, there are plenty of bittersweet moments that prevent the film from becoming too sappy and overly sentimental. The songs were all great and they all segued perfectly into the plot. The chemistry between both Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling is fantastic. Both actors seem like they were having a blast filming their dancing and singing scenes.I rate it 8.5/10",La La Land,3783958
64,aharmas,Dreams Don't Come True,5/10,20 December 2016,"""La La Land"" has been receiving dozens of accolades about its look, its stars, its love of musicals, and its ability to transport us to a world long gone from the American movies. Damien Chazelle exploded in the movie scene with ""Whiplash"", a movie that burst with emotions, music, and strong performances. In fact, music was a living character, a force that captured the protagonists souls and bewitched the audience. It seemed only natural that Chazelle would try a more ambitious project, a full-fledged musical, inspired by the golden age of musical, and that somehow would keep his feet on the ground.Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling play a couple of dreamers who fall in love in the city of dashed dreams. By the time they meet, she has been to too many auditions which led nowhere. He's a lover of jazz, a form of music that doesn't really appeal to the masses, but it is his obsession, and he doesn't appear to be the compromising type. He finds himself often, and he chooses to ignore practicality over dreams. Maybe that's what attracts him to the aspiring actress, or maybe it's the fact that she is a looker and a charmer, with a dash of innocence.The film has them going to parties full of vapid personalities and possible contacts. These parties are at best hollow, expendable, and also serve as backdrop or props for the next musical number. There were times when I wondered how these two characters managed to even become guests in those settings. There are many ""holes"" in this musical, and too many instances where one feels like the team is trying too hard to show creativity. He drives an old, loud, and hip convertible. She somehow can afford a Prius with what appears to be a part time job as a barista in, check this, a movie studio.Musicals are about dreams and don't stress reality and accuracy over dreams and the magic of its music and sets, but even ""Singing in The Rain"" didn't hold back in its portrayal of the negative in Hollywood. It didn't hold back when showing the prototypes in the parties, and at best, you were part of the help if you ever made into a ""party"". We have seen spontaneous and magical musical numbers take over reality in many films, the ones in here fall short in many ways.Much has been said about the ""freeway"" opening number, and I wanted to like it a lot, but there was no fire in the performances, the dancing, or the quite boring setting. There wasn't any particular challenges in the dancing, and the lyrics felt amateurish at best. It wasn't a good beginning for a musical because it didn't even hint at better things to come.""La La Land"" improves as it goes on, but the quality of the lyrics remains a problem. The melodies in the smaller numbers fare better, almost approaching lovely a couple of times, and since it's a fantastic with touches of realism, it's pretty sad. The only time I felt like I was really witnessing magic was the bit in the Observatory, conveniently opened after closing hours, and when we're given the alternate ""take"" on what their lives could have been.Emma is lovely, and Ryan does a good job portraying the jazz piano player. Romance and chemistry register, and there are moments that show the director and writer understands the world of entertainment, but it also reveals that there's a limit to what he knows. It pains me to compare it ""Singing in The Rain"", but that other movie had its heart and mind in the right place, an exuberant song and dance piece that had insights on what lied in the heart of the beast, showing the duplicity in the hearts of some of the members of this world. Dreams came across loud and clear, in vibrant colors. The hunger to belong and be more successful was apparent in the physical routines. ""Fame"" which portrayed the world of the aspiring singers and dancers bursts with physical force in all of its numbers. It never needs to call attention to itself.Maybe the problem is that for a musical about making it and trying to keep dreams and love alive in the city of dreams, it does not offer much in the way of magical settings. The brush around the Observatory is not pretty, especially the first time we see them dancing. There are hints of greatness, but they come too far in between.Maybe we want to like it too much, but let's be honest it scores big in effort. It doesn't do too well with the finished project. I kept having flashes of ""The Artist"", ""Fame"", ""Singing in The Rain"", films that delivered in quality both lyrically and visually. I wasn't angry, just disappointed because I wanted to like it more. Maybe a bit more time rehearsing, getting a better lyricist, focusing more, etc. could have made its heart beat with a stronger, more interesting form of energy.",La La Land,3783958
65,Quietb-1,Brave and brilliant movie making.,9/10,13 December 2016,"Here's a modern original take on the Hollywood movie musical. You remember when the stars broke into song and or dance. It's bright colorful and a treat for the visual and audio senses.The director is going to get much of the credit for making this work. Emma Stone gives an award worthy performance as the insecure girl wanting to live her dream. Maybe she stares into the distance a bit too often.Everything about this production is outstanding. The costumes, the music even the poster is beautiful.The movie takes advantage of the big screen and should be enjoyed in a theater environment. Maybe audiences would have preferred the alternate ending that was cleverly presented. No drugs, sex or violence, just a great time at the movies.",La La Land,3783958

68,elicopperman,Here's to the Fools Who Dream,10/10,13 February 2018,"In 2016, writer/director of Whiplash, Damien Chazelle, scored big at film festivals and theaters during the holiday season with one of the biggest hits of 2016, La La Land. Regarded as a luscious tribute to musicals of the 40s and 50s, this film has become a critical darling and audiences have warmed up to it ever since it played theatrically in December 2016. Not only that, but it broke a new record at the Golden Globes by winning almost if not all the categories, from best motion picture in the comedy or music section, to best actor and best actress, to best director, to best screenplay, etc. While the movie is still a phenomenal piece of art, it's also the perfect movie to watch on valentine's day. How is it better to watch it on that said holiday as opposed to just any other day? Well, it's quite simple really. The movie is a romantic-dramedy about two struggling artists, Sebastian Wilder (Ryan Gosling) and Mia Dolan (Emma Stone). The former is someone trying to bring traditional jazz back to the modern day crowd whereas the latter is an aspiring actress who comes close to giving up from failed audition after failed audition. After several dates and discussions about the magic of motion pictures, music, and acting, Mia is convinced to make her own play and even do more auditions, where Sebastian gets a gig with a hip-hop/jazz group that soon become a hit. The perseverance from these two can really make one root for them as their dreams are quite common to several artists who just want to entertain and do what they love. Even with countless struggles and failures, it's best to not give up, for you will still rise like Maya Angelou even when you feel like there's no point. While their relationship does have its troubles, it's meant to be a more realistic yet intriguing approach to two artists learning about each other. Their passions are what really give the movie its heart and soul, both in style and in substance. The aspiring musician and aspiring actress may have different views of entertainment, but they're still artists who care about making a difference nonetheless.  Mia and Sebastian have a lot of chemistry together; while Mia is more into theater and acting than music or jazz, Sebastian shows her how jazz musicians speak thru their instruments whether it be from their practice or improvised performances. When Mia gives Sebastian a tour of Hollywood movie sets, that's where they begin to express their passions to each other and begin to warm up as a couple. Sebastian advises Mia to make her own play, but that doesn't mean he can be there with his fame and music gigs. The real emotional side of the film lies in the conflicts between their passions. Due to their passions being different, their moments of glory sadly intertwine their relationship and it even toggles their hopes for getting their own careers in the first place. As my 12th grade creative writing teacher once said, ""As old fantasy Hollywood musical as it seems, it's also realistic in it's portrayal; it doesn't always work out"". That's why the emotions of the movie really pay off, it deals with something many people may go through. Just because one has a decent career going for them doesn't mean they can always be with their loved ones, and that's where the realism in the romance angle pays off. Love is not like a Disney picture as it's more complicated to sustain for some, but the heart from both characters are still there, and caring is what got them their dreams in the first place. And then there's the film's tribute to classic jazz, theater drama and Broadway, and musicals of the 40s and 50s. The musical numbers were composed by the film's composer, Justin Hurwitz, with lyrics written by musical theater composing team, Pasek and Paul, and they really understand the beauty and amazement of Broadway and motion picture musicals. The musical numbers from Another Day of Sun, to Someone in the Crowd, to the Oscar winning City of Stars bring out the movie its upbeat, whimsical, and timeless feel that will make this film worth being up there with classics like Singin' in the Rain and West Side Story that would really make people dance in their seats. The Fools Who Dream really creates an emotional and character driven arch for Mia as well. The singing from Gosling and Stone is nothing fantastic at first, especially with the song A Lovely Night, but it warms up as the film goes on, and it fits as they build up to persevere in their dreams and to support one another. The Planetarium segment is pure visual delight and is ""pretty referential by trying hard to refer back to those old Hollywood films"" stated creative writing teacher. But the one musical number that really shines throughout the continuation of the film is Mia and Sebastian's Theme, as it progresses the optimistic tone of the film while giving Ryan Gosling a real showcase of his piano talents. Don't be surprised if you find a lot to enjoy in terms of the musical numbers, let alone dancing to them. But I think the main reason this film is the perfect film to watch on valentine's day is not only because it's a love story, but it's a more optimistic and hopeful one. Since this film is about two rising entertainers who despite constant struggles and dilemmas still make it big one way or another, it ends up being quite relatable to anyone who started off struggling at the bottom before making it to the top. The determination and bravery Mia and Sebastian have really sells the movie, and the theme of never giving up and always finding support really pays off. Support is the best thing anybody can use when trying to make a name for themselves, and that's why it's best to not look down upon your closest friends when they help you make it somewhere, everything happens for a reason. And that's why the film feels like such a love letter, it says that you can still make a living out of whatever passion you have just as long as you don't forget about the ones that helped you get there. Complete with a special ending of realization and wonderment at the end that won't be spoiled, take it upon yourself to view this optimistic and bright feature with your soul mate anytime you choose.",La La Land,3783958

I don't really know what to write about the film, except that I fell in love with it after about half an hour, and I can't put my finger on why. And not being able to set your finger on it may just be a quality that surpasses so many other more verbalizable qualities. Well, the acting was top notch, the story touching and sweet in the best possible sense, the dialogue funny, the musical numbers did not seem out of place (as one might have feared), and if Gosling doesn't have the greatest singing voice ever, he has the ability to make it work to perfection anyway, sort of like the young James Stewart when he soldiered through Cole Porter's ""Easy to Love."" As for the ending – well, I cried. I don't mind admitting it. Or, yes I do, but I admit it anyway. And I'm an old and unsentimental guy, not unlike Dickens' Ebenezer Scrooge, but I did shed a tear. It was when that ""la-la-la-la-la-la-la"" started again near the end as one might have expected it would, and on came the waterworks.

I found the film extremely slow moving and it did not hold my attention. The story line was weak and it had me hoping it would improve. It did not improve and I walked out with about 40 minutes of the film remaining. Considering the exceptional reviews and ratings this film has been getting I was sorely disappointed. Films like Singing in the Rain are musicals. This is not even a fraction of a musical. I am an avid film goer and consider that I have enough musical knowledge, coming from a musical background, to give such judgments. I notice one other reviewer stated this could be classed as a poor man's Woody Allen film and I totally agree. Last year I saw The Cafe Society and this had far greater costumes, acting, depth and music .

74,eddie_baggins,The film of the year. A true piece of cinematic magic,10/10,8 December 2016,"Ladies and gentleman, boys and girls, I present to you what very well could (and should) be this years Best Picture winner; La La Land.From the films incredibly choreographed opening scene, La La Land becomes an eye catching, toe-tapping and most importantly of all joyous movie going experience and the film transforms a story that at its core is rather generic into something else entirely, that will very likely place La La Land into the top echelon of cinematic musicals, as well as a classic of our time.Quite the feat then for third time feature film director Damian Chazelle.Announcing himself to the film world with his sweat-inducing drummer thriller Whiplash in 2014, La La Land is Chazelle stamping himself into the ranks of the great directors working in the industry today.The jazz loving artist is a talent worth all the praise he receives, as every thread of Chazelle's love letter to Hollywood, jazz, romance and perhaps most importantly of all, dreaming, is a pure piece of cinematic ecstasy.Alongside DOP Linus Sandgren (whose work here may well lead to a hefty individual awards haul this season), his composer Justin Hurwitz and genuinely the whole team behind this production, Chazelle has crafted up that rare movie beast, a unique tapestry of brilliance that practically bounces along frame to frame and is matched majestically by its two leads, who in turn give us a duo of characters we are unlikely to forget anytime soon.Tasked with not only reigniting the chemistry they shared in the likable 2011 romantic comedy Crazy Stupid Love and the 2013 Gangster Squad but pulling off the unenviable task of singing and dancing their way into the moviegoers hearts, Emma Stone as the big dreaming wannabe actress Mia and Ryan Gosling as jazz loving hard-done-by musician Sebastian make for a lovable on screen duo whose relationship together is all at once alluring, believable and at times heartbreaking.The bond between these two starry-eyed lovers is one you can't help but be swept up by as their individual plights and plans take shape, so do our affections towards them as Mia and Sebastian become one of the modern era's most engaging on screen couples.The two actors are, safe to say, equally deserving of awards, yet as good as Gosling is in a role he seemed tailor made to play this is in many ways Stone's true star making turn that will be nigh on impossible for any of her naysayers to deny. She can no longer just be the lovable redhead from Easy A or Zombieland or the lucky to be there Oscar nominee from Birdman.In another year where Natalie Portman didn't too give what appears to be the performance of her career, the Best Actess would've been Stone's for the taking (Stone's rendition of the film's key song Audition is a true showstopper and proof enough of this) but regardless of the results of such statue giving, Stone's layered turn here is one for the ages.There's a lot more to be said about this spellbinding romance that just so happens to express itself through its songs and music as well as its very setting but at the end of the day for anyone that calls themselves a movie lover, La La Land is a brilliantly conceived big screen experience unlike anything we've seen before and a true big screen must-see.In a year of largely forgettable and cookie cutter experiences, Chazelle's love letter to film, the city of lights and following your dreams should be something that's savoured and enjoyed not only in the coming months, but for years yet to come.5 observatory waltzes out of 5",La La Land,3783958
75,Thunderbuck,"Yes, legitimately great",10/10,18 February 2017,"Okay, big deal, they've made an original Hollywood musical for the first time in decades, and the music is okay, and it's all a big L.A. love-fest. Ho-hum.BUT... La La Land really IS that good, even if it doesn't immediately present itself as anything more than a fluffy confection. This takes its place comfortably with ""An American in Paris"" (to which it pays considerable homage).To me this is kind of a ""guerilla musical""; most of the shots seemed to source from hand-held cameras. It's a low-budget production that frequently uses lighting effects that would be at home in a high school musical. There's little in the way of purpose-built sets and heavy use is made of locations with showbiz-themed murals and the like.The movie is set in present-day Los Angeles, and fits the classic romantic comedy rags-to-riches template. Neither lead is either a great dancer or a great singer, but the characters are engaging and they're having so much damn fun that it's easy to get pulled in.This is a sticky-sweet L.A. love story, presented without a whit of irony, and its sincere cheer is infectious. The original music is nice and catchy and both Gosling and Stone present fun, relatable characters.***SPOILER*** Where La La Land goes from escapist confection to truly great is in the final number, a bittersweet composition that re-imagines the story of Nia and Sebastian with some crucial differences. It's an expression of regret and longing and somehow makes a meaningful comment about the ways we want to reshape reality. The ending is note-perfect.Lovely movie. Worth the hype.",La La Land,3783958

This movie reminded me of the musicals I saw when I was little (since I haven't watched one in years) and why these kind of movies are so lovely. The performances are on spot and of high quality, really gave me the sense of realism. Also the soundtrack is marvelous with songs like ""City of Stars"", ""A Lovely Night"", ""Another Day of Sun"" or ""The Fools who Dream"". The cinematography was a delight... so many wonderful pictures and the mood that they were shot on gave the movie more realism (as if it didn't have enough already). The story was good... but sometimes felt a little bit sudden. And this is my only issue with the movie. There were some scenes that just happened without some good context to them... and I was like: ""ok how did we get here?"" but it didn't bothered me so much so that it could ruin the experience I had with this movie. Also there moments in which I was like: ""This is gonna happen next!"" Buy again it didn't bothered me or made me feel I was wathing a predictable movie. The execution was what made me enjoy it, even though some scenes were predictable. There was even some comic relief in it but it never seemed forced or in there just for the sake of being in there (like most of the recent Marvel movies). There is a scene at the end that will make most people cry... no spoilers here... I almost did and it was so surprising to see this type of scene done like it was done here, in a musical movie but it worked wonderfully to enhance the heart that this movie had.Overall a wonderfull movie that I longed to see it for quite some time now since it won 6 oscars this year.

Their attempt will prove to be much harder than expected, putting their relationship in peril multiple times.It's a joyful but dramatic musical which presents two ordinary people with big dreams and their struggle to achieve them. It makes the viewer pass through multiple feelings, from excitement and fun all the way to sadness and drama, keeping him into its majestic atmosphere until the end. This is a very good example of how a movie should be done, how to shoot scenes, how to build characters and how to put them into place. The music and dancing also play a very important role in the act, making it easier for the characters to express their feelings while also changing the mood of the scene.It's a very good movie without any doubt, but what disappointed me was the way the producers decided to end it. You may accuse me of being old-school and a fan of the fairy-tales for preferring a predictable happy- ending but I truly think that it would have been the best approach when it comes to this one. You may like the way it ends. You might even consider it to be a happy ending. who knows?

80,zkonedog,"Wonderful Hollywood Throwback, But With A Modern Touch",10/10,27 February 2017,"Before the fracturing of cinema into targeted genres, there was a time when the general concept of ""entertainment"" was paramount. All ages went to the theater together, so the imperative to give ""a little something to everyone"" was first and foremost on filmmakers' minds. ""La La Land"" is a throwback to that style of movie production--a rollicking musical that also features a solid plot and interesting characters.For a very basic overview, ""La La Land"" tells the story of two young people trying to make a go of it in Los Angeles: Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) is a jazz musician with a dream of opening his own club. Mia (Emma Stone) is an aspiring actress who never seems to have any luck in her auditions. After a few chance meetings, however, they discover that it may take their beliefs in each other to make those individual dreams come true.First and foremost, ""La La Land"" is a musical to its very bones. Much (dare I say most) of the emotion and character development is portrayed through song-and-dance numbers, which run the gamut from jazz and big band to orchestral and popular. Justin Hurwitz creates a soundtrack/score that is truly one of the best I have encountered in my cinematic travails. I can all but guarantee you'll be listening/singing/humming the tunes here for days, weeks, or potentially longer after viewing.At the same time, however, ""La La Land"" is not vapid in any sense. Its story of perseverance, the power of relationships, and dream-fulfillment is endemic to the human condition, and director Damien Chazelle is able to expertly weave such themes within the musical numbers. The songs, dances, plots, and characters all intertwine to create a perfect tapestry of emotion.It doesn't hurt that the chemistry between leads Gosling and Stone is absolutely off-the-charts--truly the stuff of legends. Again, a sort of throwback to the Old Hollywood studio systems where leading men & women were often thrust together in multiple pictures. The Gosling-Stone combination was cultivated through previous pairings of their own, and that familiarity comes to a perfect crescendo here.Overall, I consider ""La La Land"" to be a very deserving full-star effort. It may not make any groundbreaking political, racial, or societal statements, but every time I watch I'm instantly pulled into its fun atmosphere and endearing messages. Sometimes, a film--even in today's fractured cinema environment--can simply be ""all about the entertainment factor"", and in that capacity ""La La Land"" is at the top of my list.",La La Land,3783958
81,Maleplatypus,Sum of correctly done parts does not make a correct movie,4/10,2 March 2017,"Although this movie is probably about pursuing one's dreams and sacrifices (necessary?) in the process, it ended up as a lousy musical (with good music). It's also dedicated to some (golden?) era in Hollywood when musical was the best there is in the industry. So, instead of a clear emotional story of two ""star crossed lovers"", we've got collision of dreams of two egoists who think their individual success is more important than than anything else. It isn't. It's just that could not reconcile one type of emotion (craving for fame) with another (love). Direction is not bad (however not as good as in Whiplash) and everything has been ""watered down"" with two miscast main actors who cannot sing (and acting itself is also doubtful). Ending of the story was predictable and probably many Hollywood staff would recognize itself here. As for the musical, unfortunately I liked only ""Sweeny Todd"" (meaning that it could not function in any other form). Summary: Worth a look, but soon to be forgotten (despite the hype). Four stars for cinematography.

82,iguth,La La awesome,10/10,27 April 2019,"La La Land is gorgeous. If you like film, see it and realize why it had so many Oscar nominations. First of all the movie has basically two characters, Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling's characters are the central focus and it works. They both get nearly equal screen time in order to show off their amazing acting. Not only do they show off their acting, but also dancing and singing, all of which is beautifully sung and choreographed. (This especially applies to Ryan who learned to play piano beautifully just for this movie.) The plot is sweet, romantic, and I always love a tragedy. My favorite aspect of the film are the visuals and the pacing. The movie focuses a lot on color and uses that to paint a fantastical image of Hollywood without being to direct. It helps the plot and determines the mood. The pacing is also perfect; the use of seasons to separate periods of Seb and Mia's relationship works and is timed like they could be chapters in a book. It has a plot that could have been a book integrated with cinematography and musical aspects that I have never seen in a film together.",La La Land,3783958
83,tomgillespie2002,Feels both traditional and contemporary,8/10,28 April 2017,"There was a time I remember, sometime during the mid-to-late '90s, when the idea of watching a musical was laughable. It was a silly trend that was once popular with the movie-going audience back when cinema was relatively primitive, which saw a kitschy revival in the '70s and '80s with the likes of Grease (1978) and Xanadu (1980), but died a death when the rapid evolution of CGI made anything possible on screen. Then came Moulin Rouge! and its use of modernised classic tunes in 2001, and movie-goers have been in love with the genre again ever since. Its popularity shows no sign of stopping either, and writer/director Damien Chazelle, who made a big impression in 2014 with the excellent Whiplash, has sculpted one of the best musicals of recent times with the Oscar-nominated La La Land, a film that manages to feel both traditional and contemporary.The film combines two elements clearly dear to Chazelle: The lavish musicals of the 1950s (and to a lesser degree the '40s), and pure jazz. The two wandering souls at the story's centre dream of leaving their mark in their respected fields, but both are in love with the past in industries always looking forward. Actress Mia (Emma Stone) spends time between humiliating and soul-crushing auditions serving coffee near a studio lot, where she occasionally crosses paths with a glamorous star as the rest of the room whisper excitedly. Musician Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) cannot resist ignoring the festive playlist at his restaurant haunt in favour of some improvisation on the piano - much to the annoyance of his boss Bill (J.K. Simmons) - while he dreams of opening his own traditional jazz bar. Sebastian is quick- tempered, neurotic, and plain rude, but Mia pursues him anyway. They fall in love, and express their feelings through impromptu song-and- dance routines.Chazelle knows the genre inside out, and seems to favour the lavish MGM musicals and the glamorous physicality of the era's stars such as Gene Kelly, Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. Opening with a near one-shot song-and-dance routine, beautifully photographed by Linus Sandgren, it goes on to deliver many dazzling and classical numbers, which are often glorious to behold and backed by a soundtrack of memorable tunes that manage to stay in your head for days afterwards. They are performed admirably by the central pair, who have real chemistry. One of the few saving graces of the Amazing Spider-Man films was the chemistry between Stone and Andrew Garfield, and here she sizzles with Gosling. It's the movie's main strength. Rather than merely go through the motions and familiar tropes, you really want them to be together. You can truly feel their happiness every time they see each other.La La Land stutters when exploring deeper, more complex themes. The second act sees the two achieve some degree of success, with Mia developing a one-woman show and Sebastian joining up with a fellow musician played by John Legend in a band making waves in the world of jazz. Will Mia ultimately degrade herself in order to make it in a brutal industry that may not deserve her, and how can Sebastian, a hardcore old-schooler, be happy in a flashy group looking to move the genre forward? It seems like a poor excuse to simply tear the couple apart to experience their inevitable rough patch, and doesn't really fully explore the characters' emotional quandaries. But this slight lag doesn't last for very long, and the final moments are simply perfect. One of the great things about Whiplash was that final, heart- pounding moment of physical and spiritual triumph, and La La Land wraps up the story with grace and genuine tugs on the heartstrings. proving itself to be much more than a mere homage.",La La Land,3783958
84,pjgs200,La La Land is the perfect film.,10/10,16 June 2018,"The first time I watched La La Land, I thought it was good, but not amazing. The more I thought about it (and after a re-watch or two), it just got better and better. At the moment, La La Land is my favorite film, ever. If I had to describe it in just a few words, La La Land is magical. It makes you feel joy, heartbreak, and hope throughout its running time, and it's endlessly entertaining and re-watchable. It's an homage to Hollywood, LA, and movies in general with great lead performances, truly phenomenal cinematography, and an incredible score that will stick with you for a long time. I watched the film a year and a half ago, and the music is still stuck in my head. I really can't pick a favorite scene, since the film is just so good, but Mia's Audition towards the end of the movie was the one that impressed me the most. Stone's performance was wonderful, and pretty much anyone can relate to the song she's singing. I also think that making everything else but Mia fade to black in that scene is a smart choice. Not only does it look great, but it makes sure that the only thing we focus on is Stone's performance and the words to the song. I don't know if I did La La Land justice with this review, but it's nothing short of a masterpiece. I didn't think too much of it the first time I saw it, but the more I thought about it and watched it, the better and better it got. Note: You know a film is great when it has an 8.1 on IMDb and most of the one-star ratings say ""I just rated it this low to bring the score down.""",La La Land,3783958

86,paraplunaa,Great Actors!!,8/10,24 April 2020,"I thought it was a great movie. The plot did start out a bit laborious but it got better throughout. I had the feeling that there wasn't really a storyline in the beginning. But i'm glad I sat it out to see the rest of the movie because it was worth it. Obviously Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are so well played together, because they did two other movies together before this one. The music is obviously amazing, I just got new earbuds so it was even better haha. I really love how the characters kinda 'flow' with the music while their bodies move with the music, right on 'beat' every time. So even though the 'musical movie' genre is not my thing i still loved it.

87,TheMovieDiorama,La La Land will always be remembered as the film that nearly got Best Picture.,10/10,24 February 2018,"Now, as most of you know, I dislike musicals. Randomly bursting into song is just not to my taste, at all. Then La La Land came along and I consistently read ""overrated"", ""boring"" and ""snoozefest"" by most amateur reviewers. After literally just watching this, I can confidently say instantaneously, La La Land is phenomenal. Oh. My. Word. I love it when I'm wrong, and I was so wrong about this. I cannot fault it. I have fallen in love with La La Land. You could say I've gone la la for it! Where to even begin!? This isn't just a musical. This is a homage to classic cinema, an endearing tribute to all those silver screen masterpieces that have moulded Hollywood to what it is today. Dive beneath the glossy surface and I found myself experiencing a story about fulfilling dreams, pursuing passions and just live life to its fullest. It evoked pure joy from me, genuine happiness. I have never smiled and teared up simultaneously to a film before, ever. Yet Damien Chazelle went and only done that. His direction was absolutely outstanding. From the gorgeous long takes to the vibrant colour usage. He deserved every award. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling both gave magically enigmatic performances, particularly the former who mesmerised me with her solo audition performance. The choreography during the dance sequences defines classy, imitating the classic pairing of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. The soundtrack will be instantly downloaded, 'City of Stars' and 'Mia & Sebastian's Theme' were the highlights. The production, costume and sound design were all perfect. The dimming of the lights to focus on the characters felt refreshingly revelatory. Urghhh I think I'm in love. This is why I adore the medium of film. To capture the magic of a whirlwind romance in a joyous perspective. It is undoubtedly rare to watch a film in this calibre. I never thought I would say this but...La La Land gets the perfect rating. Damian Chazelle...two for two, congratulations! Keep it up.",La La Land,3783958
88,MLDinTN,how disappointing,2/10,21 September 2017,"This movie is boring and I don't understand how it could have won awards and gotten the praise it received. The songs are nothing great. It's not funny. All it is a story of how a struggling actress and musician finally get success after they break up. What's good about that? The ending doesn't make much sense. I guess it shows how Mia's is thinking her life would have been different if they didn't break up.FINAL VERDICT: Don't waste money on this.

90,mbhgkmsgg,Movie magic,10/10,9 November 2020,"When I watched and reviewed this film for the first time about three years ago, I spent most of the review talking about movie magic. I did it because I believed this movie to be one of the finest examples of that. Now three years later, that belief has only grown stronger.For some reason, I had almost completely forgotten how happy La La Land made me. Otherwise, I wouldn't have waited three years to watch it again. Indeed now that I had decided to see it once more, I was incredibly excited to watch it. Probably the most excited I have ever been to watch a movie at home. But I was also scared. You see, this is one of the movies that I hold closest to my heart, and quite frankly, I was scared that I wouldn't like it as much as I did on the first time. What if it didn't feel special anymore? So in my state of excitement and fright, I started the movie and as soon as the first scene started I completely forgot about that fright and just started smiling. That's why I love this movie so much. That's why it's one of my all-time favourites. Because it just makes me so damn happy.La La Land is either my favourite or second favourite movie of all time (I need to rewatch Whiplash to confirm which one it is). One of the reasons why I love this movie so terribly much is because it's one of the only movies that I have seen that can just make me forget about everything else for over two hours. I love the music and the dancing. I love the way this film is shot and its gorgeous lighting. And above all else, I love the story and how it makes me feel. Perhaps it is that unexplainable movie magic that makes this movie as good as it is.I really need to make sure that I watch this film more often in the future. To me, La La Land really is just a festival of joy. It's filled with feeling and wonder, and it takes me to some other, much happier place.
To end with my favourite quote from the movie.

92,jas-46858,Love or Hate musicals: Watch this film!,10/10,11 February 2018,"As you may be able to tell by the other reviews on this website, everyone is split on whether this is a good film, or a bad film. Think of it as this, the film is described as a Comedy, Musical and Drama.This film is funny when it needs to be. I wouldn't call it an out and out comedy like a Kevin Hart or Will Ferrell film. Nor would I compare it to a Wes Anderson film where it's a witty black comedy. It's just funny when it needs to be.This film is a brilliant drama. The film begins and you may think ""Oh well this is generic"" but if you stay to the very end of this film you will find that Damien Chazelle has not only proved himself as a very good writer, but is a world class director. No other director can develop characters and make you care for them like Damien.This film is also a musical, surprise surprise. I don't know what people were expecting coming into a modern musical, but the Director chose Jazz. Not everyone likes Jazz, but personally I thoroughly enjoyed the music in this film, and this comes from someone who doesn't like musicals OR JAZZ.I won't ridicule you for not liking this film, but no matter what you think about Musicals, or Dramas, or the film itself. You MUST watch your film.",La La Land,3783958
93,Ramascreen,Remarkable! One of the best experiences I've had in theaters this year,10/10,26 November 2016,"""La La Land"" has the exuberance of ""West Side Story,"" the willpower of ""Dreamgirls"" and the pizazz of ""Grease""s romance. Writer/director Damien Chazelle who rocked our world with ""Whiplash"" a couple of years ago, has done it again. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are a movie match made in musical heaven. I seriously cannot find a single false note with ""La La Land.""The story is about Mia (Emma Stone) who is an aspiring actress, struggling from one audition to the next, her daytime job is working at a coffee shop in a studio lot where she can be near her dream. Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) is a dedicated jazz musician struggling to make ends meet, dreaming of someday running his own jazz club. Mia and Sebastian meet and fall for each other, but they live in a city known for crushing hopes and breaking hearts. Together they continue to explore the joy and pain of pursuing their dreams.Damien Chazelle has found a way to reignite our love for Los Angeles the way ""Rebel Without a Cause"" did decades ago, in fact, much of ""La La Land"" is more or less of an homage to that James Dean classic. The colors, the look, the design, the tone, even though it's set in present day, the characters could've easily been transported from a golden age era. What an ambitious production, Chazelle's crew even literally reserved a whole freeway just for their opening scene and trust me when I say that that scene must've been worth the traffic because it's absolutely spectacular. The songs, the music, the choreography are flawless, they're on point, they're upbeat, they take you up to cloud nine. And when the rejections roll in and the characters hit rock bottom and Ryan Gosling melodiously sings his ""City Of Stars"" song, it's so tender, it becomes your only desired remedy.Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone had worked together before on ""Gangster Squad"" so you can sense that these two actors feel very comfortable in each other's company. The level of trust between them is evident. It must be like returning to a familiar place. One sequence stands out where they dance at the Griffith Park and they're so in sync, you start to wonder how many takes did it take for them to get that down pat. What's even more impressive is their abilities to play instruments and sing, even if you don't like musical, the minute you watch ""La La Land,"" you'll stand up and cheer because the things that Gosling and Stone do will blow your mind. ""La La Land"" is original, it's remarkable, it's one of the best experiences I've had in theaters this year. With this film, Chazelle has established himself as one of the greatest storytellers of our time. And the themes hit home. Pursuing your dreams does come with a cost, because it all comes down to whether or not you're willing to give it all you've got. It's so much easier to just play it safe and do regular 9 to 5 job like everybody else. Pursuing your dreams is risky, self-doubt gets to haunt you every step of the way, and failure lurks around the corner. But what's wonderful about ""La La Land"" is that it points out the importance of having someone that believes IN you, just like the way Mia and Sebastian believe in each other, the world be damned.-- Rama's Screen --",La La Land,3783958
94,Quinoa1984,La La Land,10/10,18 December 2016,"I wonder if I had just stumbled upon this movie, being Damien Chazelle's third as director, not knowing anything or knowing little about it, if I would've liked/loved/fallen head over heels for it more than I did. Because of the state of the independent film scene (and this is one of those mid-way movies like Pulp Fiction, where it has its toes in indie and mainstream Hollywood, the latter if nothing else via its stars and setting), movies like La La Land come backed with the kind of hype that usually would be reserved for, say, a Star Wars movie. It also has to do too with the director's previous, Whiplash, being a ride that gives Emotional Roller-coaster its clichéd status, since it was the announcement of a director (from my generation/exact age group) swinging for the fences. And La La Land, with its major reviews and festival runs, seemed like another one. And it is, ultimately, a great movie. Could it have been better? Hmm.Sometimes, furthermore, coming right off from seeing as movie and dumping thoughts and feelings out like a raccoon spilling a garbage can at night and scattering the contents is not always ""correct"" as one might say. It may take another viewing, or a few days, to get more of what I felt about it. But I can say that this is a movie about musicals and musical about movies, and usually these cross and twist like it's a dance out in outer space. Chazelle is also bringing a story that is so familiar - artists in music and performance, close enough as the same thing, who meet, have a little push-and-pull at first (they first meet by the usual serendipity of LA traffic jam) - that it could be criticized as a rehash. Hell, we just had a movie come out a month ago/around this same time, Nocturnal Animals, that, if you look closely, isn't too far off (though the endings are VERY different, which I'll get to what is so gobsmackingly JOYFUL about this movie).Gosling and Stone first were paired five years ago in Crazy Stupid Love, and I'm sure Chazelle knew this and bet on it being stronger this time around. Though as a nitpick (and it should be mentioned) Gosling can't sing anything exceptional, Stone can and they know how to dance and bond and kiss and bring the romance out in full force. La La Land would be a beautiful exercise in technicalities, of pulling off all of the care-free MOVIE ideas that Chazelle has (seriously, he's about as geeky in his homage as Tarantino - notice the Ingrid Bergman wall- sized poster in Mia's place and other parts, or the whole use of the WB lot), but what makes it a triumph is that the actors work well together and separately. More than well, they find the truth in the clichés that come with artists-trying-to-make-it and sell it as well as Chazelle's script can get them to.Which, perhaps, is the one thing that keeps me from saying 'OMG THIS IS THE GREATEST MOVIE I've EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE' (which, again, hype) - it takes you so immediately into musical terrain with its opening number in LA traffic that it's jarring to then go back into the 'real' world, more or less. Songs of course happen, but it's a balancing act, and all the while Chazelle's story points for these two is so familiar as far as the 'What Happens When You Follow Your Dreams in Artistic/Corporate America' thing that it goes into what could almost be dangerous terrain - not embracing and finding a truth in cliché, but just being conventional (i.e. how Gosling becomes a piano player in a group John Legend's got, and this takes him away from his actual 'dream' of a jazz club, and then Stone's Mia's dream of being an actress, etc etc so forth and so on).... And then the final 15 minutes or so happens, where we flash ahead five years to what's happened with these two people who, at one point, went to the same planetarium as in Rebel Without a Cause and dance and go into the stratosphere of the galaxy (I'm reminded of the French New Wave, a lot, by the way, in how much Chazelle embraces post-modern self-consciousness; if Breathless was his Whiplash, is this his, uh, A Woman is a Woman?) And the two of them have changed, more or less, and Gosling plays a song that transports into the 'what if' and it's... I don't have words for it. It's what the movies are about. It's a magical, wonderful 15 minutes that reminded me why I can stand being around people whispering (like I don't hear you, old bastards) and munching popcorn and can be transported into a completely made-up, empathetic landscape.My first instinct is to go for the typical critical bulls*** of saying 'this is ""better"" than this' (that is Whiplash vs La La Land), but it doesn't matter. That last fifteen minutes, and many other scenes and Stone's performance and the dancing and the whole color palette and the cinematography (oh man, I don't care if you're verging from homage into rip-off of PT Anderson, it's so delicious for my eyes to look at), confirms that Chazelle is the real deal, a filmmaker with something to say about the human experience, about what it means to chase that unfortunate dragon known as the ""dream"" of artists and musicians and actors and so on, and at the same time can bring it forward with... soul. It takes a little time, but my instinct is to call this a soulful Hollywood movie first, beautiful homage second.",La La Land,3783958
