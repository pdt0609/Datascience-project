0,SnoopyStyle,great work from Jonah Hill,8/10,25 March 2017,"It's 2005 Miami. David Packouz (Miles Teller) is struggling as a masseuse. He reconnects with childhood friend Efraim Diveroli (Jonah Hill). Efraim has been buying guns from police auctions and reselling them online. There is a new government clearing house website for military contracts and he's looking to pick up some of the crumbs. David joins him after getting girlfriend Iz (Ana de Armas) pregnant. With dry cleaner Ralph Slutsky (Kevin Pollak) providing the capital, they start getting some contracts. Eventually, they meet unsavory arms dealer Henry Girard (Bradley Cooper) and get a massive Afghan deal.This is unlike Todd Phillips' more famed comedic movies. It's not big laughs but it is a lighter look at a darker world. Jonah Hill gets chubbier to fit this character perfectly. He is a douche but he is not a threatening douche. He has just enough crazy but not uncontrolled. His chemistry with Teller is terrific. This is a compelling story told in a compelling and engaging way. It's great all around and an overlooked gem.",War Dogs,2005151
1,CANpatbuck3664,Interesting Story About 2 Con Artists Selling Weapons to the U.S. Government,8/10,3 September 2016,"I was pretty stoked to see War Dogs. Jonah Hill has been on a roll lately and having an unconventional director like Todd Phillips telling a story about 2 guys lucking into a giant contract to arm the U.S. government was intriguing. I'm also a big fan of Lord of War, I think it's really underrated (one of Nicolas Cage's best movies) and I was excited to see a similar story. After having seen War Dogs, don't expect something mind-blowing but it does have an interesting story to tell.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* David Packouz (Miles Teller) is working as a massage therapist in Miami. He's working to try and start a family with his girlfriend Iz (Ana de Armas) but he hasn't really found any purpose in his life. He gets stoned and tries to get through his day and his clients sexually harassing him. He also makes a stop as he's trying to sell bed sheets on the side and its not going well. The next day he has to go to a funeral for a friend and he runs into his best friend from middle school Efraim Deveroli (Jonah Hill). The two were trouble makers in their younger years and its implied that their parents separated them against their will. Efraim is happy to see David and they catch up a little bit. Efraim laughs at what David is doing and tells him he had a falling out with his last business partner (his uncle) and he moved back to Miami to set up shop for himself. He deals in small time contracts supplying arms to the U.S. government. David is impressed but is against the war. They go to score weed and when they get ripped off Efraim pulls out an assault rifle from the trunk of his car. It certainly causes the dealers to scatter and he invites David to his office to explain his job to him a little better the next day.The plot of this movie has a really interesting hook. AEY (the company David and Efraim eventually form) finding contracts to fill that major suppliers ignore and making bank off of them is fun to watch. Efraim and David aren't completely incompetent but they're dishonest and they don't understand their place in their industry. How they could appear legitimate enough to be so seriously involved with Uncle Sam is baffling. It's a so strange it's true story and they include some interesting bits about how the U.S. government supplied their army in the Iraq war. War Dogs doesn't have too many twists and turns that you don't see coming but you'll find yourself wanting to know where David and Efraim will go next. It's not as informative as The Big Short for example but you do pick up some good nuggets along with following a pretty engaging story.I mentioned that Todd Phillips was a strange choice considering how serious the material is. The trailers for War Dogs are misleading, the movie is more of a drama than a comedy but I enjoyed it all the same. It did have the sense of humour that Todd's movies tend to have (on the dark side and sometimes vulgar). The movie was also a lot more stylish than I expected it to be. It's well filmed and there was more effort put into creating an attractive movie as opposed to just relying on the material. The soundtrack was also good but it was a little on the nose and they really blared it at points. It didn't make me mad but the lack of subtlety with it was a little annoying.Jonah Hill continues his recent run of excellent work. It's not my favourite performance of his but he brings life to this movie and although his character is a scumbag, he's the proficient one and how he's able to navigate through his job is one of the big reasons War Dogs works. Miles Teller is also good, he's playing the more normal of the two characters and he's less in your face. Bradley Cooper really does excellent work in the short amount of screen time he gets. He's menacing and I was happy to watch him play a different part in this movie. His character was more in the background and I liked that, any other movie would have made him an over-the-top villain. He was an appropriately ruthless businessman and it seemed more real. It was nice to see Kevin Pollak again and I also liked Ana de Armas in her role, she's definitely a supporting part and while she's not given a whole lot of backstory, she's fine in her part.Another small thing I liked with War Dogs is that the ending didn't go the typical route. This is a rise and fall story and it looks like you're going to get that same old ending. War Dogs sidesteps that and instead of scolding David for doing what he did, they go for something more open-ended. The moral of the story is that what they did was wrong but instead of beating you over the head with it, they pose the question that will David stick to his new found moral code when presented with temptation? It was different and it upped the grade of the movie for me.I thought War Dogs was an interesting movie that did a good job presenting the story of these 2 guys in a different way. It follows a familiar arc and you can guess where the story is going to go but the acting and the new angle it presents on arms dealers help compensate. I still prefer Lord of War but this was a solid movie and a good way to close out the summer movie season.",War Dogs,2005151
2,lee_eisenberg,"war is a business, and we're the commodity",6/10,30 November 2016,"I don't know enough about the original story to determine the accuracy of Todd Phillips's ""War Dogs"", but it's an enjoyable movie. The tricks pulled by David Packouz and Efraim Diveroli just go to show that the people in the business of weapons have no principles (even violating arms embargoes). They're out to make money by any means necessary. To be certain, the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq proved quite profitable for weapons manufacturers. The mistake that Packouz and Diveroli made was getting caught.It's not a masterpiece, but it does a respectable job showing the degrees to which these types go to enrich themselves. A very slimy world indeed.

3,phd_travel,Eye opening - very interesting and funny look at arms dealing,9/10,1 September 2016,"The story is eye opening, relevant and very clearly told with a humorous tone through the serious subject matter. This is based on a true story with some fictionalized elements to make it entertaining. A massage therapist links up with a childhood friend who is a small time arms dealer. Very interesting to get a look at the legal but morally questionable world of arms dealing. I thought this would be a juvenile buddy movie with a bit of war thrown in but it isn't.Jonah Hill has some funny lines and he does a great job with the over the top character but he can be subtly sinister when he needs to be. Miles Teller plays his character sympathetically and I liked him here. Quite different from the rather annoying characters he usually plays. Bradley Cooper who produced the movie and has a small but pivotal role and he is effective as an arms dealer.Quite a transporting experience as the action takes you from Miami to Jordan and Iraq with some funny situations there and Albania.Watch this movie. It deserves to do better than it has so far.",War Dogs,2005151
4,SpoilerAlertReviews,Is that even legal??,8/10,1 September 2016,"Hangover/Due Date director Todd Philipps makes a film base on the true story of young, entrepreneur gun-runners David Parkouz and Efraim Diveroli who managed to secure a ridiculous contract to supply arms to the afghan army via the pentagon. Miles Teller plays the struggling and ambitious David who bumps into his childhood buddy Efraim played by Jonah Hill who is somewhat of the opposite, a loose cannon, fearless and a little trigger-happy. Now, Efraim has found himself a little niche in the market, the market of arms dealing and strikes up small deals with the US military. David needs a job to support his expecting girlfriend, the stunning Ana de Armas who looks a little like Penelope Cruz only more beautiful and has one of those exotic accents. Efraim sees an opportunity for David and the two team up to what leads to the deal of the century for all parties involved. Now, the film has plenty of other film references most notably Scarface, even one of the promotional posters is a respectful nod to the DePalma/Pacino's film. But it's actually Lord of War Efraim is a huge fan of in real-life and it's probably more like Lord of War than Scarface, yet it has tinge of Pain & Gain, another crazy true story movie. Maybe it's Miami? But it has that vibrant and funny yet serious storytelling style that makes the film almost unbelievable and shocking. The rest of the cast does include Bradley Cooper who also produced the film, playing the harden, borderline war-criminal, pretty much the Branson of the arms market and someone you don't really want to be messing with. There's Kevin Pollack playing the bankroll and an awesome cameo of venture capitalist playboy millionaire Dan Bilzerian. It's accompanied by a great soundtrack with tracks from 50cent, Beastie Boys, Iggy Pop, UB40 and CCR but the awesome score threw me completely thinking it was Harry Gregson-Williams or Steve Jablonski, no, it was Cliff Martinez with those ambient sounds. The film is highly entertaining, funny in parts but this is not a comedy; its perfectly paced with some great scenes like the duo gun-running across the triangle of death and some nice camera work. However it's not to epic portions, not that it should put anyone off watching this, it's still a very watchable and enjoyable film and I don't think they could have done it any better. Running Time: 8 The Cast: 8 Performance: 8 Direction: 8 Story: 8 Script: 8 Creativity: 8 Soundtrack: 9 Job Description: 8 The Extra Bonus Points: 5 for a slick story, good editing and a great score/soundtrack to boot. 78% 8/10",War Dogs,2005151
5,tomgillespie2002,Entertaining true-life tale that doesn't have the nerve to go all the way,6/10,3 December 2016,"There were many shocking and quite unbelievable stories to emerge from the U.S. during the Bush/Cheney administration, but none were quite as fantastical as the overwhelming position 20-something minor-league arms dealers Efraim Diveroli and David Packouz found themselves in. Their tale is utterly preposterous, but entirely true, although events naturally have been dramatised for the film. Like something straight out of a culture-clash comedy from the 1980s, Diveroli and Packouz landed a $298 million Pentagon contract involving over a hundred million rounds of ammunition. The mishandling of the deal and the pair's subsequent falling out was covered in a Rolling Stone article by Guy Lawson, and later in a book by Lawson entitled Arms and the Dudes.David Packouz (Miles Teller) is a pot-smoking massage therapist working in Miami, Florida, dividing his spare time between his girlfriend Iz (Ana de Armas) and trying, somewhat unsuccessfully, to flog the high-quality Egyptian bed-sheets that he has invested in to retirement homes. At a funeral, he encounters his old best friend Efraim (Jonah Hill), who has made a success in Los Angeles trading in arms on eBay. They rekindle their friendship, despite Efraim proving himself to be a unpredictable loose-cannon, and David eventually joins his chum at his new business venture AEY. With the war raging in Iraq, the government has set up a website offering contracts for weapons and military equipment. David's job is to pick up the crumbs; those small orders the big companies ignore.There are, as Efraim informs David, a hell of a lot of crumbs, and the two are soon making their fortunes while Efraim indulges in everything from prostitutes to copious amounts of cocaine. The two grew up loving Brian De Palma's Scarface (1983), and imagery from the film adorns AEY's office walls. The same unquenchable greed that possessed Al Pacino's character seems to drive Efraim also, and it isn't long before you can see the inevitable downfall on the horizon. Director Todd Phillips, on the back of those terrible The Hangover sequels, seems to be intent on making a semi-serious film, and wisely takes inspiration from some of America's great dark-side- of-the-American-dream cinematic works, such as De Palma's aforementioned drug-lord saga and Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas (1990). But, unlike Adam McKay's The Big Short from last year, Phillips doesn't have the nerve to go all the way.Where McKay exquisitely balanced comedy, drama and satire to dazzling effect, Phillips seems too intent on focusing on the goofball antics of its hapless anti-heroes to deliver any real bite. This is a story that highlights many things from the government's irresponsible approach to warfare, the dangerous practice of allowing just anybody to legally deal in arms, and the devastating effects of blind ambition, but these themes are only touched upon. Packouz is essentially our lead character, but he feels like little more than an exposition tool, with de Armas getting the thankless role of the boring partner who must warn her hubby whenever his actions lead him into the dark side. Thankfully, Jonah Hill is a tour de force, cranking his loathsome character up to 11 without ever feeling unbelievable, proving once again what a versatile actor he is becoming. If you're looking for an intelligent satire of a fascinating recent event, then you probably won't find it here, but as a piece of entertainment, it certainly delivers.",War Dogs,2005151
6,subxerogravity,"Seems like an odd pairing of Miles Teller and Jonah Hill in a war pic, but real great pic.",7/10,19 August 2016,"Similar tone to Whiskey Tango Foxtrot, It was a lot more serious than what I expected after seeing the trailer. It's not the first time I've seen either Miles Teller or Jonah Hill in something more dramatic, I just may have assumed their first real outing together in a movie would be more of a straight up comedy.Semi based on a true story of two young guys from Miami who became arms dealers, Miles Teller narrates the story of how David Packouz teamed up with this best friend from the tenth grade, Efraim Diveroli and got in too over his head.I was expecting more comedy from the two rather than just two young stars being entertaining. The movie is not disappointing with the team of Teller and Hill. If you are a fan of either one of these guys you are going to love the film.Jonah Hill gives a performance that seem to be something between what he did in 21 Jump Street and the Wolf of Wall Street. The part just fits him so well as he plays a con man who tries to be everyone to everything on the outside but is really evil in the inside, and no matter how much you discover about his evil, Hill still makes the character likable.But the likability is more met for Miles Teller, who Hill is supporting with greatness. Teller plays the sympathetic role of a man whose lost in his life at a time when his girl is about to have a baby, and he needs the money.Director, Todd Phillips weaves a story about how people have profited from the war, and done bad things to profit from a bad war. It's almost like the Big Short, with it's explanation about how the arms game really works, but I always felt that the actual story was getting overshadow by the personalities of the two stars worthy of watching.But overall, It is a very funny film and very entertaining, thanks to the Hill, Teller combohttp://cinemagardens.com",War Dogs,2005151
7,skullhead739,"Exciting, funny, and illegal",8/10,21 July 2020,"The movie starts off narrated, interesting and very cohesive. They do a great job of introducing characters and foreshadowing what is later to come. The characters are very well developed and their relationship especially at the start is funny and light hearted. The acting is great if you like films like ""superbad"" and ""neighbour's"".The plot itself is based off a true story and is really interesting from start to finish. The action is great with slight comedy here and there. It has very wolf of wall street vibes and is a thrill ride.When Bradley Cooper gets involved there is a lot of mystery and suspense. You really don't know whats gonna happen and your interest becomes even greater. The contract part was extremely predictable. The ending was very weird, without spoiling it, someone goes to jail for what seems a really short amount of time considering the crime. Then someone gets given money which is somewhat satisfying. But you really don't get a feeling of revenge or justice.Summary:
Overall I was really surprised at how good this was. Its not just your average comedy. It has great characters, acting, story, and is a blast to watch. Highly recommended.",War Dogs,2005151
8,bodeanura,"It's good. Better than ""fine"" but not ""great"".",8/10,21 August 2016,"Right off the bat the best part of this movie is the acting: Teller and Hill have great chemistry on screen. Jonah does a particularly good job at playing the ""guy you love to hate"". I can't attest to the faithfulness of their portrayal of the real life people since I don't know anything about them. The rest of the cast does a great job as well.The marketing for this movie was, unfortunately, deceitful: the trailer made it out to be this upbeat, funny, over the top comedy - which it's not. In reality the movie has a much slower pace, not a lot of situational humor and is certainly not filled with hilarious quips (the bulk of which are in the trailer). This is not to say that the movie was bad or not at all funny, it just wasn't what I expected (and I am sure I'm not alone).My final critique will go unnoticed for the majority of viewers but I found it personally offensive so I have to report it: some of the movie takes place in Albania, only the set for Albania is actually Romania. Which is fine, I understand that they probably did this for practical reasons and as a Romanian movie goer I just have to accept it (we all recognized it immediately though). However, at some point in the movie an ""Albanian"" woman says something, only she says it in Romanian. This may not seem like much but it totally took me out of the movie and ruined the experience for me. I find it completely unacceptable that they could not hire an Albanian to say those few lines. The two languages might seem interchangeable to the rest of the world, I am sure, but that was very much NOT the case for me and everyone else in the theater.I am a paying movie goer as well and I expect to be just as entertained as everyone else. This is, of course, not the first time that I've seen this in a film. But when a producer does something like this it shows me that they don't respect their movie, so they can't expect me to.My rating, however, is not based on this final bit of criticism. I gave it a 7/10 for slow pacing and lack of humor, which is the opposite of what I expected.I'd still recommend it, just don't expect to be blown away.After watching it for a second time I decided to change my original rating from 7/10 to 8/10, mainly because the acting is just great and I respect the fact that the movie made me think about it and made me want to see it again.",War Dogs,2005151
9,monismilan06,Wolf of wall street meets Lord Of war,8/10,27 August 2016,"If you like wolf of wall street, I believe you are gonna like this movie too, even though it not have all the funny moments. The plot is similar a nice guy (Teller) find a way to make money doing stuff located on the line of legal and illegal. The music was well chosen for every scene, acting (specially from Hill and Cooper) was outstanding. On the contrary if you though that Wolf.. didn't show enough all the people who suffer from their actions, and that the movie glorifies bad actions and the eternal search for money, you will not like this movie. It all depends in the end of your personal standards of what can be made fun of, and what subjects are too controversial (in this case, war, guns and arms dealers) to have a good time with.

10,ronanmeire,Based on real story? I wish my life was so daringly exciting!,9/10,3 September 2016,"The movie is classified as a crime/ drama film but one knows it will have a comical aspect when Jonah Hill is involved. He is the anti-villain: at any opportunity, he (Efraim) endeavours to illude the audience into believing he is the virtuous character. Nevertheless, Miles Teller (David) plays a very strong anti-hero. He is innocent and begins to get unduly caught in the crossfire of an international arms dealing stratagem, albeit one could argue he does so himself and the repercussions are as a direct result of his childish behaviour. On the whole, this movie - like many other contemporary crime films - would lose a star or two in its rating had it not contained such wondrous actors. Hill and Teller are the perfect tag-team, but their split by the end of the movie reminds me of a phrase I coined a long time ago: ""He (Efraim) is a time bomb: tick, tick, ticking. And I (David) have no intention of being around for the boom.""",War Dogs,2005151
11,851222,Superb movie,10/10,1 December 2016,"Greetings from Lithuania.""War Dogs"" (2016) is highly involving, superbly made movie based on a very true story. I do think this is Todd Phillips best yet, even better then great ""The Hangover"" which i loved. Script was very involving from the get go. Acting was superb by everyone, especially of course by two lead but especially by Jonah Hill. Directing was very solid as well as some superbly old songs that played right when they needed to be played.Overall, ""War Dogs"" is a superb movie on all amounts. It is highly involving, very strongly acted, superbly written and very solidly directed true story. You can't ask for more.

12,joshuaprentice,"Solid film, but lacks originality",8/10,29 August 2016,"This film is definitely worth the watch. Jonah Hill and Myles Teller both shine superbly in this film, and Bradley Cooper has some genuine mystique about him during his performance. However, this is the second film I have seen this year, that seems to try and recapture the brilliance of Martin Scorcese's 'Wolf of wall street'. What I mean by that is both this film and 'The Big Short' take a complex real life event, that not a whole lot of people fully understood, and made a film that took time to make light of the scenarios, and tried to explain them to the audience in a common way. This film does it well, and beats 'The Big Short' as it was definitely the easier film to follow. However, it does use a lot of comedy aspects from 'Wold of Wall Street'. You compare Jonah Hill's character Efraim to Donnie his character from TWOWS, they are exactly the same for the first half of this movie. Also, this movie makes light of a very serious real life scenario, and felt to safe considering the context. It's to light hearted and the only real drama or tension comes from the two friends. On it's own this film is highly re-watchable, and that's down to the lightheartedness, but take a second to stop and think about the real life story, it feels to lighthearted. With Wall Street it worked because all the characters were terrible people, so it was funny to see them mess up. Here, Myles Teller plays a very likable character, and with some of the sinister characters, this film needed to feel more threatening. However, credit is where credits due, the film did a great job of breaking down how arms dealing works, the same way TWOWS did for stock brokering. and the tone just felt fun, and made it easy to watch. To use wrestling terms, the heel turn seemed a little off, and needed more build, and also just the amount of similarities to TWOWS, from the way they close it out, to Jonah Hill's performance, just the narration by Teller, these films are almost parallel, so that holds this film back from being truly great. But, the funny thing is, this film works. Hill's performance as both a comedic and dramatic actor is fantastic, he balances the two so well. If you haven't seen TWOWS, your going to love this move a hell of a lot, while the film lacks the risks to make it an instant classic, and is to lighthearted on the seriousness of this real life industry, its still fun and re-watchable, and the script and how this film flows just makes it enjoyable viewing. I know I have talked long about the lack of originality, but honestly besides that and the lack of tone, or pushing the boundaries, the film does its job well. Hill and Teller have great chemistry, and I could go back and watch this over and over again. The effort to make people aware of this event can not be faulted, and they made arms dealing and the art of war a lot easier to understand that Big Short did for the financial crisis in 08. The sinister tone to end it, was definitely a tonal shift, but I won't spoil it for you here. I'm just going to say, you will have fun, if you're a fan of TWOWS or similar films, or you really enjoy Jonah Hill or Myles Teller, they deliver. I'm giving it a 4/5 stars. If it pushed the boundaries more, and had more originality I would have given it a 4.5 which I only reserve for great movies. As it is though, it's a re-watchable, fun, well acted, educational film. And you won't even know you're being educated.",War Dogs,2005151

17,UniqueParticle,Very enjoyable story and Jonah Hills laugh makes worth watching even better!,10/10,1 November 2020,"Such a smooth highly entertaining story about gun runners/business. I originally saw in the theater that was a blast plus wasn't reviewing then. The voice over by Miles Teller is so great, the amount f bombs Jonah Hill uses are glorious, soundtrack is incredible, writing is superb, cinematography is beautiful and the bit of comedy is delightful! War Dogs should've at least won an award that year, definitely deserves it!

19,RosanaBotafogo,Great movie...,8/10,6 July 2021,"It seems to be an unauthorized biography, based on the protagonist's book, I don't like it, they generate misrepresentations and exaggerations, like the dangers I had run, because most of the contacts were by PC, but the film is great, it illustrates the ""American Dream"" well , in a fun, criminal and creative way, and brings out all American rot... Italian mocks the ""TP19"" gun, saying it's ""Brazilian and it sucks"" (reference to Taurus PT92 cheaper copy)... Great movie...

20,brankovranjkovic,War dogs - comedy or drama?,10/10,5 September 2016,"Stars Jonah Hill and Miles Teller, supported by Bradley Cooper in a minor but important roleThis is a fact based melodrama of two old school friends who meet again at a funeral and become arms dealers. The US government is awarding military contracts and the 'chums' are there to 'pick up the crumbs' of which there are manyThe film is basically split into 3 parts 1)Character building, we discover their individual motivations. 2) The rise of their arms dealing empire. 3)Greed gets the better of Jonah's character and the empire falls Bradley Cooper is the guy able to help fill the orders with his dubious connections, he explains his inclusion on a terrorism watch list prevents his own dealings. He is always portrayed as the bad guy until the end scene This movie is much better than I expected, Jonah's laugh is distinctive and very contagious. There is some strong language but the certificate 15 is probably awarded due to the very frequent drug use. I would definitely recommend this film",War Dogs,2005151
21,wisdomwasp,"Get rich quick, bit of wish fulfilment with a good message in the end",10/10,28 March 2022,"This is a great and underrated movie. It is paced perfectly, with great humour mixed with moments of seriousness. Jonah Hill is fantastically hilarious as Efraim the ambitious, loose and cut throat arms dealer and Miles Teller is also flawless as the protagonist of the film, his old best friend David who gets drawn in to fast war money.These kind of films appeal to me, the ones that present a world of underdogs making a success of themselves either bending or breaking the rules, but also showing the morality of how ultimately if you live that way one day you will slip, and one day it will all come crashing down.The movie has a couple of absolute great moments, without spoiling too much the weed dealers and chase scene. The interplay between the two best friends is also played well. All other characters play support bits in and out at best, Ana de Armas can act, but I couldn't tell if she was acting well in this movie because of the thick accent but honestly she was not hired for her acting ability in this film. Jonah Hill definitely steals the show - he can play one character very well and he does it too perfection here.An enjoyable ride, not to everyone's taste but I like it a lot.",War Dogs,2005151
22,kosmasp,Dogs of War,8/10,14 June 2017,"Lord of War isn't that bad a comparison and throwing a bit of Wolf of Wall Street (with a tighter two men approach to it), you would say that comparison nails it. This is based on something that really happened and just the way it is portrayed is kind of mesmerizing. You wouldn't think some of those things would be possible. Would actually apply to the real world ... but apparently they do.Being the Devil's Advocate is one thing, getting greedy another. But you could almost argue it's human nature. And you wouldn't be too far off. Although obviously some do have a moral compass even when it doesn't always work, it may set off at some point and remind them of something they want and something they are or aren't. You may be shocked at how easy some things where back then, but that's life ... and it's really all about the ... Benjamins

23,sfx96,Formulaic,6/10,3 September 2016,"War DogsOne could sum up this movie in a single word, ""formulaic.""If you've ever watched any of the movies about West Coast drug-dealing of the 80s (Blow), or any movie with Benicio Del Toro in it (Snatch, Traffic), you will quickly recognize one or more of the stylistic techniques stamped all over this movie:Off-camera narration by one of the protagonists talking about how smart or stupid they were at this point in the adventure.Wackiness in the face of danger. Celebration of the stoner mentality.Overhead shots using helicopters or drones.Overuse of circular camera dolly around two subjects quibbling to suggest ""tension.""Cool music.Oddity------Choice of music. The setting for the movie is the early 2000s, and these guys are in their 20s, yet the music is a collection golden oldies from 60s. Is that the music the producers like? Is it aimed at the suspected target audience?Nitpicks-------The lead character says ""Bro"" more times than any character in any movie in history. Guess that's a refreshing change from ""dude."" LOL.Aside from all that, I still liked the movie, just thought is was hackneyed and formulaic.",War Dogs,2005151
24,classicsoncall,"""This is about being pro-money!""",7/10,27 February 2021,"I watched the movie and still can't believe it's based on a true story! How these two guys with no background or expertise managed to become big time, international arms dealers is beyond comprehension. Now I've seen Jonah Hill in a number of vehicles but never this huge, that was rather shocking. This was my first look at Miles Teller, he had a nice All-American look, but both guys looked so young to pull off what they were doing that it defied belief. The biggest disconnect occurred late in the film when it was stated that it would take fifty men eight weeks to repack a hundred million rounds of Chinese ammunition to sell back to the United States government. But then Efraim (Hill) didn't pay the box guy the paltry hundred grand that he asked for! That right there demonstrated what a creep Efraim was, when he stood to rake in millions on the contract. Besides the fact he was going to screw his partner. And then he only got a four year prison sentence while Dave Packouz got merely a seven month house arrest! Just goes to show, if you want to screw the government and pretty much get away with it, do it in as big a way as possible.",War Dogs,2005151
25,MatthewMichaelHoffman,Only 7 months of house arrest?,7/10,26 August 2022,"SCORE: 6.8/10100% gave me Wolf of Wall Street vibes. All I can really say about this movie was that it was enjoyable and very interesting on the surface level. I don't know much about Arms Dealing, but seeing both Miles Teller and Jonah Hill grabbed my attention. In my opinion, this film is heavily carried by the fact that it is based on a true story. And, of course, how could I forget about the lovely Ana de Armas. Also, I can't be the only one perplexed by how Packouz only ended up receiving 7 months of house arrest. That's insane. Lastly, I couldn't help but chuckle every time I heard Jonah Hill laugh.",War Dogs,2005151
26,jboothmillard,War Dogs,8/10,2 September 2016,"I saw the trailer for this film just days before it was released, I liked the three big stars in it, and it looked like it could be good fun, I was also intrigued by the high praise by critics, directed by Todd Phillips (Road Trip, Due Date, The Hangover Trilogy). Basically in 2005 David Packouz (Whiplash's Miles Teller) spent his life savings on high-quality Egyptian cotton sheets, planning to sell them to Miami retirement homes, to make income for him and his girlfriend Iz (Ana de Armas), but it fails. At a funeral he runs into his high school best friend Efraim Diveroli (Jonah Hill), who used to sell guns for his uncle, he has now formed his own company, AEY (which doesn't stand for anything), which fills orders for arms placed by the US government due to the ongoing War in Iraq. David and both oppose the war, but he accepts a job from Efraim, following Iz telling him that she is pregnant, David lies to Iz that he is selling his cotton sheets to the military through Efraim's contacts. Efraim explains to David that all military equipment orders placed are posted on a public website, where anyone can place bids on filling the orders, their job is to find the small orders that larger contractors ignore and place bids on them, these smaller orders are still worth millions of dollars, they funded by small Ralph Slutzky (Kevin Pollak), who has also been lied to. Eventually David and Efraim land a contract that could put them on the map, for US Troops stationed in Baghdad, to provide several thousand Beretta pistols, there is a problem for the shipment to travel through Jordan to Iraq, Iz overhears a conversation between David and Efraim and discovers the truth of the business, she is upset. David and Efraim fly to Jordan to free up their cargo, or risk being blacklisted, with no permission to fly the cargo to Baghdad they are are provided with a driver to transport the guns to Iraq, as no permit is required for driving weapons across the border. They drive through the night, bribe border patrol with cartons of cigarettes, and get attacked by insurgents, but they eventually arrive at the military base, Captain Philip Santos (Patrick St. Esprit) is impressed with the lengths David and Efraim have gone to, and they are paid. Following this AEY continues to secure larger deals and make more money, they move into a bigger office and hire more employees, David welcomes a daughter named Ella, but Efraim is becoming increasingly unstable and untrustworthy, as they are given the chance to land their biggest deal yet, the US military want to arm Afghan for the military long-term, and place an order of $300 million, which includes 100 million rounds of AK-47 ammunition, this is called ""The Afghan Deal"". US arms dealer Henry Girard (Bradley Cooper) has access to the massive weapon storages created in Albania but never used, which includes well over 100 million rounds of AK-47 ammunition, he is on the watchlist and cannot deal directly with the US Government anymore, he makes the deal with AEY with Efraim's agreement, but David is uncomfortable working with a man on a terrorist watchlist. David and Efraim go to Albania to confirm the ammunition deal, but their bid on the contract ends up being fifty million dollars less than other bids placed, they win the bid, meanwhile Iz has grown frustrated with David's lies, so leaves to live with her mother. David realises that virtually all of the rounds have made illegally, but Efraim comes up with the idea to re- package the rounds in generic packaging, pretending that they are concerned about the weight of the shipments, it also saves them thousands to fly the cargo. David oversees the process of rounds packaged and shipped off, but Efraim plots to try to cut Henry out of the deal after making a discovery about the markup, David protests, Efraim destroys the contract between them, Henry retaliates by kidnapping David, held at gunpoint and beaten. David leaves Albania and returns to Miami, he wants out of AEY and demands a $4 million payoff from Efraim for the work he has done, Efraim refuses, David is forced to return to working as a massage therapist and convinces Iz to come back, telling the truth about everything. Efraim offers a break-off package of $200,000 to David, which David responds threatening to blackmail him with evidence of the falsified documentation the two created to look like a respectable company, shortly after this David and Efraim are arrested by the FBI, they were reported to the US Authorities by the men who had been hired to re-package the rounds, as they were never paid, Ralph Slutzky was arrested, wore a wire during a meeting between David and Efraim, giving the FBI evidence to arrest them. In the end Efraim was sentenced to four years in prison for charges related to The Afghan Deal, and David was put under house arrest for seven months, in exchange for co-operating with the investigation, David later meets with Henry, who apologises for the kidnap, he also thanks David for not mentioning his name in confession, Henry pulls out a suitcase full of money, part of his cut from The Afghan Deal, David's choice of taking the money or not left ambiguous. Also starring JB Blanc as Bashkim, Barry Livingston as Rock Island Bureaucrat, Homeland's Shaun Toub as Marlboro and Brenda Koo as Vanessa. Hill and Teller play their parts equally well as the unlikely 20-something arms dealers / gunrunners, Cooper gets his moments as well as one of their associates, it really is a stranger-than-fiction fact-based story, it gets the laughs from their stoner interactions and one- liners, and gets thrills from the arms trading and war zone stuff, an inventive and impressive biographical crime war comedy-drama. Very good!",War Dogs,2005151
27,jackspiceporter,Great movie,10/10,3 May 2022,"I struggle to find movies that are decent nowadays and put off watching this movie. Regret putting it off for so long because it was great. 10/10 is a super high rating for me but I feel it deserves it based on all the different emotions it gave me throughout the movie. War Dogs had it all, some really funny moments, sad moments and I even felt anxious at times which never happens for me during movies. The fact that it's loosely based off a real story makes it that much better. I will strongly recommend this movie, It was very refreshing.

30,lavatch,Shocking True Life Story,7/10,28 December 2016,"Based on the Guy Lawson Rolling Stone article ""Arms and the Dudes,"" the film ""War Dogs"" tells the story of two young hustlers in Florida who maneuvered their way to lucrative government contracts for the sales of arms to the United States government for use in the wars in the Middle East.Efraim Diveroli and David Packouz were the two wheeler-dealers who negotiated a $300 deal for guns and bullets for the Afghan National Army worth approximately $300 million. Their unsavory and illegals deals included such outrageous acts of purchasing Chinese ammunition, then removing the bullets from the cases to give the appearance of legitimacy.Eventually, the two arms dealers were busted by the FBI, yet given amazingly lenient sentencing. Perhaps this was the reason that the filmmakers did not take the subject very seriously. As interpreted by Jonah Hill and Miles Teller, the relationship of Efraim and David is portrayed in a whimsical manner with David as excessively naive and the Efraim with a puckish charm.But despite any shortcomings, the film is an eye-opening experience about the troubling way in which the government used tax payers' dollars for unlimited munitions contracts. The fact there was limited oversight in the transactions in an extremely disturbing in allowing two sleazy amateurs to work the system for their financial benefit.",War Dogs,2005151
31,goolizap,Twizard Rating: 89,9/10,9 September 2016,"Most people are going to want to see this film based on the trailer alone. It looks like a funny and adventurous heist movie of some sort. While it's not a comedy in the truest sense, it's just light enough to keep the audience involved.The film follows two twenty-somethings, Miles Teller and Jonah Hill, as they venture to the top of the international arms dealer industry. Amidst the war in Iraq, they use unorthodox techniques to fulfill US military contracts.War Dogs gets a little wordy when it's setting things up. Also, Teller's voice-over goes on a little bit too long at times. But while verbose when explaining things, it covers a lot of ground answering most of our questions in a Big Short type of way. Thus, a potentially byzantine premise never becomes convoluted.Teller plays David Packouz, the antiwar protagonist who is contributing to the war effort out of financial necessity. He's good, but Hill arguably carries the film, playing the real-life Efraim Diveroli. He's basically a selfish scumbag who could double as a mob boss at any given moment. Hill broadens his range as an actor with this role, proving he can play sinister along with his goofy trademark. He's so deceptively creepy that we become literally afraid of him.Genre-wise, it might seem to be stuck in limbo, but it's not. The comedy is evenly written and is balanced consistently into the drama. The exposition is fast-paced and doesn't require us to look back scratching our heads.War Dogs doesn't necessarily explore any new territory as far as the life of a criminal goes, but it's educational and entertaining every step of the way.Twizard Rating: 89",War Dogs,2005151

33,anaconda-40658,Todd Phillips Best Film Since The Hangover.,10/10,9 September 2016,"War Dogs (2016): Dir: Todd Phillips / Cast: Jonah Hill, Miles Teller, Ana de Armas, J.B. Blanc, Bradley Cooper: Tense action comedy about the lowest level of humanity. Jonah Hill plays a charming yet manipulative illegal arms dealer named Efraim Diveroli. Miles Teller plays a childhood friend named David Packouz whose past with Efraim landed him in trouble in the past. He is married and his wife is expecting their first child. He struggles in a business that sells bed sheets while dreading his job as a massage therapist. A chance encounter at a funeral reconnects the two and he is sucked into Efraim's dangerous world. Easily Todd Phillip's best film since The Hangover. Hill brings out the charisma of someone who does not care who he steps on to get rich. Teller as David sees opportunity until trust is broken and a trip to dangerous territory has him on his knees with a gun to his head. Ana de Armas plays David's frustrated wife who fears for their life and the safety of their child. She calls out David on his ongoing lies and his questionable loyalty to Efraim. Bradley Cooper plays a shady character named Henry Girard whom they deal with until merchandise turns up to be wrong and problematic. This is at times funny but often tension makes way for suspense as trouble closes in. Action scenes are fast paced with narrow escapes. Theme regards trust and those whom manipulate our lives into disaster. It also reveals the reality of cutting corners to prevail thus leading to severe consequences. The dogs bite savage in this chaotic and numbing action farce. Score: 10 / 10",War Dogs,2005151
34,dasa108,Fantastic film.,9/10,14 December 2022,"It is a great film, fast-paced, with well-defined characters and clear motivations. Two friends with certain business skills suddenly become big arms dealers and one on that transformational journey (one sees their skills and way of life radically change) can easily identify with one or the other. We then celebrate their performance successes as they display superhuman talent for problem solving and deception as well. It is a film without a clear moral and if one is in a state of mind close to that of an entrepreneur, this film will undoubtedly be an inspiration. It is very well done, recommended.

Teller is the best actor of his generation. Though this is probably not going to be his best performance this year. I have a feeling his performance in that Boxing film is Oscar bait. Jonah Hill plays the sort of character that he is best known for, but who cares he does it so well. I was not familiar with the female lead Ana De Armas, but she is mesmerizing.Bradley Cooper was terrific in a relatively small role as well.I can see hundreds of twenty somethings wanting to become War Dogs after seeing this film, but I a pretty certain that window of opportunity is closed. This has been a pretty disappointing year so far in film. My guilty pleasure was Tarzan, and I really liked Sing Street and 10 Cloverfield Lane but this is my first ten of the year. Maybe I should only have given it a 9, but I it certainly is the best film released in the last eight months, and you gotta give a 10 once in awhile.",War Dogs,2005151

You wouldn't think they would have the entrepreneurial savvy to pull off an ambitious money-making deal that could spell the success or doom of the US government's efforts to shore up the Afghan government's military capability. But something had to give.But it's also the lamentable story of a man who realizes that his best friend is not actually what he thought he is.Jonah Hill and Miles Teller are great together portraying characters with opposing traits. Great script, too, based on a true story. I was just wondering whether the ending actually happened. Could it just be an embellishment?

Seeing as it's all probably true, I can't see how anyone wouldn't enjoy War Dogs.By the way, here in Australia The Preppie Connection is marketed as The Cocaine Connection.

41,Rendanlovell,A dull movie with no new ideas,3/10,20 August 2016,"Miles Teller and Jonah Hill in a movie about international gun runners? Sign me up! Is what I was saying going into the film. Coming out was a different story. As is the story with many movies so far this year, 'War Dogs' is a boring mess of a movie. If you saw 'The infiltrator' or read my review you know I hated that film. And for the same reasons I hate that film, I hate this one. Except this one has the nerve to be nearly identical to the far superior 'Wolf Of Wall Street'. This movie hits all the same beats and story lines that Scorseses near masterpiece does. The difference between the two is that this one is neither funny nor entertaining to watch. It is quite possibly one of the most dull, lifeless, boring films I have seen this year. Every time something funny or stressful could have happened it just cuts to another scene. Or, even more upsetting, ques up a voice over track from Teller. It blatantly skips over possible character building scenes in favor of out of place, lazy voice overs.I don't think I would be lying when I say that there is more voice overs here than in 'Knight of Cups'. Which literally had not script. Why the choice was made to do this really comes down to laziness. There is no other reason to explain why it couldn't just let scenes play out. Not only was there countless voice overs that robbed scenes of tension, but it also did chapter kind of things.Every twenty minutes or so a black screen with a sentence appeared on screen, describing what we were about to see. Just like the voice work, it didn't seem to have a point to it. It just felt like it didn't know how to transfer to the next scene so it threw in these random titles. They came from no where and served literally no purpose other than to tell you what was going to happen before it did.But what was I expecting? Right from the first few scenes this film has jarring tones that clash with each other from scene to scene. The first shot of the movie is a tense scene involving a kidnapping and it cuts immediately to a stylized, scene with a pop song playing over top. It is a completely jarring tonal shift that is off and on through out the film. And, much like 'Suicide Squad' it has no idea how to place a song in a scene.The songs it chooses are good on their own but, the scenes they are used in makes me hate them. All but maybe once were they used appropriately. It's sad that films have decided to just throw in pop songs to try and get a bigger audience instead of making a score that works in the film. It never helps the story move forward, they are all just kind of there.That being said, nothing could have saved this story. As I said, it's exactly like 'Wolf of Wall Street'. But it's not near as fun nor does it have the interesting character study that 'Wall Street' has. It has Jonah Hill and Miles Teller furiously trying to make the dialogue they have sound organic. Yet, it's so poorly written that these Oscar worthy actors come across with little chemistry and sound like morons while doing it.There isn't much that redeems this film. It's mostly well shot and these two performances aren't to bad. Other than that everything fails. It's poorly written, horribly boring, offers no interesting characters, and fails to deliver any comedic moments. It's one of those movies that thinks it's so much better than it is. It wants to be great and desperately tries to be but falls flat on its face.",War Dogs,2005151
42,mm-39,worth watching,7/10,24 August 2016,"Non politically correct, has warts and all. Watching War Dogs is like watching a train wreck. You know the train wreck is going to happen, you just cannot help watch the wreck out of a morbid curiosity. War Dogs has stereotypes, ugly characters, and even nastier real life experiences. War Dogs is a buddy story of, David Packouz and Efraim Diveroli. When someone has a friend who a bad influence you know there is going to be trouble. No matter what the good intentions are you know the bad influence can not help but be himself. Everyone looks bad in War Dogs, governments, people and arms dealers. I felt the slime just ooze out! The moral message of easy money with fast people comes with a price hits hard! A good moral in of family/wife over money. War Dogs is directed at a fast pace, which transitions from sub story to sub story well. The Packouz/Diveroli characters create a synergy which drives a character driven story about decidence and greed. 7 out of 10",War Dogs,2005151
43,cosmo_tiger,"This is my type of movie; true, interesting, funny, & makes you feel anger & fear toward certain characters. I highly recommend it",10/10,21 November 2016,"""The entire defense industry was scrambling over this deal and the key to it was sitting in 23 shipping containers in the back of a rusted out warehouse on the other side of the world."" David Packouz (Teller) is a salesman that is struggling to make money, then he reconnects with his old friend Efraim (Hill). The two go into business selling small arms to the US Military, and the better they do the more respected they become. When they up the stakes and take on a $300 million contract to deliver ammunition everything changes. I was really looking forward to this movie. I love the actors, the story was interesting and it is true which makes things better. I was not disappointed at all. The movie was tense, action packed, full of drama and very funny. Almost had a Wolf of Wall Street type vibe mixed with a splash of Goodfellas. This is a movie that you can't talk about too much because there are so many turns in this it would be a shame to give something away. What I will say is that this is a definite must see movie and one that I could watch over and over. This is my type of movie; true, interesting, funny, and makes you feel anger and fear toward certain characters. I highly recommend this and easily give this an A+.",War Dogs,2005151
44,dromasca,selling weapons is not nice kids business,6/10,26 August 2016,"'War Dogs' is the second movie 'inspired by a true story' that I have seen in the last 24 hours, and is actually the one that I liked better (the other one being 'The Infiltrator'). Its film-making style (director Todd Phillips) and its comic thriller approach fit well the month of August. If I am to chose one easier entertainment with no super-heroes or space-ships, and yet a film that raises serious issues this summer, I will recommend it (but of course, I did not see them all).I am not sure if 'War Dogs' will make it to too many Jewish film festivals, but the two lead characters are Jewish or better say one nice Jewish kid (acted by Miles Teller) and a one Jewish trouble-maker kid (acted by Jonah Hill) who meet about one year after high-school. The bad guy is already in weapons trade and he easily convinces the good guy to become an associate. It's the Bush-Cheney period, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan need arms, and the government seems to have privatized at least part of the guns and ammo supply chain and opened it to free competition. A golden business opportunity for many, including the couple of young entrepreneurs who start small, win bigger and bigger contracts, break more and more moral rules, laws and trade restrictions, move into bigger offices and houses, and ask themselves less and less questions about what is right and what is wrong to do in such business.The film is fun to watch. There is no great characters development, the characters are from the start to the end what they seem to be when they show up for the first time, but they are enjoyable, and Jonah Hill at least does here his best role on screen to date. Bradley Cooper also shows up in a small but key supporting role. Story telling has pace and humor, although I could have given up the off-screen story telling which tries to provide the personal and somehow moralizing perspective of the good guy. It seems to be a returning fashion in the American cinema which I frankly dislike. It usually hides lack of skills in setting the contest and telling the story, but it was not the case here.It's the final titles before the credits, the one that usually relate the characters on screen with the reality of the 'true story' and show the real faces of the 'heroes' that we have seen acted on screen, that made me click. So these guys, who sold lethal weapons that caused death in the battlefields of Iraq or Afghanistan, who tricked the government and the individuals fighting for what they believe is a just cause got a few years in jail (one of them) and a suspended sentence (the other one) and they are now selling their story in books and movies? Something is broken in our justice systems if the 'war dogs' selling illegal weapons to the conflict areas are not punished. This film is not a masterpiece, but at least it causes to some of us to ask the right questions.",War Dogs,2005151
45,Kingslaay,Fantastic!,8/10,19 August 2016,"When I went to this movie I had little expectations, I was expecting some average or sub par movie with a plot holes, silly laughs and the odd nudity. It was certainly marketed to be like this to some extent. But what I got was a very well executed and entertaining film, its safe to say it far exceeded expectations.War dogs is a great story about two friends who partner up and become international arms dealers landing a huge Afghan contract to supply arms to American allies. The film contains the right amount of drama as well as some good doses of humor thrown in such as Jonah Hill's eccentric laugh throughout the film. The humor works very well but at the same time it is an entertaining drama with some very good scenes such as the one where the two protagonists escape gunfire in Iraq when they were delivering weapons. The film has elements of a Greek tragedy similar to what we have seen with Goodfellas and The Wolf of Wall Street that depicts the rise, glory and eventual downfall of the characters with the FBI eventually showing up at your door. The soundtrack was also very good and the performances were great. Teller and Hill may not deserve an Oscar but they deserve a nomination. Their characters were developed nicely and you could feel the tension throughout the movie. I would say this movie would definitely satisfy the viewer and leave you pleasantly surprised. A strong 8/10",War Dogs,2005151
46,cultfilmfan,War Dogs,10/10,20 August 2016,"I was so hoping that War Dogs, would be a breakthrough film for writer/director Todd Phillips, much in the way that last year's The Big Short, was not only the most mature film of writer/director Adam McKay's career, but it was also what I would consider to be his best film and it even won him an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay, amongst other nominations and honours that the film received. I say this because up till this point, both Phillips and McKay had been known mostly for lowbrow comedies that were obnoxious, crude and featured very juvenile humour and antics which would probably appeal to teenagers and maybe guys in their early 20's, but after that the appeal would greatly diminish within older and more mature viewers. I admit and I have my reviews on this site to prove that I have liked past works by both these directors, but again they were just amusing comedies that I would see once and then probably not bother with again and while humorous and entertaining at the time, they would have no lasting impact, or affect on me other than having a few chuckles amongst the other filmgoers at the theatre. McKay broke through this barrier last year with The Big Short, and now he has plans to do other more serious and yet entertaining films like one he has lined up with Jennifer Lawrence, and while I am sure he will still do his immature comedies, he has proved that he can and has the ability to do more serious and ultimately much better work. Having now seen War Dogs, I can safely say that not only has Phillips shown his truest talent as a writer, director and ultimately as a filmmaker, but I also think like McKay he has made the best film of his career. War Dogs much like The Big Short, focuses on real people and events that unfold before our eyes and the film is very satirical at times and also gives a good commentary on things such as how these two young men could have conned the American government the way they did and basically how easy it was for them to get filthy rich and do so under everyone's noses, or without them being aware. The film looks at war and weapons and how the American government goes about it's daily business with these types of foreign affairs and activities and the filmmakers here give a very critical and sometimes scathing look at such things showing that as voters, citizens and everyday people, we really sometimes have no clue as to what our government officials are up to, or what goes on behind the scenes and it also leaves one thinking that these people must not always be completely competent, or on top of things the way they should have been because otherwise we wouldn't have a film like War Dogs, or a true story and events such as this film depicts because anyone who knew what was going on would have put an end to it a long time ago, or so I hope. The film is just as good as any political spoof, or skewering by offering up many things for us as viewers to both be amazed and horrified at in equal measures. All the while though, Phillips proves he can tell a good story and both make an impact with it and completely engulf us into the world of arms dealings and the seedy goings on that these characters were involved in. The film can be quite humorous at times both in crude ways which Phillips still knows how to do, but yet he improves upon here and yet the film is so riveting that while not a thriller we are still so fascinated by what is going on in front of us that it would be a major mistake to leave the theatre even for a couple minutes and dare miss a second of this riveting story unfolding before us. The film's script is sharp with both it's quite perceptive and sometimes painfully accurate criticisms of what these two men did as well as the failure at the time of the American government, but it also raises good questions about what anyone would resort to and what depths, or lows we might go to in order to make a name for ourselves and be filthy rich even if it means facing major consequences. The acting here from the whole cast is also excellent and some of the finest work of both Jonah Hill and Miles Teller. Phillips has proved he can make one great film and I hope like McKay they continue to make serious and thought provoking films of a higher quality like this and not just go for the easy, or stupid laughs like in the past because in both cases that would be more or less selling themselves out and isn't that basically what they were both against with these two movies? I hope they will continue to work seriously, but as it stands, War Dogs is one of this year's finest achievements and overall best films.",War Dogs,2005151
47,darkreignn,The best movie of the summer,9/10,23 August 2016,"Just before I start this review, I would like to thank the person who messaged me and said that they enjoy my reviews. I would reply to you personally, but for some reason my account will not verify. If you are reading this, I thank you because your message really meant a lot to me!""War Dogs"" stars Jonah Hill and Miles Teller, and is an absolute blast and no doubt the best movie of the summer. First off, Jonah Hill's performance is so energetic, hilarious, and fun to watch. I don't want to spoil anything about his character, but let's just say he's very unpredictable, and very funny. He has some lines in this movie that will make you bust a gut laughing, and he's also surprisingly cool. He has a great scene involving drug dealers that I won't spoil, but it's one of the most entertaining scenes of the film. Miles Teller plays more of the serious man in this role, and he is just as good. He gives a compelling, sympathetic, and believable performance, and the relationship between him and his girlfriend, Ana de Armas, (who is probably the most beautiful person on the planet) is sweet to watch, and I enjoyed the romance and drama between them.The chemistry between Miles and Jonah felt real; they felt like childhood friends, and you could tell they had fun playing off of each other. Jonah felt like the person everyone wanted to be, while Miles felt like the person everyone became. In other words, Jonah was the fantasy and Miles was the reality, if that makes any sense. However you want to word it, the dichotomy between them worked well and they were both supremely entertaining.Also, Bradley Cooper has a small role in this movie, and he delivers what is probably the coolest line of the entire movie. He was so good, and I wish he played a more prominent role in the film, but what we got of him was great.While this movie is marketed as a comedy, it is more of a very fun and interesting drama with some really funny moments. ""War Dogs"" is pretty much non-stop fun from start to finish, and is, in my opinion, the best film that Todd Phillips has made so far.",War Dogs,2005151

49,namashi_1,A Dynamite! Jonah Hill Is Da Man!,9/10,20 August 2016,"Based on a Rolling Stone article by Guy Lawson, 'War Dogs' is a BLAST! Director & Co-Writer Todd Phillips regains supremacy in this racy, darkly funny & entirely amusing criminal comedy-drama, that is bolstered by a compelling performance by Jonah Hill. I had a ball. 'War Dogs' Synopsis: Based on the true story of two young men, David Packouz (Miles Teller) and Efraim Diveroli (Jonah Hill), who won a $300 million contract from the Pentagon to arm America's allies in Afghanistan.'War Dogs' is about achieving ""The Great American Dream"", at any cost. You watch 2 young fellas sweating it out, running around & even literally going nuts in the middle of warfare in Jordan, (The entire chapter in Jordan, is a standout). The two leading-men aren't particularly likable, but its one hell of a ride, to watch them hustle, lie, cheat & steal from all ends. 'War Dogs' is a true-story, that has turned into a terrific film, that keeps you on your seat & swings itself with hilarity & sheer menace.The Screenplay by Stephen Chin, Jason Smilovic & Phillips, is explosive. The narrative arrests you & doesn't let you go. Its so much fun watching the two young bloods doing so much wrong, to get it right. Phillips's Direction is super. Its good to see him back in form, after a hiatus. 'War Dogs' is definitely among his best films to date! Lawrence Sher's Cinematography captures the greed & madness, with fineness. Jeff Groth's Editing is razor-crisp, 114-minutes swing by smoothly. Art & Costume Design are excellent. The brief action-bits are well-done. Cliff Martinez's Score is perfect.Performance-Wise: While its Miles Teller who gets the main role (and also does a voice-over throughout the film), 'War Dogs' still belongs to Jonah Hill. Jonah, an actor who never fails to surprise, is simply fabulous. Jonah sinks his teeth into the part & performs with enviable bravado. He's every bit of the greedy a-hole he plays & gets the best lines as well, who he delivers with his uniqueness. Also, his laugh, is another highlight. Having said that, Miles is quite-good as well, but this is Jonah's show & he owns it. Ana de Armas looks gorgeous & plays the mandatory female influence, with honesty. Kevin Pollak is first-rate. Bradley Cooper shines in an extended cameo.On the whole, 'War Dogs' is a Dynamite! Don't miss it. And how about a 3rd Oscar-Nomination for Jonah?",War Dogs,2005151
50,eddie_baggins,An energetic and fun gun-running trip,7/10,21 August 2016,"With one of those true life stories that you'd never believe had it not actually happened at its disposal, Old School and The Hangover director Todd Phillips and his capable duo of Miles Teller (in need of a hit) and the scenery chewing Jonah Hill (going all method on us) make War Dogs an entertaining and quick-fire experience that shines a light on an interesting aspect of White House law and how strange our modern warfare has become. A dark comedy filled to the brim with deplorable and colourful characters, language and drug addled life lessons, War Dogs is one of those somewhat uneasy hybrids that flirts the line between becoming and out and out drama or an outright comedy and while Phillips at times finds his directional abilities tested in a tale that has a number of different aspects going on at any one time the story of best friends turned gun running business partners David Packouz and Efraim Diveroli is brought to life by Teller and Hill thanks to their considerable talents and the two actors know doubt elevate the material at their disposal to another level.The talents of these two performers has been evident in such tales as Whiplash, The Spectacular Now, The Wolf of Wall Street and Moneyball and while War Dogs won't be going down on their all-time greatest list and Hill has a tendency to take things a little too far (his Efraim is a nigh on irremediably arrogant creature and his laugh is a little much) the two work up a good cooperation on screen and when they're both doing their thing from a near suicidal gun run through the Iraq wastelands or conducting a government meeting while far from clear headed, War Dogs is a film owned by the actors.Who would've thought that two mid 20 year old's with a tendency for drugs, alcohol and massages could've become arms dealers for the United States Government but War Dogs makes good use of its bizarre yet true story and while the film isn't as smart as it perhaps thinks it is, this is a fun and breezy experience that would make for a great double bill with the underrated Nichols Cage starrer Lord of War. 3 ½ golden grenades out of 5",War Dogs,2005151
51,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"It is definitely style over substance, but it is enjoyable and worth a watch despite having little staying power.",6/10,2 September 2016,"'War Dogs (2016)' is, a comedy/drama starring Jonah Hill and Miles Teller as a pair of amateur arms-dealers, directed by Todd Phillips of 'The Hangover (2009)' fame. The film is loosely based on a true story, even featuring a cameo by the actual person portrayed by Teller, though it takes several liberties with its source material. The feature isn't as controversial or important as it perhaps thinks it is, but it is still mostly entertaining with good performances despite having little beneath the surface.The movie spends more time trying to create a style then it does trying to inject the story with substance, and as a whole suffers for it. The narration is very expositional and feels lazy, not to mention that the film freeze-frames for no reason other than for Teller to get his voice-over out, and the semi-frequent use of stock-footage gets a little annoying as it feels rather out of place. The other thing that gets on my nerves is the intermittent quotation title cards, used as unnecessary chapter breaks. These short asides are never needed, their unnecessary nature compounded by the fact that they always contain a quote that's then said in dialogue just minutes later. They also don't separate distinct parts of the plot, such as time-jumps or location changes, and thus beg the question as to why they were included. The stylistic choices hark back to 'The Wolf Of Wall Street (2013)' and 'The Big Short (2015)', but they never add up to something unique and instead feel like retreads. Because these elements never feel consistent, the film itself comes across as poorly disciplined. The story is interesting most of the time, and the two lead characters provide engaging screen presences, though the film does drag its heels in its second act. As a whole it feels a bit too long, lacking a proper finale and leaving us with a relatively weak conclusion. There isn't really any danger and the characters tend to enjoy what they're doing. In the end, it all seems mainly inconsequential as it is mostly consequence-free and focused on frivolous antics. It doesn't get as deep into the ethics of the situation as it should, leading to a light and fluffy affair with little staying power. The other issues with the story are that it is generally unmemorable, spends too much time on set-up but not enough on pay-off and features weak characterisation.Aside from than the two leads, the other players don't have anything to do - even Ana de Armas' character is only included to provide a motive for Teller's protagonist to do what he does. It's a shame as there are some great actors here; the best performance is given by Bradley Cooper but he is barely on screen. Thankfully, the two leads are good. Hill delivers another diverse dramatic performance that proves he can really act, while Teller is solid as essentially a surrogate for the audience. The script is decent, featuring fairly naturalistic dialogue and some witty banter. However, I don't find the film funny at all. When I watched it, the audience I saw it with laughed consistently while I barely cracked a smile. It doesn't take away from the flick's overall success, but I feel as though the thing definitely works better as a drama than a comedy. That's why it is a shame that it goes for style and humour over depth and emotion. I think it would have been a much more engaging film if it was a little darker and more contemplative.Technically speaking, everything is good here. The direction is competent, bordering on proficient, but it is unremarkable on the whole and goes largely unnoticed. The cinematography is clean, crisp and efficient. The movie feels tangible from start to finish, with real locations being used frequently and the occasional action being shot neatly. The music is slightly underwhelming, lacking a memorable original score and flittering between licenced pieces frequently. The song choices are quite generic and have been used before under similar circumstances, but they tend to fit the scene they're in and never detract from the experience.Overall, 'War Dogs (2016)' is an enjoyable film that is a clear example of style over substance. The performances are good, the script is entertaining and the plot is mostly engaging, but a lack of depth hurts the staying power of the picture. It is unmemorable and unimportant, but it's a decent time and worth a watch at least once: 6/10.",War Dogs,2005151

But why to film the action in Albania from ""War Dogs""(2016), in Romania, I do not quite understand, with Romanian actors who speak Romanian instead of Albanian and with the super-ginormous ""The People's House"" in the background, symbol of the megalomania of Nicolae Ceausescu and not of Enver Hoxha's paranoia... ? Americans... They don't know Geography, they think that The Eiffel Tower is in USA and Bulgaria is a country in Africa... OK. In rest, except some good old songs in the soundtrack, the film is boring, only static dialogue from start to finish. The only good thing(for them too) is that Samuel L. Jackson and Morgan Freeman (always presents in any film in recent years...), are not in this film!

55,deloudelouvain,War and weapons are a necessity for some countries,8/10,28 April 2017,"One of the better movies I saw in the last month and I watch between two and three movies per day. It's an interesting look on the weapon industry. Also the fact that it is based on a true story makes it even more interesting. It's just appalling that almost anybody could trade and sell any gun or ammunition without questions asked. In fact the buyers practically don't even want to know where they came from. The most important is that they can get them cheap. Jonah Hill is funny to watch, even in a bit more serious movie like this one. Because this movie has it's funny moments but it's not really a comedy when you think about the subject. The subject is war and weapons. It's an industry. Whole countries just need wars and weapons business. The USA are in a perpetual war, they are always at war with somebody, and that since they exist. It's a billion dollar business and they just can't afford not being at war. The movie is well shot, with a good cast, and an incredible story. Certainly worth at least one watch.

56,Fiurilli,Another disappointing summer movie,4/10,22 August 2016,"In 'War Dogs' we follow Miles Teller and Jonah Hill as two young men trying to make money from the war in Iraq by selling weapons to the US army. The movie is directed by Todd Phillips who is better known for the 'The Hangover' trilogy.Right of the bat the movie tries to seem more clever than it actually is. Via a flash-forward that shows one of the main characters in a predicament the movie tries to create a sense of tension that would otherwise have been non-apparent. This quickly fades as the story is very predictable with characters that are not all that interesting considering their motives are never properly explained and very flimsy. Throughout the movie is some narration paired with title cards indicating different chapters. Most of the times the chapters do not seem any different which made these title cards unnecessary and it is clear they were just added afterwards in as a last ditch effort to make the movie more interesting. Halfway trough the movie almost comes to a grinding halt and from thereon out it never really manages to get the viewer's interest back.The directing was very bland, considering not one scene was shot in a very interesting fashion. Often times it seemed as if the movie does not really know what it wants to be. Sometimes character's respond to a certain situation in a comedic fashion while other times the tone is shifted to a more serious one. Todd Phillips never really tries to mix in some of his own style and with another director the movie would've probably turned out roughly the same. The only redeeming factor of the movie are the actors themselves as they did a decent job at portraying their characters, though ultimately not one performance was very memorable. In the end 'War Dogs' joins the 2016 collection of disappointing summer movies.My rating: 4/10",War Dogs,2005151
57,FlashCallahan,I live off crumbs.....,7/10,14 September 2016,"Two friends exploit a government initiative that allows small businesses to bid on U.S. Military contracts. Before they know it, they begin raking in big money and living the high life. But the pair get in over their heads when they land a 300 million dollar deal to arm the Afghan MilitaryBut it's a deal that puts them in business with some very shady people, not the least of which turns out to be the U.S. Government.......It's apparently based on true events, but just how much of the narrative is true, eg. the gun running and risking their lives to uphold a contract is questionable.It's Tellers film by a long-shot, the film is from his point of view, and his observations are very interesting, and make for some quite tense viewing.And then Hill comes in and puts in a performance that almost mirrors his role in Wolf Of Wall Street. And you know that he's putting in such a good performance, when you begin to hate his characters ideals, and just what a poisonous, selfish, immature being he actually is. It's not a criticism of Hill, it's just an observation of what a brilliant performance he puts in.It's Lord Of War meets Wolf Of Wall Street, not as good as either of those, but it has you caring for characters who are wholly despicable, which is pretty good going for a film directed by the man who gave us the godawful Hangover movies.It's a pretty bizarre film, although it's set in the late noughties, it has an eighties feel to it, almost Michael Mann-esque.Top it all with a wonderfully sinister cameo from Bradley Cooper, this has to be one of the surprises of the year, because it's not terrible, it's actually quite good.",War Dogs,2005151
58,d-delaunay,Amazing story !,8/10,25 July 2022,"War dogs are people who profit from war without directly participating in it. Inspired by real facts, this film traces the journey of Efraim Diveroli and David Packouz, two independents, specialists in the sale of weapons by responding to calls for tender from the U. S. Army. This film shows both the financial potential of this system and its limits.

59,Hellmant,Cool to see Hill playing somewhat of a villain!,8/10,22 August 2016,"'WAR DOGS': Four Stars (Out of Five)The new 'men behaving badly' comedy flick from writer/director/producer Todd Phillips (the man who also brought us 'OLD SCHOOL', 'ROAD TRIP', 'DUE DATE' and all three 'HANGOVER' movies). The film is based on a Rolling Stone article, by Guy Lawson, about two twenty-something arms dealers, that land a U.S. contract to supply weapons to Afghanistan military forces. Phillips directed, co- produced and co-wrote the movie; with Stephen Chin and Jason Smilovic. It stars Miles Teller, Jonah Hill, Ana de Armas, Kevin Pollak and Bradley Cooper (who also co-produced the flick). The movie's received mixed reviews from critics, and it's done mildly well at the Box Office. I liked it, but it's definitely no 'HANGOVER' (it is far better than it's two sequels though).David Packouz (Teller) was working (unhappily) as a massage therapist, in Miami Beach during the Iraq War. His girlfriend Iz (Armas) unexpectedly became pregnant, and David decided he desperately needed a new source of income. So when he runs into his old childhood friend, Efraim Diveroli (Hill), at another old friend's funeral, he learns he can make a lot of money selling guns to the U.S. military (like Efraim already is). The two form a partnership, and get rich (really fast), but they also run into some serious problems.The movie is only loosely based on true events; a lot of it is entirely made up (which makes for a more entertaining film, of course). It's nice to see Phillips branching out as a filmmaker (and I really wasn't impressed with the two 'HANGOVER' sequels), and it's also cool to see Hill playing somewhat of a villain. Teller is perfectly cast as the relatable lead, but he's capable of much more than this though ('WHIPLASH' is one of the greatest movies ever made, in my opinion). This film is fun (at times), and kind of interesting. It's a little too dark, to be a lot of fun though, and a little too light, to be really interesting (in a very serious way, anyway). The performances are good though.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/WJl7HNQ4N_4",War Dogs,2005151
60,tjgoalie13,"Somewhat Funny, but Riddled with Clichés",6/10,23 August 2016,"War Dogs seems like a film with a ton of potential, because of the people involved in it, but lacks the spark to make it anything other than okay. The problem seems to be that the crew wanted to tell a true story and make the audience laugh but didn't fully understand, given the source material, how to do that. War Dogs is intermittently funny, but relies too much on clichés, and fails to pack any kind of a punch. If you're trying to figure out what kind of a movie this is, picture The Big Short with a slightly lesser known crew.War Dogs did have a lot going for it, namely the talents of Miles Teller and Jonah Hill, as well as the direction of Todd Phillips (The Hangover Trilogy.) Above that the trailers for this film looked fairly funny, but note that almost all of the genuinely funny parts of the movie are contained in the trailer. That being said the film often tries to take a more dramatic approach, and fails to ever generate a hilarious moment. That being said both Miles Teller and Jonah Hill's performances are great in this film.While Teller and Hill are great in this film it really feels too familiar, as if you've seen it before. That shouldn't be the case with a film about two men in their twenties running guns in the Iraq War. That being said it ends up making it's characters into clichés, and tells an overdone storyline about rags to riches idiots, and betrayal of best friends. It really is a shame because, as I mentioned before, this film could've been very original and interesting, but ends up being like most other films of today, more recycled than anything else.Above that the film fails, at what it ultimately wants to do, which is pack a punch. It seems self evident watching it, that the director and writers wanted to expose a scary problem in America, and at the same time generate a few laughs. In that sense it's a lot like The Big Short, however War Dogs fails to ever do what it strives to do. Where The Big Short was informational, funny, and in the end terrifyingly honest, War Dogs is not. This movie may have a moment or two, but seems to miss it's intended mark on both ends, in that it's not as funny as it'd like to be nor is it as damning. In the end War Dogs feels like more of an average film, which is disappointing because it had the potential to do everything wanted to. If you expect a great comedy, it's not really that, if you're expecting a great look at true and terrifying events that led to two young immature men running guns for America, it's not really that either. War Dogs is funny, well acted, and has a story to tell, but relies on clichés, stereotypes, and doesn't offer very much thought provoking material. This is a good film if you want a few chuckles but it doesn't supply a ton of laughs.",War Dogs,2005151
61,LeonLouisRicci,Not Funny Failure....Obnoxious & Bland Satire About Gun-Running,5/10,4 January 2017,"A Drama/Comedy about a couple of Real-Life Scumbags (no not Bush and Cheney) but Two Twenty Something Buds who have a Jolly Good Time Making Money Selling War Weapons.The Actual Shooting and Maiming of Real People is Hardly Questioned and left Off-Screen. That would be a Buzz-Kill. Because this Movie's Moral Center is All Over the Middle East Map with some Grounding in America's Upper Class Landscape.The Film is Mildly Entertaining if You find War-Profiteering Mildly Entertaining. The Movie is Obnoxious, just like Jonah Hill and Bland, just like Martin Tiller.It's all Slick and Shiny with very Little Insight and Fails to make much of a Statement about the Bush War, or Cheney's Haliburton, aside from Well Known Surface Stuff. The Music Cues are Scorsese-Esque and the Attitude Toward Guns and War are Shallow Sensational ""Scarface"" Stuff.The Film seems to Think that Lying to One's Wife is more of a Crime than anything else that is going on here.

62,johnnybravophone-dy,wolf of wall street part 2,8/10,15 August 2016,"as one user said in the forums title pretty much sums up this movie. and its not a bad thing at all. though it wont be as graphic as w.o.w., the movie does have its scenes. pretty much a fun ride with a sweet rush and Jonah Hill makes it very comic. i do recommend this movie and would watch again. if you like seeing how two young Americans came to be millionaires doing illegal actions than you are safe here. I mean who wouldn't want to see that. Also Miles Teller makes a great duo with Jonah, perfect crew for a blast of a movie. but enough of my shenanigans check it out and thanks me later. dusty webb signing out. 8/10

63,coreyjdenford,War is a funny business,6/10,27 August 2016,"This is my review of War Dogs (spoiler free).*** (3/5) Cast: Jonah Hill, Miles Teller, Ana de Armas, Bradley Cooper.Plot: Two men who were best friends in high school decide to reunite and become arms dealers, but as their life they get a deal that could possibly be the best deal for them, however this deal could be a big mistake for these two.War Dogs is sold as a comedy. Yet it is the most serious adult war comedy out there. After director Todd Phillips' made an impact in the comedy world with the Hangover trilogy yes even the clunky, unfunny sequels. This is quite a challenge for him as he tries to create grown-up material without a naked Ken Jeong leaping on one of their faces. Yet he succeed with a sort of funny adult war story that has a few laughs sprouting every now and then but it is mostly serious. David Packouz (Teller, still keeping his master performance from Whiplash in play) is a man who wants more from his life rather than being a salesman of expensive Egyptian sheets and his life as a licensed masseuses, until he sees an old friend from high school Efraim Diveroli (Hill) and they get back together again. David and Efraim are now friends again and Efraim introduces him to his job and he is instantly jealous of his life. Although this feels much like the Wolf of Wall Street especially with the narration this mainly comes from David this makes the whole experience a whole lot better.As the story goes on the comedy standards get better and funnier and this also makes for fun dialogue, mainly said by the two lead characters. However the two lead actors are both ten years older than the characters they are playing yet with their riveting performances you seem to forget that. It's also filled with pretty good action although not as good as a Scorsese masterpiece but the pacing feels the same in this and the pacing is spaced out to show that the director certainly didn't rush to make this feature. There is pretty good action not much in terms of violence but mainly from the use of guns, and also the funny one liners each of the lead roles come out with. In one scene when the two friends go to Albania a country literally torn by war they have to deliver a ton of ammo in a very short time but as this goes through David has to stay there alone while, Efraim gets drunk and also he does the most sinister thing ever which will probably end their friendship, however Efraim realizes his mistake and tries to make it better, without success. There are even emotional standards in the film. Although filled with masculinity apart from the one woman Ana de Armas' Iz who is David's girlfriend but that is all the femininity that this film has to offer so mostly men. Especially with Bradley Cooper's top arms dealer Henry Girard's random outburst ""See this is why I like arms dealing - no women."" Although apart from all the funny outbursts this peace of comedy is mostly serious, with a much similar tone to Whiskey Tango Foxtrot another comedy about a war torn country and the lead role goes there to try an sort things out. So essentially based on the Hangover series and yes even the Wolf of Wall Street, this shows to be a film that is based around war time can serious and funny at the same time.Verdict: Buoyed by riveting performances and pretty action, this proves that Todd Phillips can do grown-up material without a naked Ken Jeong.6/10 Rude and laugh out loud funny.",War Dogs,2005151
64,PopSpective_net,'War Dogs' Proves Life Is Often Stranger than Fiction,9/10,19 August 2016,"Holy crap.That is my summary of War Dogs. The movie was produced by Todd Phillips–director of the Hangover movies–and Bradley Cooper. The truly crazy part, though, is that War Dogs is real-life. It's a story based on actual events, but if you didn't know that it wouldn't seem much different than one of the Hangover movies.The movie focuses on a two twenty-something friends in Miami Beach who become international arms dealers. Their company–AEY–leveraged a federal website to find and land lucrative contracts with the Pentagon. Efraim Diveroli (Jonah Hill) and David Packouz (Miles Teller) eventually landed a $300 million contract to arm the Afghan military, but government corruption and some illegal decisions on their part proved to be their undoing.All of this went down only a few short years ago. Diveroli and Packouz–as AEY– were able to take advantage of an initiative implemented by the Bush administration to expand federal contract opportunities to small businesses. In 2011, however, the two were convicted of multiple counts of fraud. Diveroli was sentenced to four years in federal prison, while Packouz was sentenced to seven months' house arrest.If you want all of the salacious details, read the lengthy feature article in Rolling Stone written by Guy Lawson. It was this article that first caught Todd Phillips attention and led to the War Dogs movie project.In a Q&A following the screening I saw, Phillips and Cooper shared some of the back story and their experiences making the movie. Phillips said the project was built around the idea of Jonah Hill starring in from the beginning. In fact, Phillips said that he had actually been trying to work with Hill for years–revealing that he originally tried to get Hill to be in The Hangover as the younger brother. The role was eventually re-imagined as an older brother and given to Zach Galifianakis instead.It seems like a brilliant choice. I don't know how Efraim Diveroli acts in real life, but Hill seems like a natural in the role. Miles Teller also does an excellent job as Packouz–the character through whose eyes the movie is told.If you've seen the Hangover movies, you know how that group of friends manages to get into a lot of trouble resulting from a series of comical errors and bad decisions. That's pure fiction, though. Phillips relayed the story of how he first learned about and became interested in this story. ""I remember, I was literally flying to Bangkok–we were shooting Hangover 2–and I read it in Rolling Stone just like anybody. I just couldn't–the thing that attracted me is I couldn't believe it was real, honestly. It just felt like it was one of those, um–you know, if it was a piece of fiction in The New Yorker I would have said, 'Oh. That's a cool story. Cool characters. But, it's so unbelievable it kind of doesn't work.'"" The Q&A moderator asked, ""Bradley, when you found out about the story, was there anything that really surprised you? Where you were just like, 'This couldn't be true'?"" Cooper replied, ""Oh my God. Where do we start?"" Granted, this is a movie that is ""based on a true story"", which means that there is some artistic license and embellishment for the sake of entertainment. Phillips stressed that this is not a documentary, but also shared that Lawson–who is more familiar with the story than just about anybody other than Efraim and David themselves–expressed that he was pleasantly surprised with the journalistic integrity of the film.War Dogs is an excellent movie. The acting is exceptional and the story is engaging. It is 114 minutes of entertainment that will be worth every penny you pay to see it. The fact that it is somehow a true story of two anonymous young men doing something extraordinary is just icing on the cake.",War Dogs,2005151
65,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of War Dogs,8/10,19 August 2016,"The rise and fall of the American dream gets the veritable Todd Phillips treatment. And after 15 years of directing explicit comedies, he decides to venture elsewhere with the meta-drama, War Dogs (my latest review). Good for him. ""Dogs"" closely resembles the 2006 vehicle Lord of War except that it's far from dull. With a certain amount of flamboyance, a more entertaining flow, and Bradley Cooper in a steely-eyed, supporting role, War Dogs is the kind of movie Lord of War wish it could have been. Bravo Todd the bod. You went out of your comfort zone to channel a little Martin Scorsese (the use of freeze frames, voice-over narration, and freewheeling camera movement) and the result is one of 2016's best. ""War, huh good God, y'all"". Indeed. Anyway, ""Dogs"" is based on a true story and takes place anywhere between Miami Beach, Florida to Albania to Jordan to the largest city in Iraq (that would be um, Baghdad). There are decent performances from the two leads (Jonah Hill and Miles Teller), a favorable use of dialogue- inserted title cards, and biting soundtrack tunes spanning at least four decades. Yeah I was a little unfulfilled with the way ""Dogs"" ended or if it even had an actual ending. No matter. This Warner Bros. release is sumptuous in every frame. Whether it's giving us long shots of high-rise condos in South Florida, rapid editing by way of business computers (and bookkeeping), plenty of characters smoking dubage, and even a poolside scene straight out of Scarface (the flick War Dogs references frequently), ""Dogs"" is a step above most cinema endeavors that have hit theaters in the dog days of August. Just call director Todd Phillips the surprising lovechild of 90's Scorsese and Andrew Niccol. The only difference is that he is not quite as self-serious.With a running time of just under 2 hours (114 minutes to be exact) and featuring the stunning Ana de Armas (Knock Knock, Exposed) as its love interest, War Dogs chronicles two twentysomethings named Efraim Diveroli (Jonah Hill) and David Packouz (Miles Teller). David lives with his pregnant girlfriend and is just getting by financially with his massage and (nursing home) bed sheet businesses. Efraim is his best friend and just happens to be an arms dealer operating out of Los Angeles. Hill's character saddled with plenty of cockiness and will, takes David out of his life of doldrums all the while showing him how to make some real money. They team up to form a company and land a $300 million dollar arms deal that gets them in over their heads. There are random bits of humor here, suggestive language, a slight of hand towards the Bush administration, some mild violence, and plenty of guns (duh). Ultimately, this is Todd's best and most full-grown work. He should do films like this more often and stop resorting to his frat boy tendencies. Rating: 3 and a half stars.",War Dogs,2005151
66,rmax304823,Arms and the Men.,7/10,29 July 2017,"Miles Teller, who looks and sounds a bit like John Cusack, is a nice Jewish young man, just trying to get along in Miami by giving massages and selling first-class sheets to the many old age homes. His wife, Ana de Armas, doesn't really care. But Miles' life course is full of bumps. He meets an old high school friend, plump Jonah Hill, who involves him in a money-making scheme selling armaments and ammunition to the US Army. Maybe some others. I was lost from time to time.Well, I'll tell you, the money rolls in. It rolls in in barrels, visible even through the cloud of smoke from all the weed they do. There are cascades of one hundred dollar bills. They drive Porches. And all those thousands of first-class sheets of Egyptian cotton that Miles had bought? He and Hill make a mountain of those boxes and jubilantly set fire to them. Their arms empire grows. It expands from two ambitious guys to a vast international group of shady characters. The flow chart turns murky. What the shady characters are doing is outside the box but apparently legal enough, though dangerous. Then they discover that some AK-47 ammunition, left over in Albania from the Cold War, was made in China. It's illegal to sell Chinese-made ammunition to the US Army. So they set about anxiously repackaging the millions of dollars worth of ammo, from heavy wooden crates to fiberboard boxes, which gets rid of the Chinese ideograms on the wooden boxes.But somebody squeals and one by one the organization is taken down by the FBI.This sound a little complicated, and it is, but we're helped along by Miles Teller's matter-of-fact narration. He tells us what's going on every step of the way, often during a freeze frame. There are overhead shots. There are vicious arguments with the wife. Hill, who is the springboard for all this chicanery, turns out to be a perfidious boss. There is judicious use of contemporary pop music from the likes of Crosby, Stills, and Nash. The deployment of cuss words is unfettered. One of Jonah Hills' previous performances was in ""The Wolf of Wall Street."" This could easily have been directed by Martin Scorsese. In fact, if you didn't know it wasn't, you might think it was. Perhaps it most closely resembles ""Casino"", with Jonah Hill in the Joe Pesci part -- the guy who just pushed a good thing too far. The structure also owes a lot to Scorsese's ""Goodfellows"", with Miles being taken up into illegal activities while explaining in the narration exactly how it works. One might call the movie ""The Wolf of Albania."" That's not bad. If you're going to steal from someone, steal from the best. And there are funny moments. Miles Teller and Jonah Hill are about to have an extremely important meeting with some US officials regarding a huge arms deal. The meeting will take place on the upper floor of a huge office building. They're nervous so they decide to get stoned before the tête-a-tête and they approach the meeting half wrecked. The duo walk down a long hall, their footsteps clicking loudly on the stone floor. Hill stops. ""Wait a minute. Does it sound to you like there are other people in this hall?"" Miles replies, ""Yes."" Okay, satisfied, they begin walking again.It may be imitation Scorsese but it's a good imitation. Brian De Palma's near constant imitation of Alfred Hitchcock became an irritation after a while, but as long as director Todd Phillips finds his own vision, sooner or later, I don't care. I enjoyed the hell out of it.",War Dogs,2005151
67,MLDinTN,another movie about crazy schemes to make money,6/10,11 April 2017,"This movie is supposedly based on a true story, I doubt much of what was in the movie was true. I'd say a lot of it was dramatized for entertainment. Basically it is about these 2 guys, Efraim (whom will cheat and lie for a buck) and David( whom seems somewhat honest). David joins Efraim's business which is buying military supplies and selling them to the US government. They go on an adventure to Jordan where they smuggle guns into Iraq and get chased by gun toting rebels. Then they have an opportunity to land a $300 million deal, only problem is the bullets they got can't be sold to the US. So Efraim schemes and of course it comes back to bite them in the #ss.FINAL VERDICT: I thought it was interesting, it's always fun when you have a movie in which people pull off crazy schemes that work for a while then they get in trouble. Check it out.

68,Svenstadt,Like a less intelligent 'Lord Of War',2/10,12 December 2019,"Much like 'American Made' and 'Atomic Blonde,' this also mismatches the cast and turns what should be a drama into an action film with the wrong feel to it. Miles Teller looks like a boy scout. The attempt at irony and juvenile sarcasm that was present in L.O.W. in a sort of narrative style of the very dry delivery of Nick Cage was poorly copied in this turd.

69,digdog-785-717538,a poor copy of Lord Of War,6/10,10 November 2016,"Shame on you if you have not watched that great film which is Lord Of War; go out immediately and watch it, and you will be able to see how War Dogs is the same story, but seem from the eyes of Vitaly (Nicholas Cage's brother in the film) instead of Yuri's.War Dogs is the story of David Packouz (Miles Teller) being dragged into the business of arms trading by his pal Efrahim Diveroli(the awful Jonah Hill); the film starts as comedy, with them being newbies, stumbling in their early steps and accomplishing a great feat through ingenuity and beginner's luck. Then, after the obligatory ""and then we got so rich"" montage, the film attempts to veer towards a more serious tone, where the already insufficient acting skills of both leads falls completely flat.In the end, when the film comes to its dark conclusion (with redundant ""we'll save the soul of Miles Teller, because he looks like a nice boy"" bit), it's evident these two cannot build a character to save their own life.Miles Teller should never be cast into anything but ""young adult"" roles; he does not have the depth, the nuance, to give his characters anything but awkwardness and incredulity. Jonah Hill should never be cast in anything that does not rotate around pee and poo jokes. Preferably, he should just not be cast.The only appeal of this film is the middle segments, where the two leads get to party way harder than what their age should allow, but as soon as the film tries to develop a story, you'll wish it was over. The ""family problems"" things are badly written and just out of place.I would not recommend War Dogs to anyone, regardless if they have seen the far superior Lord Of War or not; the film does not stand on it own, there are a few bits which are mildly amusing, but nothing you haven't seen before.A honest vote of 5.5/10 - could have been much better with decent actors.",War Dogs,2005151

But as the boys delve deeper into this murky world, the risks get greater and everything conspires to fall apart around them.When it comes to war, and the politics and motivations behind it, we're living in a far more cynical, acutely self aware age, where people are no longer falling for the jingoistic, stirring rhetoric used to whip up support for it, and can see beneath the surface of what it's about just fine. And so a different type of film emerges, in the shape of War Dogs, where our heroes aren't rounded, noble figures, but shady, arrogant ba$tards who are really operating behind the scenes. Sadly, despite the potential, the film isn't the soaring hit it should have been.Director Todd Phillips seems to have a background in mainstream comedy films, including The Hangover series, and while this is billed as a comedy itself, the darker tone and more uneasy subject matter make it harder to see in this way. Performances wise, Hill has never played his obnoxious American arsehole act to such great effect, making his Wolf of Wall Street character practically Paddington Bear, whilst Teller provides fine support as the slightly more restrained other guy. There is a neat sense of style, savvy Goodfellas style narration and some cool dramatic moments, but none of it comes off in quite as coherent and satisfying a manner as one would have hoped.If you want a film with a morally conflicted protagonist making a killing during war time, Lord of War with Nicolas Cage (which, ironically, was released in the year the film is set) is a more satisfying option. **",War Dogs,2005151
71,seshasai-tris,a well made war comedy,7/10,16 August 2016,"Todd Philips has done a fine job in creating a nice War Comedy. There haven't been many decent war comedies in the recent times.War dogs is about two young kids who exploit the not-so-good government initiative in becoming arms dealers, in the process getting greedy and in trouble. Based on a real life story of David Packouz and Efraim Diveroli, who won a $300 million contract from the Pentagon to arm America's allies in Afghanistan, the director has done a great job in converting a dry story into an entertaining movie.Jonah Hill keeps up the comedy of the film through out. Miles Teller, an under rated actor proves yet again that he can be a great actor in this one. Bradley Cooper's character is well crafted and is entertaining till the end. The supporting characters have done a decent job.This wouldn't be on top movies but sure is a fun watch in summer. my rating 7/10",War Dogs,2005151
72,Anurag-Shetty,"A hilarious comedy, that also has some superb dramatic moments.",9/10,22 August 2016,"War Dogs tells the true story of two men in their 20s named, Efraim Diveroli(Jonah Hill) & David Packouz(Miles Teller). Efraim & David realize that they can make easy money, by selling guns & other war equipment to the American military. Soon the two childhood friends make a name for themselves & land a major million dollar contract to sell different kinds of guns & ammunition to the military. However, things don't quite go according to plan. War Dogs is a fantastic film. This movie has many extremely funny scenes. The one-liners will crack you up. However, what really makes this film stand out from all the other adult comedies is that, it has a beautiful emotional core. This makes you care about all the main characters in the film. The dramatic moments in the movie, are as powerful as the comedic moments. The only flaw in this movie is that, it's not as funny as it could have been. The performances are the highlight of the film. Jonah Hill is spectacular as Efraim Diveroli. Hill continues to masterfully balance comedy & drama, after his role in The Wolf of Wall Street(2013). Miles Teller is outstanding as David Packouz. Teller brings an irresistible dry humor to his role. The chemistry between Hill & Teller is effortless. It really feels like they are childhood friends. Ana de Armas is awesome as Iz. Bradley Cooper is amazing in his small yet significant role, as Henry Girard. Shaun Toub is great as Marlboro. Director Todd Phillips has successfully made an adult comedy/drama, after two continuous sequels & four full fledged adult comedies. Kudos! War Dogs is a must watch. Go, laugh until your sides hurt.",War Dogs,2005151
73,rgkarim,War Meets Wolf of Wall street: Teller and Hill Take On Politics,8/10,19 August 2016,"Robbie K here, starting the weekend off with what elsea movie review. Tonight we jump into the political drama movie that is about our beloved country and those who try to cheat the system to make excessive amounts of cash. So lets bump past the formalities and dive right into my thoughts on War Dogs starring Jonah Hill and Miles Teller! LIKES:  Good chemistry between actors  Interesting story  Comedy is wittyWhen I saw the trailers for this movie, I shuddered to think of the mess this movie could potentially be. After all, both of the actors (while talented) had not been in any roles that I absolutely loved. Therefore I was nervous to see these cast together and the potential stupidity/annoyance that could have been. To my surprise, these two were great together, having a dynamic relationship that sold the characters to me. Hill's brash, aggressive nature led the charge of the movie, but was able to be toned down by Teller's calm, intelligent, and more mature role. Each one was able to balance the others extremes and certainly felt like two coworkers/friends cheating the system. Once more I say that alone these guys were good, but together they were excellent. While the relationship is certainly the driving force of the movie, the story helps keep the pace and suspense going. The story is exactly as sold in the trailers of two young men giving up their mundane jobs to begin selling weapons across the country. Unlike other gun running movies, this film abandons the frontlines for the bank, and feels much like another rendition of the Wolf of Wall Street. Todd Phillips and his team integrated the lives of our characters well into the story while still adding an edge of threat to keep you wondering what would interfere. The many moving pieces keep one engaged in the movie, and while there were components I felt under developed, had enough detail in each to bring things together. Finally the comedy, I was expecting the comedy to be nothing more than a bunch of one-liners and facial expressions to make the next wave of memes. Truth isthere are plenty of these moments, but surprisingly there is some rather witty dialogue that had me laughing. In particular the banter between the two held plenty of clever insults and jabs at American stereotypes. Hill's character in particular had more lines I found funny, mainly by his delivery, but Teller's responses to those lines also assisted with that factor. All-in-all, the comedy has all of the insult and stupidity you expect, but is delivered so well. DISLIKES:  Wanted more Ana De Armas moments  The F word and comedic antics getting old  Underdeveloped parts and the endingMy first dislike is the limitation of Ana De Armas' character. I won't lie, she is a beautiful woman and was very nice to have on screen (hey I am human after all). But I also really liked her character and how she drove the morals of the story despite all the corruption in this film. That goodness could have really refreshed the movie at some of the slower parts and they could have injected some more suspense in the film by having her in the film. Perhaps she isn't the most key character in this war/crime drama, but hey it couldn't have hurtI think. To sound like a broken record, the F word does not equal great dialogue or great writing. Yet Hollywood still can't get that idea through their skulls. War Dogs has moments where it is just one bomb dropped after another, which may not bother you much. Still this reviewer would love the strategic use of the word to maximize its comedy potential, instead of replaying the ploy much like a Hallmark Channel Christmas movie. The same can be said for the comedic ploys in this film, some of which are again beaten to death without much remorse. Jonah Hill's laugh (which sounded like a mixture between the joker and a donkey) in particular grew stale to me and was more annoying by the tenth time it escaped its lips. Fortunately, there aren't too many of these stale antics plaguing the riding. My final limitation was the underdeveloped components of the film. I've already stated the Ana De Armas parts, but there were other components I felt were in need of some fine tuning. The Bradley Cooper character I expected to have a bigger role for the price tag he carries and the way they snuck under the government's nose was a bit far-fetched as well. In addition, the fact that this is all based on a Rolling Stone article left me wondering how much was true and how much of this was Hollywood magic and fantasy. And as for the ending, it is a little lackluster and I would have thought more ploy, drama, and actual footage would have been in the film. Not to mention the final scene was ambiguous and unnecessary. The VERDICTWar Dogs was much better than I expected and really portrays the actions some may take to make a quick buck. While certainly not the most original or entertaining movie, the engaging characters will keep you entertained and the dialogue will have you laughing. However, these qualities are not enough to recommend a trip to the theater for most of the audience members. Only those with great capitalistic pride and who don't mind American political jabs should venture into this movie, otherwise wait for the Redbox rent. My scores:Comedy/Drama/War: 8.0 Movie Overall: 7.0",War Dogs,2005151
74,aciessi,This Gun Runs.,5/10,19 August 2016,"After three Hangover films, two progressively worse than the first, and after another shift in the popularity of comedy films, you'd think that we had seen the last of Todd Phillips. But here he returns with War Dogs, a film that doesn't include Tigers in bathrooms, Mike Tyson karaoke, or men over the age of 40 waking up the next morning wondering what the hell they did the night before. This time, it's guns, ammo, drugs, the Iraq War, The Bush administration, fraud, corruption, greed and a group of violent Albanian mobsters. This is no laughing matter. This is Phillips' first attempt at making a truly serious film, while supplying his familiar style of dark comedy. But when you factor in the freeze-frame shots, the narrations, the soundtrack of classic rock tunes, the violence and the drugs, this film is nothing short of a love letter to Martin Scorsese. I kid you not, that's what this film is. Roll your eyes all you want, but it's a style of filmmaking that always works, especially when you're making something based on a true story. Paul Thomas Anderson did it with Boogie Nights, David O. Russell did it with American Hustle, Adam McKay did it with The Big Short.. and so on, and so on. I'll never dislike a movie that attempts to emulate Scorsese, no matter how blatant it could be. War Dogs succeeds with this formula, up to a certain point. When it comes to the political angle that the film takes, it wants you to believe that it's smarter than it actually is. It takes it's aim at the military industrial complex under Bush, but with the rise of a non- interventionalist foreign policy embraced by both parties, thanks to Trump and Sanders, this kind of subject is hardly daring. You're preaching to the converted, Todd. We all know that the Iraq War sucked. The edge is simply not there, but the performances and the writing make up for it. Teller and Hill have tremendous chemistry. They make believable brothers. Jonah Hill in particular is mesmerizing, creepy and totally hilarious. If this was a much better picture, you'd probably be hearing a lot of award buzz surrounding his performance. I really enjoyed Bradley Cooper's interesting bad-guy character. In short, it's a fairly entertaining, fairly long, and not too bad time at the movies, but it doesn't break any new ground, and it's nothing to rave about.",War Dogs,2005151
75,DKosty123,Real Story That Might Anger Some Viewers With Shock & Awe,9/10,20 August 2016,"Ripped from the news, this movie is the story of 2 twenty-something guys who went into the arms peddling business in 2005 during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. It tells the story in the first person with Miles Teller (David Packouz) narrating it throughout. The film packs a lot of surprising things into it and is one of the better told true story tales spun on film this year.The writers who did the screen play were also writers on The Hangover and they know how to tell a story and make it into comedy. What is strange is how the truth can be funny and is most of the way through until the conclusion where things do get serious. It is spun here as a quite incredible story.The anger of some viewers might be in how inept the Military and W Bush administration are presented. W Bush does not come off looking great here by any stretch. Efraim (Jonah Hill) and David (Teller) do not appear to be very intelligent, and yet they manage to make a lot of money because of the system set up to provide weapons in the Middle East conflicts. When it is put together overall, Government waste in these wars is massive, and it appears that it was quite easy to make money on the US Government.Is there comedy? Yes, some of the situations are quite funny, and the narration is spot on in telling the story. There are no weak spots in the story, as this is story telling the way it should be done. It is easy to follow and does not get lost. There is one scene at the beginning which David is getting a gun to his head. Then the story goes back to the start and goes through everything logically. It does get back to the gun, though I think the first opening of the film is not needed but does attract the viewers attention.This is an important film which is very much worth going too. It is not a waste of time by any means.",War Dogs,2005151
76,Cem_Topuz,double henry,1/10,12 November 2016,"if War Dogs could be funny as it's trailer promises, it's rating could be seven...but not even close to two if you actually watch it.War Dogs is a constraining comedy movie with lots of clichés and has only one scene that's half action, half funny on it.the most wtf moment for me all through the movie is, the appearance of Jonah Hill. He looks like an obese, over tanned Bradley Cooper. Some one like, from the future or past of Bradley's character, seriously, when Teller's character meets with Bradley's character at the bar, for the first time, for a second, i waited something like: "" hey! i'm from the future! don't do this."" etc.any way, nothing exciting, funny or compelling here, move along.",War Dogs,2005151
77,Pramitheus,Boring to the point of putting you to sleep,5/10,24 December 2016,"I think the title sums it up. Jonah Hill's laugh is annoying as anything and so is this movie. Hell, I'd say it's worse than Jared Leto's ""attempt"" at the Joker laugh. Just like the laugh, the movie is a half-ass attempt at being as cool as Fight Club or Ocean's Eleven but all of it amounting to nothing other than being boring to the point of putting you to sleep.STORY & SCRIPT - The story is about two high-school friends who meet over a funeral after a long time. Miles Teller's character,David works as a masseuse and has an incredibly hot, Spanish girlfriend. You want logic here? Look away. As David can't make both ends meet Efron(Jonah Hill) offers a job in his company, so that he can support his family and also help Efron make the most out of the loop-holes in the American system. As this is based on a true story, I really can't say that which is more absurd, the plot or the story- telling. The script is woven over this plot, which sounds like a joke you tell at a party and everybody has a good laugh. But here, that joke is extended to a 2- hour long film full of phone-calls and talking and narration. There is so much narration that you will start thinking that why are they showing the film, just read the script and get it over with. DIRECTION - Now it is clear that Todd Phillips was indeed a one-time wonder with the Hangover. Maybe it was a stroke of luck or stroke of genius but it isn't working now. The levels of absurdity which was promised in the trailers are missing. Like I said, if you have to make a party-time joke into a movie, you better have the substance for it. The movie begins with a semi-dark-comedic tone and then it goes all dark and gloomy. This is in the first 40 minutes. The rest of the movie keeps going up and down regarding tone. It's all over the place. The characters aren't given time to build up. Few small, stereotypical, easily relatable situations and a truckload of narration. That's what the director used to establish the characters. On top of that, the movie suffers from the Suicide Squad syndrome. Songs everywhere. Just everywhere. There is a scene in the movie where three things are happening simultaneously:narration, characters talking and music playing. It was just horrible.ACTING - Other than Bradley Cooper's small role as a shady agent, everyone was what they are. Miles Teller was Miles Teller. There was no actual room for character building because of the exposition and narration by his character. Jonah Hill is awful. Either he is shouting too loud or he is laughing. I hate that laugh. If it was intentional, good job, Jonah because it really took me out of the movie.FINAL VERDICT - Give it a pass. It does boast of two of the youngest and finest actors right now in Hollywood but watch it if you want to know how stupid the American Defence system is. I mean, that's the only takeaway from this. You won't remember the characters, nor the story. Yes, you'll remember that laugh.",War Dogs,2005151
78,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,6/10,14 November 2016,"War DogsThe worst thing about war profiteering is that the ghosts of your victims haunt your money.Luckily, possessed Benjamins don't deter the amoral marketers in this dramedy.Following a string of dead-end jobs, David Packouz (Miles Teller) decides to take his old high school buddy Efraim Diveroli (Jonah Hill) up on his offer to help him sell small shipments of firearms to the US war effort in Iraq.But when the deals start getting dangerous, then downright illegal, David's conscience and pregnant wife (Ana de Armas) start to influence his decisions.A highly fictionalized adaptation of an investigative article later elongated into a bestseller, War Dogs embraces its dramatized narrative for the sake of light entertainment. And while the leads do work while together, their puerile antics slight the gravity of the film's context.

79,DarkVulcan29,I couldn't take much in.,5/10,14 September 2016,"Is this film boring, well no. Although based on a true story, I've come to realize that most of what I saw here is half creative license, in movies based on true stories I've come expect that. I've felt the trailer was very misleading, making it appear to be an action buddy misadventure, when in fact it was none of that. I believe it was only loosely based on a real events.Jonah Hill and Miles Teller are both wonderful actors, and they both put in effort here. But neither one really click, I think the filmmakers where trying to give them a Newman and Redford like feel, but Hill and Teller don't have the right chemistry do give us that, It just didn't sell to me that they where best friends. The actress who plays Tellers girlfriend is okay, but just goes nowhere, and never really convinces me that Teller is truly in love with her. And when the film throws in humor, It gives off that it was trying too hard. Bradley Cooper is in it too, and does alright with his small role he plays. The film is not all bad, the scenery is pretty good, and the country scenes are effective.In the end the film did not do much for me.",War Dogs,2005151
80,Screen_Blitz,True story-based comedy is only half as smart and funny as it should be,5/10,13 December 2016,"Todd Phillips, the director and writer behind the successful 'Hangover' trilogy along with a string of less memorable comedies, is one of the last people you would expect to tackle on more serious subject matter like international arms dealing. Though Phillips doesn't abandon the comedic territory, this film marks a slightly different direction than his typical repertoire; a film that taps into the political satire of war, arms dealing, and the fateful consequences that ensue. The main problem with this however, is that Todd Phillips seems lost in balancing his translating of the inspiring true story and mix of raunchy and dark, cynical humor. By the end of its 114 minutes, it all transpires to a half-baked comedy that barely succeeds to generate good laughs while struggling to make a crucial point about the repercussions of international arms dealing.So this film follows the true story of David Packouz (played by Miles Teller) and Efraim Diveroli (played by Jonah Hill), two Miami natives who reunite as friends after many years of no see. Upon their reunion, David learns about Efraim making millions of dollars from illegally selling firearms online to the Afghan military during the height of the Iraq War. David reluctantly joins in on this and together these friends began making a fortune off of capitalizing on illegal arms sales under a fraudulent contract. In the process, they come face-to-face with some shady figures including an expert arms dealer Henry Girard (played by Bradley Cooper).Todd Phillips attempts to drive this rags-to-riches story in the same wheelhouse as last year's 'The Big Short' which tackled on the financial crisis of 2008 while incorporating an exhilarating mix of humor and potency. Adam McKay however, conducted his subject matter fairly more superior than Todd Phillips does with the true story about two unlikeliest of illegal gun runners. As exhibited in 'Lord of War' starring Nicolas Cage and Jared Leto, illegal arms dealing is a dangerous game; one wrong move is all it takes for everything go south. Phillips has the potential to flourishing a story of full of substance if not without some good laughs to provide a side of levity. Unfortunately, the film not only fails sketch out an effective political satire of its subject material but fails to dig deep into the politics behind international arms or the consequences behind the shady business. Phillips delivers a rather uninteresting approach the real-life tale in a way that deprives from the dynamics of the arms dealing industry including the political controversy triggered by the government spending millions of dollars on fraudulent contracts since 2003 when the U.S launched an invasion in Iraq. Beyond a pinch of social commentary on the Bush Administration and the established greed and corruption of the lead characters, the film barely reaches any dynamic heights.For a film dealing with the corruption and ill morality of arms business, Todd Phillips at least does a fine job on establishing a comedic field along with the chemistry between leads Miles Teller and Jonah Hill. Though a good portion of the jokes are bit hit-and-miss and their level of humor never elevates to the standards of the typical Todd Phillips fare, these likable leads foster almost enough laughs to make up for its faulty script. In comparison to the ""Wolfpack"" in the 'Hangover' trilogy, the characters do not indulge in the same type of raunchy R-rated vulgarity, largely in favor for a slightly more cynical tale than an average comedic farce. Miles Teller, as charismatic as an actor he is, boasts a likable portrayal of the reluctant David Packouz who gets involved with his buddy Emrail Diveroli's immoral schemes. Diveroli himself is granted by a fine comedic performance by the ever-charming Jonah Hill who bears a solid barrage of bold-mouth vulgar one-liners and political bashing commentary against the Iraq War. Cuban actress Ana De Armas delivers a fine portrayal as David's worried wife who grows hungry for info on the nasty schemes her husband getting involved in, but perhaps isn't given a whole to do, nor is the 'Hangover' star Bradley Cooper as the shady arms dealer who the duo must face when they make an ill-adviced contract deal.War Dogs is a middling rags-to-riches comedy that may generate some laughs to please moviegoers pursuing for an engaging comedic experience, but suffers from Todd Phillips's trite execution on its true story-inspired. Though this film definitely does make for a pain-no-gain experience, the overall results fail to measure up to anything memorable or even clever.",War Dogs,2005151
81,bryank-04844,Don't go to war over 'War Dogs'!,5/10,23 January 2017,"'War Dogs' looks good on paper and the trailer for the film sells the movie's comedy and fun moments. It seemed like the perfect project for director Todd Phillips ('The Hangover' trilogy, 'Road Trip', 'Old School') as he reunites with Bradley Cooper and adds Jonah Hill and Miles Teller to this story, based on true events about two school friends who love to smoke up and run guns for the government – some of which might be illegal. This is a very different film for Phillips from what we're used to, and unlike the trailer, the film isn't all that funny. Sure, there are some moments of small laughter here and there, due to Jonah Hill's character, but the rest is Phillips' wink to a mix of gangster movies, including 'Scarface', 'Goodfellas', 'Casino', and even a bit of 'Drive'.That sounds good on paper, but the end result was lackluster with the 115 minute movie seeming like a three hour endeavor. The pacing is off and one scene just seems to be a repetition of the one before it. 'War Dogs' tells the true story of Efraim Diveroli and David Packouz, who were high school friends, who eventually got a government contract to supply weapons to the U.S. Army in Afghanistan with no prior experience and being in their early 20s. This film of course has a bunch of fictionalized elements, which is good, but never has anything original or fresh.Perhaps the best scene of the film is in the trailer, where Diveroli (Jonah Hill) and Packouz (Miles Teller) are riding in the truck in the Iraq desert, being chased by people with guns. That scene was funny, action-packed, and highly entertaining. Unfortunately the rest of the film is fairly drab with some flashes of funny Jonah Hill moments. Phillips sure packed the film with winks and nods to the gangster movies I mentioned above with the same music, shots, and narration style that you see in Scorsese films. Plus, there are 'Scarface' posters everywhere in the film, along with references to the actual movie by name. I just got tiresome very fast.It's an interesting enough story to tell, but the characters aren't that redeeming nor are they that likable throughout, particularly Jonah Hill's character, who he plays the part perfectly. Teller is also great, but isn't given much to work with. Bradley Cooper shows up for a few seconds here and there, but again, isn't given much time to really explore his character, who turns out to be the most interesting part of the movie. 'War Dogs' looks good from a technical and visual standpoint, but there really isn't anything underneath that veil.WAIT FOR NETFLIX!",War Dogs,2005151
82,paul-allaer,Funny movie about a serious topic,6/10,28 August 2016,"""War Dogs"" (2016 release; 114 min.) is ""based on true events"" we are reminded as the film opens. We are in January, 2008"", when we see a guy, Dave Packouz, thrown out of a car and assaulted by what look to be kidnappers. When then move back to ""Miami Beach 2005"", as we see Dave struggle to make end meets as a licensed massage therapist. Then one day at a funeral, Dave runs into his old buddy Efraim Diveroli, who has recently moved back to Miami. Efraim, a small time arms dealer, can use Dave's help with the arms bonanza that is the war in Iraq. Before we know it, the two are starting to sell arms to the Pentagon. At this point we're 15-20 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this movie, based on a Rolling Stone Magazine article, is directed by Todd ""The Hangover"" Phillips and equally as important, produced by Bradley Cooper's production company (Cooper himself also plays a small role as another shady arms dealer). The movie is divided up in 7 or 8 chapters (I didn't count them exactly) such as ""All money is made between the lines"", and ""When does telling the truth help anyone?"". Miles Teller (from ""Whiplash"") and Jonah Hill are David and Efraim, respectively. Teller looks so young! Hill on the other hand seems he was made to play this role. The movie is billed as a comedy, and yes there are quite a few laughs to be had, as the absurdity of the situation lends itself to easy laughs, There should've been a serous undercurrent as well, about the flood gates opened by the Bush administration to fill billions of dollars in war procurement, enticing second and third tier companies and scammers to get a piece of the pie. (A recent book called Consequence by Eric Fair goes into that aspect as well, and it is not a comedy). last but not least, there is a smorgasboard of music placed throughout the movie, from CCR's Fortunate Son to the Who's Behind Blue Eyes. to Leonard Cohen's Everybody Knows (playing over the end credits).""War Dogs"" is now into its second week, and it did okay at the box office in the first week. The Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended okay, not poor, not great. I heard a lot of chuckles throughout the movie, so that was a good sign. Bottom line"" ""War Dogs"" is a funny movie with some great performances but lacks the seriousness to be a heavy hitter.",War Dogs,2005151
83,Amari-Sali,"When you're in your 20s and the reality of adulthood hits hard, easy money is tempting. So why not get into arms dealing with a friend?",6/10,20 August 2016,"Trigger Warning(s): IslamophobiaCharacters Worth Noting David (Miles Teller) | Efraim (Jonah Hill) | Iz (Ana de Armas)Main Storyline22-year-old David is living with a cute girlfriend, who he recently got pregnant, is a college dropout, failed entrepreneur, and his sole steady paycheck is rubbing the bodies of older men. Men who like to tease him a little bit. As you can imagine, he is frustrated with how his life has turned out. That is, until Efraim, his friend from when he was a kid, pops up at a mutual acquaintance's funeral and they hang out. Efraim shows off this grandeur lifestyle and of course, David wants in. He has a kid on the way, wants to do right by his girlfriend Iz, and doesn't want to struggle. No, he'd rather trade in his morals in order to obtain the mighty dollar. Hell, even to benefit Iz and his child, he'd lie to her if he had to, and he does.Thing is, when you have two young men with a huge amount of ambition, willing to fib or outright lie to get ahead, it has to catch up with them eventually right?HighlightsHill has mastered crafting someone you love to hate. Efraim, no matter what aspect of his personality or business side, is someone you can't inherently stand. He is a professional con artist with a polarizing laugh which will either crack you up or annoy the hell out of you. On top of that, he is a pro at being selfish. He will adapt to the minimum required to get what he wants out of you, and then play you for a fool. Reminding you that despite some really odd and questionable films in Hill's filmography, he has been in the game for over a decade and certainly has learned a thing or two.Low PointsPerhaps the main problem of this film is that on top of the trailer giving away most of the best parts of the movie, the trailer sells you an action comedy. Making it so when Teller is left to present, mostly on his own, the film's dramatic elements, he almost seems like a liability. For with Hill, being his usual comical self, like a borderline caricature of what supposedly is a real person, it makes David's issues that Teller is trying to portray feel unwelcomed.David is trying to make money for his family and Efraim is trying to get his full hour with a prostitute. David is trying to be a good father and boyfriend, and Efraim is flipping out because someone corrects him in a meeting about IBM just being a random set of letters. I mean, the straight man and the fool works in a lot of movies, but it doesn't here. For on top of Teller trying to bring you the drama, and not doing so well at that, you are left wondering why this story, in particular, was important to tell? What makes two kids, barely old enough to drink, worth making a movie about? That question is never really answered.Going back to the topic of Teller in this film, as I wrote this review, I was questioning that with how much Hill gets to eclipse Teller in this film, could it be Teller has lost his luster? Maybe that charm and possible IT factor wasn't all him? Could it be that with his co-star in Whiplash being a supporting role challenging him or his past love interest focused complimenting his character, could that have been it? Could it be that when someone isn't cast to support or compliment his character, but rather just make their character the one remembered after the credits roll, is Teller no longer the type of lead I, admittedly, took him for?Either way, be it the movie selling one thing and you buying another, Hill and Teller's having unbalanced chemistry, or simply Teller bearing all the weight of bringing a dramatic element to this film, even if this film is ""Based on a True Story,"" you never get why this one, in particular, was an important one to tell.",War Dogs,2005151
84,cruise01,"Guns, guns, and a dud.",6/10,22 December 2016,"War Dogs is a film that is based on a true story about two friends that run an arms dealer business and selling their weapons to contractors/ to the pentagon. There is nothing on a film that is trying to adapt a real story onto film. Todd Phillips direction tries to make the film fun and some humor from the two leads like Miles Teller and Jonah Hill. Phillips previous work like Due Date and The Hangover films is still better with the jokes and humor. War Dogs is a fair comedy drama film, while playing into a serious direction just cause these events happen. And when a character is in uncomfortable territory in a country and he is just a regular message therapist, trying to make a living. The plot takes place in 2005, David (Miles Teller) a message therapist that is trying to make a living, and now then pregnant girlfriend played by Ana de Armas. David meets up with a long lost high school buddy Efraim (Jonah Hill) and is introduced in his business of arms dealing. Even though, David's girlfriend disapprove of guns, and becomes distant when his lies and secrets about this job increases. David and Efraim go way over by meeting Henry (Bradley Cooper). A guy that has connections to dealers with plenty of supplies.Miles Teller and Jonah Hill are both humorous and fun actors. The film does have its dark humor and a decent amount of laughs. Feels like the film takes into a serious turn when lives are threatened and people get kidnapped. A reminder that their arms dealing business is far from being a walk in the park job. And when they have to keep up with hiding evidence that can spark them into getting trouble with the law. Basically, the film does have that feel like another arms dealing movie such as Lord of War. And lets thrown in the idea of a true story and mixing with jokes in it just like how Pain and Gain turned out. Thats one main issue the film struggles is trying to keep a coherent direction and balance between the drama and its dark humor. Only if the script made these characters just as interesting and kept up with the pacing into making a better film. Even when the characters use pop references like the Scarface film and others, etc. War Dogs is a decent dramedy of a movie, the cast can do so much to make the movie entertaining. But for the dull script, and a coherent direction. The film would be one of those forgettable comedy movies.",War Dogs,2005151
85,RforFilm,War Dogs has some shiny weapons and story: it needed more ammunition to fire off,6/10,22 August 2016,"Funding the military is expensive. We have bases all over the world, each with facilities and housing for those solders. Each solider (over a million of them) is carrying thousands of dollars worth of equipment and weaponry. I bring this up because war may be a travesty, but it's a business opportunity itself. Several companies are out and about to generate the best material for the armed forces to use, and to do so in an inexpensive way. While I doubt I could ever get into that business (personal morals would prevent me), I can see why gunrunning would seem attractive to those that want the high life. The subjects within War Dogs are gunrunners, but they're also very young. Their college aged, which would make their maturity a big question. The good news is that if your smart enough, then age doesn't matter. What matter's is how well your know your clientele and the best manner to negotiate with. The early 2000's was a period of two wars; the War on Terror in the Middle East and the Invasion of Iraq. Both would obviously require some ammunition. Let's see how the real life subjects handled these ends in War Dogs. Starting off in 2005 in Miami, David Packouz (played by Miles Teller) is a guy with little direction. He dropped out of college, has failed in a business selling sheets to retirement homes, and makes a small living as a massage therapist. While attending a funeral for a friend, he spots his middle school buddy Efraim Diveroli (played by Jonah Hill). The two meet up where we find out that the two did bad things in their youth and Efraim's parents sent him away to work with his uncle's arms business. Efraim has now returned and tells David about his new business venturethe war.Despite not agreeing with the war, David comes on board when his girlfriend Iz becomes pregnant. Efraim shows him how they acquire these contracts: the Pentagon has a website a lot like a job search site where they have thousands of listings for businesses to put a bid into. They manage to acquire contracts from Bagdad to Albania where they stay true to their word and become millionaires overnight. As Efriam's company gets bigger, his greed grows (along with a drug addiction) and tensions rise when David is forced to live in Albania to secure a 30 million deal with a terrorist watch list candidate Henry Girard (played by Bradley Cooper).The idea of irresponsible people getting into a shady business and rising in that world is nothing new. Scarface did this (and is referenced several times. The Wolf of Wall Street, The Lord of War and Pain & Gain did this. What does War Dogs have to offer that's new? The movie brings these two guys who are played well by Jonah Hill and Miles Teller. The movie shows that these guys would be smart enough to pull off these government deals by day while going to Miami nightclubs at night. War Dogs is a nice looking movie. Director Todd Phillips (The Hangover trilogy) has a way of shooting his comedies like thrillers. A lot of that has to do with how he uses lighting. His colorful shooting of Miami becomes brighter once we arrive in the bleaker and grayer Albania. For his first mature story, Todd Phillips found a good blend of political problems, comedy, and some surprising thrills. What's lacking is a closer study at the relationship between these two. With what could have been a dramatic look into these two young men is more of a party. At least what they say can be interesting at times.I'll give this six machine guns out of ten. I can't say that War Dogs is an intelligent insight into how the government acquires its weaponry, but its still an entertaining look at some smart individuals. This needed a Martin Scorsese like director to really help this take off. I can still have fun with this.",War Dogs,2005151

87,rafael_jaramillo_avellan,"Maybe not the best Dramedy Biopic, but undeniably an entertaining one.",7/10,11 September 2016,"Not the best film of the year and neither bringing anything new to the Biopic/Drama/comedy genre, but amazingly entertaining with characters that you can identify with, and lots of quotable one-liners. I definitely believe Jonah Hill's performance is going to be nominated for the Golden Globes for Best Comedic Performance. Efraim's unique laugh is practically another character; it's like the role was made for him. Besides Jonah Hill's performance, Miles Teller doesn't get behind. Both actors have great chemistry between them, making the movie an enjoyable ride. Another thing that I loved was the soundtrack; for real, excellent song choices. Young viewers will find themselves wanting to be this couple of youngsters running for the millionaire contracts, strict viewers may not find anything plausible, but I'm pretty sure they will at least laugh a few times.FINAL CONSENSUS: Committed performances and entertaining moments help to elevate this mild treatment about concerning real life stories.",War Dogs,2005151
88,PyroSikTh,"Not a Comedy, but Still Entertaining",7/10,31 August 2016,"War Dogs follows two young stoners as they weasel their way into the arms business and somehow manage to land a $300million military contract with the government, supplying guns, grenades, and ammunition to the Afghan army circa 2008. They find they have to cut a few corners and forge a few documents to make sure it all runs smoothly, which it does, until it doesn't. Based on a true story, a lot of the broader strokes are public record, but being a movie, certain events have naturally been added or embellished to make them a little more interesting (no-one wants to watch two stoners sat in front of their computers for two hours).First thing I have to note is that the marketing lies. It lies really hard in order to get your seat in the cinema. The way it does that is by painting a different movie to what you get. In some ways it's understandably easier to market this film as a comedy, especially when you emblazon Todd Phillips' and Jonah Hill's names all over it. There are light-hearted moments and the odd joke, but almost every humorous moment is packed into the trailers. War Dogs is a drama/thriller first. This isn't a criticism, I'm just trying to manage expectations. Don't go in expecting The Hangover with arms dealers, because that's not this movie.That said, War Dogs plays a lot like Wolf of Wall Street meets Lord of War (the latter of which the real Efraim Diveroli was apparently obsessed with at the time). Jonah Hill pretty much plays the same character he did in Wolf of Wall Street as well. War Dogs plays out as a fundamentally anti- war/anti-military movie though. That's the only message you can really take from it as it highlights how ridiculous the whole situation is. These are two stoner kids running Barettas through Iraq, to be greeted with stacks of Hussain's billions just sitting in a warehouse, paying for the US invasion. When they inevitably get busted for fraud, David Packouz suffers only seven months of house arrest, which is nothing. A patsy he may have been, but it hardly put a dent in his life considering how serious his crimes were, and that's because the military was willing to turn a blind eye to the Chinese ammunition they were being sold, because it fuelled their war for a discount price.Jonah Hill and Miles Teller are pretty great though, even if they do just play to their typecasts. As I mentioned, Jonah Hill pretty much plays the same love-to-hate character he did in Wolf of Wall Street, only fatter, and ever so slightly more of a douchebag. He does it well though. Alarmingly well. His weight and his high-pitched laugh are used to comedic effect (if that's the kind of thing that amuses you, the group of lads sat behind me sniggered every time Hill laughed), and in a way to mock the real Diveroli, but largely holds no factual accuracy (Diveroli is actually quite well-built). Miles Teller plays his everyman out-of-depth character really well as well, with a beautiful young wife and baby daughter on the way providing him a motivation for getting into the business in the first place. Teller's Packouz is our character to root for, painted likable if slightly inept. Ultimately though, it all works because Teller and Hill share a fantastic chemistry that is both engaging and entertaining.War Dogs isn't a must-see movie by any stretch of the imagination. It's not particularly original, it's marketing was a massive misfire, and his underlying message is a little haphazard. That said I can't say I found myself bored at any point in the film's runtime. The acting and character work was done really well, and the story balanced out it's serious moments with light-hearted humour just enough without bowing into full-comedy mode. I give War Dogs a respectable 7/10",War Dogs,2005151
89,jordondave-28085,"Poor direction... overacting this is no ""Falcon and the Snowman""""",4/10,2 February 2023,"Based on actual fact, co-written, co-produced and directed by Todd Phillips directing somewhat of an altered version about 2 young men of David Packouz (Miles Teller) and Efraim Diveroli (Jonah Hill) illegal arms dealings with other countries. As the movie transitioned when David was having some hard times reuniting with childhood friend Efraim allowing him to manipulate him to be involve in this illegal arms deal scheme. One of the main problems I have is the casting of Jonah Hill who does way too much overacting, just watching him sometimes appear like loud mouth who is craving for attention, and that to me is not acting. Portraying one guy as the person who is just going along it does not appear to be an actual portrayal if one were to watch the actual doc it was based on or if i were to read the articles. Watch ""The Falcon And the Snowman"" starring Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn instead.

90,fillerruth,Hard to believe but as a comedy it may be successful,5/10,16 August 2016,"'War dogs' is one of the most anticipated movies of this summer. When I saw the trailer it felt to me that there is so much fun and it will be a good entertainer movie. Casting is also good. Jonah Hill is a good actor but is a very good comedian and Miles teller is a promising actor. It is a ""based on true story"" film so My expectation was huge and as a comedy movie it is good and the story pick up is fair. The title of the film tells you nothing but maybe this is a metaphor.I am not telling this is only a comedy and fun film. The story is very serious and there are good crude and real incident humor are in this movie. So if anyone is searching the seriousness of that issue it will be good. This is the story of two young men, David Packouz and Efraim Diveroli. They won a contract of 300 million from the Pentagon to arm America's allies in Afghanistan. It is a very funny story and the script makes this more interesting. There are lots of real incidents with good political humor and good double meaning dialogues. These double meaning dialogues will make you laugh and the political drama will make you thinking the real reason of the arms dealing. Jonah Hill and Miles Teller has done a very good job and the background score is a perfect matching. The story is good and fresh with good humor. the direction could have been better but not bad. The only negative point is movie's pace. Very slow pace movie and sometimes I felt the continuity is not built well. The story-telling style is also another negative point. It could have been better. Otherwise, it is a good movie. The story writer could have made this more believable but after all I will say it is a good choice for fun lover.",War Dogs,2005151
91,evpier,Rated #8. Really???,2/10,13 May 2017,"I guess it's a good indication of our society's current status when you have this movie (which isn't't worth a 2nd watch) ranked higher than Saving Private Ryan, Braveheart, Apocalypse Now, Platoon & Full Metal Jacket in the war category. It's comical that this one is even in the top 100. Its not a terrible movie, but I have no interest in seeing it twice (unlike the aforementioned that I'll watch every time I see them on the channel guide). There must be a lot of kids that like Jonah Hill voting on here. That can be the only explanation.

92,jaysanchu07,Amused by Jonah Hill & The Scarface Tributes,7/10,17 September 2022,"War Dogs is a semi-comedy film that tackles arms dealing & how two ragtags takes advantage of the silliness in the US government's procurement system. With its premise, the film happily delivers entertainment through the absurdity of its characters & awry situations when heavy hitters come into play.Todd Philipps and Jonah Hill deserves tons of credit for the film's positive appeal. Despite the seriousness of the subject, Philipps asserts his brand of delightful viewing through cleverly presented expositions & zany humor. The film's transition to deadly & threatening was pleasing and flawless, testament to terrific writing. Known for the Hangover Trilogy, Philipps also asserts his preference of comical and over the top characters, fascinatingly conveyed by one Jonah Hill.Jonah's Efraim Diveroli carries the comedy & conflict of the film. His loathsome, larger than life characterization was compelling, right down to his self inspired demonic chuckle. He is as well a character study of sorts, projecting distrust due to his untrustworthy qualities.Overall, War Dogs shares a striking commentary about the sorry state of wartime America, through a fitfully comic, American hustle storyline. It entertains though the wackiness of its characters & thrills when it turns its head to serious matters. It features as well, an outstanding Jonah Hill portrayal in case you need convincing. Rating: 7.5/10. A high rating could've been given, if not the for the universally staple, overused domestic woes subplot of Miles Teller's David & Ana De Arma's Iz.",War Dogs,2005151
93,ksf-2,anything to earn a buck.,7/10,30 April 2022,"Apparently VERY loosely based on actual events. Teller and hill play old childhood friends packouz and diveroli, who grew up together. And got arrested together. And now go into business reselling small arms contracts to the U. S. military. Although now they are dealing with some scary people. And not always telling the truth. Which is probably going to get them in trouble. After the small deals, they decide to chase the bigger deals. And they fudge the paperwork. Diveroli is doing drugs. This can't end well. Packouz knows this, but diveroli hasn't figured it out yet. Small role for brad cooper. It's pretty good. No surprises. Directed by todd philips, who has been nominated for four oscars for his films.

94,stevendbeard,Interesting,6/10,28 August 2016,"I saw ""War Dogs"", starring Jonah Hill-The 21 Jump Street movies, Django Unchained; Miles Teller-The Divergent movies, Footloose_2011; Ana De Armas-Hands of Stone, Exposed; Kevin Pollak-Angel From Hell_tv, End of Days and Bradley Cooper-Joy, All About Steve.This movie is based on a true story about 2 young men-in their earlier 20's-living in Miami Beach, that sold guns & ammo to the American Allies in Afghanistan in the 1980's. Jonah and Miles play the 2 childhood friends that get into the fascinating world of gun running. They started small and worked their way up to a $300 million contract with the U.S. government. Ana plays Miles wife. FYI: the real life person that Miles is portraying makes a cameo appearance in the movie as the guitar player in the old folks home that is singing, 'Don't Fear the Reaper' by BOC. Kevin plays a small businessman that backs the boys-financially-on some of their deals in return for a cut. Bradley plays another arms dealer that does business with Jonah & Miles. Bradley is on a 'Watch' list, so he can't do business with the government himself. Some parts of the movie are interesting, some are predictable. There are lots of recognizable music in the soundtrack; I remember hearing songs by Vanilla Fudge, Aerosmith, The James Gang, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Wolfmother and The Who. It's rated ""R"" for language, drug use and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 54 minutes.

95,scottshak_111,Witty and zesty at the same time unscrupulous,7/10,13 September 2016,"War Dogs is a crime biopic made thoroughly exciting by its cast. I have always enjoyed watching a Todd Phillips movie. It doesn't rip you apart with humour alone but also thrives on a great theme throughout, primarily with a story that makes every bit delectable. The bottom-line is that there is always something to look up to in his frames, and that makes the imminent, full of promises.War Dogs is no different. The biopic though fictionalized beyond limit to scooch in theatrics, comes out as an enjoyable piece that shatters doors of gravitas to bring that smile to your face. What work for the movie are hands down mind-boggling performances by its duo, and its uncanny witty theme. Where at one hand, Jonah Hill makes his character one of the most cherishable ones ever, Miles Teller cannot certainly be overlooked either with his riveting gazing mien that brings profundity to the cinema. Both of them, with their dynamic chemistry together, make War Dogs a fun yet intriguing watch.PLOT OF WAR DOGS The plot is basically an intensified theatrical look into the lives of Efraim Diveroli and David Packouz. With David joining his high school friend Efraim in his pursuit to supply arms and ammunition to the US army, the movie gets into the fine detailing of how their jobs were pulled off. It is a sheer mockery of the then existent feeble policies of US that saw opportunists getting their hands warm in the Iraq and Afghanistan fire.War Dogs begins with a brilliant diegetic tone from David's perspective, and delves into the story of David's life even before he meets Efraim. It is divided into various chapters with lines of crises from its own screenplay for chapter names. Each section gives away what is about to happen which isn't actually the best way of storytelling to be honest. It takes out that element of surprise of what's coming from it. But you have to give it to Todd for his creativity to weave Guy Lawson's Rolling Stone article ""Arms and the Dudes"" into something tangible.At one point when you almost begin to think, if War Dogs is just meant to caper all along on its fun theme, the movie proves you wrong almost instantly. You see it enter deeper waters. Drama becomes impactful and you realize all that hourly fun of awesomeness is heading straight for the deep muck they had signed their checks for. Dramatics come galloping then and it levels the movie with its theatrics giving it a perspective and a direction.DOWNSIDES OF WAR DOGS (SPOILERS INCLUSIVE) If you stare hard at the downsides of War Dogs you will see how much of the detailing have actually been overlooked. To show you what you wish to see, a lot of the backdrop is made to disappear in your subconsciousness. A city in despair doesn't feel like it when you visit it through Todd's fun frames. There is no real tension you perceive. It wasn't intended to get serious at any point, I surmise.Also, you can say the same by looking at the character Iz played by Ana de Armas. Tension is not allowed to transpire at all. She ends up becoming nothing but a nagging wife.War Dogs also elongates the Iraq visit too much, creating dispensable humour for one Dick Cheney's America scene, which seemed quite unnecessary. It feels like Todd might have had some extra time frames to cover or might have ran out of substance. So, he creates something that actually didn't happen.I really wished a profound character came along to show the perpetrators what they were actually dealing with. Why war is not what they think what it is. The gravity of working with elements of chaos as if they were playthings of a child; I think it was important to show them the misery they were offering.They get a poetic justice in the end, which was nicely wrapped up. A surprise visit by Henry Girard played by Bradley Cooper, who prefers wearing sunglasses, felt justified on the levels of David's morality. But when the question is posed about Bashkim's whereabouts, Henry shuts him with money, thus leaving all his threads out in the open.CELEBRATING CRIME At the end of it all, you have to understand, both Efraim Diveroli and David Packouz were really bad men. The way the movie gets manifested is as if what the actors were doing was a good thing. A context that its direction feeds you, and it is sad that something rogue and out of line like that gets celebrated.You can't help but notice how the movie only plays out on the vantage of David Packouz's perspective. It puts him in the spotlight as a person who had a conscience whilst slaying Efraim's brazen demeanour altogether. At what point in the movie does Efraim ever realize what he did was wrong? Well, never! Oh and whatever happens, don't ask Efraim the full form of AEY. Watch out for that bit! THE FINAL VERDICT It is hard not to compare War Dogs with the likes of Lord of War. What Andrew Niccol had created was undoubtedly and effortlessly smart, something you see War Dogs struggling with at numerous points. But it still manages to rope you in with Miles Teller's rapt eyes and Jonah Hill's engaging performance despite the theme movie tries to cash in on. Despite, how good the movie turns out to be it still remains unscrupulous nevertheless.What you would definitely take from this movie would be Jonah's signature laugh; no doubt about that.",War Dogs,2005151
