0,SnoopyStyle,good with a couple of problems,7/10,5 June 2016,"En Sabah Nur is Apocalypse, the first mutant who ruled ancient Egypt until he was entombed. It's the 80's. CIA agent Moira MacTaggert goes to Egypt and witnesses his emergence. He recruits his four horsemen Magneto, Storm, Psylocke, and Angel giving them greater power. Meanwhile, Raven recruits Kurt Wagner/Nightcrawler from an East Berlin fight club. Alex Summers brings his younger brother Scott to Professor Charles Xavier's school. Quicksilver arrives at the school just in time to rescue almost everybody from an explosion but Professor X is kidnapped by Apocalypse.I really like the first half. There are some good introduction of the new characters. It's working fine for the most part. It hits the pinnacle with Quicksilver's rescue which is funny and exciting. It is visually dynamic and a joy to behold. The rest of the movie feels like a long slow slide into mediocrity.The most troubling problem for the continuing franchise is the use of Mystique as the leading X-Men. That character has never been in that role. JLaw is struggling to put out the intensity to match the central part. She and her character is not up to the task so far. It's also funny that her powers is to not be JLaw. The other problem is Apocalypse. I hoped for better but his mega-destruction is underwhelming. It's a lot of bland and his powers are nebulous. I actually think it would have been better to allow Apocalypse to be a two-parter. As an one-and-done villain, he isn't allowed to be anything more than a monster of the moment. With a lower level of power from him, it could be more compelling to struggle for the soul of each horseman. As it stands, the character Apocalypse is nothing special.",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516
1,KineticSeoul,"The weakest in the trilogy, but not bad.",7/10,6 June 2016,"Maybe it's because I had a bigger expectation for this film, but it was aiight. In the movie there is a scene where mutant students come out of the theater after watching ""Return of the Jedi"". And says something along the lines of the third installment being the worst. And that basically applies to this film, because in my opinion it's the weakest compared to the previous two X-Men movies. It's in no way a bad movie, but it just wasn't anything all that amazing either. Because the editing and progression of the story just wasn't all that compelling or interesting. Watching this movie was like watching ""Rocky 4"", it's alright but just not good as ""Rocky"" and ""Rocky 2"". The plot is basically about Apocalypse getting resurrected, finding his four horsemen while the new group of students get recruited into Xavier Institute. With it focusing in on Magneto the most next to Apocalypse with his side story and what makes him tick. It really did show how how much of a human character Magneto really is. I mean even the kindest people out there has a breaking point when you push them to their limit. I guess the human side of Magneto and the understanding of where he is coming from to a degree is what makes him one of the most popular comic book villains out there. The other horsemen that Apocalypse chooses just seemed to be shoehorned into the movie. There is few scenes that did stand out and it's basically the super action sequences. There is the introduction scene, Quicksilver to the rescue scene, Wolverine going berserker rage mode, Quicksilver fighting Apocalypse, Professor X going Freddy Krueger and Phoenix Force. So overall I don't regret seeing this movie in the theater, I do however regret seeing it in 4D. Because I personally thought it just wasn't worth it for this one. You can tell a lot about a man if you give him the crown and what he chooses to do with his power and how he treats people that are less fortunate. And I liked that type of message in this movie. Although the whole thing of the team getting together and bonding like a family isn't anything new but was nicely done. So I give this movie a 7.4/10.7.4/10",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516
2,DarkVulcan29,"Nowhere near as good has First Class and Days of Future Past, but still entertaining.",8/10,7 June 2016,"Apocalypse who was the first mutant ever, is from the Egyptian days. Awakens in 1983, he is more powerful than ever, and puts together his own band of mutants in hopes of world domination. It's up too Charles Xavier(James McAvoy) and his band of young mutants in hopes of stopping him.The well known characters like Cyclops and Havok and not to mention Beast don't really stand out as much they should. McAvoy is okay as Professor X, but it's Michael Fassbender as Magneto, that really takes the film, showing more Lars to the character, I was really liking his story arch. Jennifer Lawrence is alright here as Mystique. But Oscar Isaac has Apocalypse is creepy but no so much menacing, the animated Apocalypse was way more menacing. The effects are pretty descent, battle scenes enjoyable. I wonder there gonna be any more X-Men films, for me it ends with me not wanting anymore.",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516
3,TheFirstExecutioner,A Gripping but Flawed X-Men Movie,7/10,6 June 2016,"X-Men: Apocalypse is the sequel to Days of Future Past and takes place  about a decade later in the '80s. This movie entertained me from start  to finish and I can't say I was ever bored. But there are a lot of  things I was not satisfied with while watching. Starting off with the  good, Magneto and Professor X continue to be the best parts of these  movies. Michael Fassbender as Magneto is amazing and he has a really  emotional scene towards the beginning which got me locked into the  film. James McAvoy is also great as Xavier. The internal battles inside  Xavier's head were riveting. I really liked the new cast of the younger  X-Men, like Jean Grey, Storm, Nightcrawler, and Cyclops. Quicksilver  has another awesome scene just like the previous movie. The action is  handled very well for the most part. The first half of the movie is  terrific, but the second half brings it down.  Apocalypse as the villain was OK for me. Some scenes worked well and  others didn't. I was always skeptical of Oscar Isaac as Apocalypse and  I still don't think he was the best choice. He is just like Jesse  Eisenberg as Lex Luthor for me. Apocalypse is also a small mutant  compared to the others for some reason and he's just another villain  who is obsessed with destroying the world, and his motivations are  thin. Jennifer Lawrence was a boring Mystique. She just seems  uninspired throughout the run-time and becomes tedious since she uses  the personality over and over again to play the character. Some mutants  were completely wasted here with Psylocke and Angel. There's an entire  sequence in a secret lab and it seemed there for only one reason: the  cameo of a specific person. While it was fun to watch, it didn't do  much of anything for the story in the long run. The entire thing could  have been removed and the movie would have been the same. The final  battle felt underwhelming with the whole global extinction. The problem  is they don't show any civilians dying; it's just buildings coming  apart, making it hard to care about the situation.   Overall, X-Men: Apocalypse is a disappointing sequel to First Class and  Days of Future Past. But it is not at all a bad movie. Magneto and  Professor X are once again great, Apocalypse is a mixed bag, the pacing  for the movie is all over the place, and the dull second half just  brings the film down from the really good first half.  X-Men: Apocalypse gets a B-.",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516
4,Aaron1375,The X-men just band together to avoid the Apocalypse!,8/10,6 June 2016,"My expectations were low coming into this one so I am happy to report that I was pleasantly surprised by this film. It was not perfect, a Bryan Singer X-men film is never going to be perfect at this point, but it did contain a lot of cool action and quite a few mutants. Sure, I was not happy when I initially saw that Storm, Magneto and Psylocke were three of Apocalypse's horsemen in the film when none of them were in the comics; however, the story of why those three joined worked enough that I am not quite as baffled as I first was. I was disappointed by the fact that Angel was a bit more underutilized again, not sure why they find it so difficult to do him, but he does have more of a part here than in the his other film, X-men: The Last Stand which this film takes a jab at. I thought that was uncalled for, I do not understand why everyone dislikes that one so much as that one still has some of the better action sequences and fight sequences of any of the X-men films. A lot of people have been panning this one too, but as I said, I enjoyed it as I was expecting to dislike it quite a bit more than I did. It did do some things I was not fond of, but for the most part this one delivered for me.The story brings us back to Egypt where a strange being with great powers is about to transfer his consciousness over to a person who has great healing ability. This process is interrupted by people who tire of this being, claiming he is a false god and they collapse the pyramid. Unfortunately, the false god is not killed, but only locked away in a sleep. Flash years later and we witness a young Scott Summers learning his amazing ability, Mystique still trying to rescue her fellow mutants and Magneto trying to live life as an ordinary man. Things begin to be set in motion; however, and soon Apocalypse has awakened and he immediately takes a young girl who controls the weather under his wing and gives her incredible powers. He also finds a young woman named Psylocke, Angel and Magneto and he begins his plans to destroy the world and create it anew! Only the new students at Xavier's school for the gifted stand in his way of world domination! Once again, Mystique plays an important role in this film and pretty much aligns with the good guys. Once again, this baffles me as she was never that important in the comic and she never really joined up with the X-men, at least not up to the point I was reading them. They did do a good job of giving Storm and Magneto reasons for joining Apocalypse, but I was kind of disappointed by the way Psylocke was depicted as my mother who had never read the comics assumed that she was a villain in the comics. She is a good guy and though she looks the most like her character than any other character depicted in a Singer film, he managed to make her look too villainous. Nightcrawler was done well and though I still think they do not make Scott as good as he was in the comics he was done better here than the rest of the films. He actually got some good hits in this time! Of course, Quicksilver was once again quick and the most funny of the characters.So this one was good, could have been better, but I will not complain too much. The film is rated PG-13, but it has to be a pretty hard PG-13 as there were some pretty graphic deaths throughout this one. It would not have taken much more to make it an R. It was nice to have a different villain this time in Apocalypse and from the post credit scene if they do another film it will be another villain in that film as well. Though next up will be the next Wolverine film and after that probably Deadpool before another X-men comes out; granted, Deadpool more than likely does not exist in this universe though his character is owned by Fox too. Not sure how he'd do in one of these films, but I do know he would want to be the one to drop the one F-bomb in a most likely PG-13 X-men film. This one was not perfect, but better than expected so overall I was happy with the result and not mad I dropped money to see it in the theaters.",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516
5,xamtaro,Sacrifices thematic depth and complex characters for superficial thrills and repetitive plots,7/10,4 June 2016,"The word ""apocalypse"" brings to mind an end-of-the world event of biblical proportions. X- MEN APOCALYPSE brings to mind some Japanese anime and a yearning for the better X- men movies of the past. The third in this ""new trilogy"" that began with X-MEN FIRST CLASS, the franchise reached its high point in the epic X-MEN DAYS OF FUTURE PAST but now tips back down to a rather typical tale of good vs evil intertwined with the usual hero's journey. Thankfully the masterful execution of dialogue and acting chops saves this film from sinking into mediocrity.There are lot of plot threads to follow. Fortunately or unfortunately it does not require much inferring or complex thinking to follow the story. It is very simple and it is in its simplicity that it loses out on the richness of character than past xmen movies had. Our characters are all reduced to two dimensional archetypes each with familiar story arcs. So familiar in fact that the whole movie is a pastiche of plot points taken from past xmen movies. Eric is the grief stricken blood knight who goes evil with vengeance when tragedy strikes, again. Scott jean and Kurt are the inexperienced loners who have to work together to overcome their challenges, a little like pyro, Bobby drake (ice man) and kitty pryde (shadow cat) in X-men 2. Mystique replaces wolverine as the badass wanderer who is thrown into a leadership position to guide our young loners. Xavier is once again captured and the X-men's home base is compromised, again like X-MEN 2. Powerful mutant with delusions of godhood and a gang of loyal followers is Apocalypse this time replacing magneto's role in the first 3 xmen movies. Call it homage or call it cliché, I feel that this story manages to toe the line between familiar and fresh. The familiar elements gives us a sense of the revolving nature of conflict, that history repeats despite the best intentions. The fresh elements of course add new facets to a film which could have otherwise been a complete bore, thanks to the slow burn nature of the plot which mostly sees both good guys and bad guys gathering their key players for the final showdown. Those who can appreciate a slow build up would love this while those who need their immediate action fix would be left disappointed.Divisive might be the best word to describe this movie. When the action does come, it is a special effects spectacle of mutant powers on display where everyone.......pretty much stands around shooting things at each other. Oh look, the villain is getting the upper hand! Let's shoot more! Where physical stunts and fights come, they are a thrill to behold except the dated wire work which feels artificial. Interspersed between these divisive battles are particular scenes of movie magic. Quicksilver (last see in DAYS OF FUTURE PAST) returns and we get to see the full extent of his powers once again only on a larger scale. And at least this time he has a purpose in the story other than being a just a miraculous attempt. But as mentioned earlier his motivations are touched on but not explored. His character is simplified into yet another archetype.Beneath the visual spectacle, the movie under utilises its cast of characters. Ty Sheridan's Scott Summers could have been great as the new audience surrogate, going from meek bullied loser to taking his first steps as confident leader of the X-Men. Instead he is also shoved into the background after his introduction. Kodi-smith mcfee's more feline looking Nightcrawler is also another intriguing character sidelined. Instead we get more Charles Xavier and more Eric playing out their character drama like star crossed lovers. Don't get me wrong, they are fantastic actors, especially Michael Fassbender completely nailing the tragedy of Eric's character arc. But their story came to a decent close in the last movie and this one just feels like more of the same.Apocalypse himself is a villain that is as equally divisive as the movie itself. On one hand, it seemed that the creators were going for the ""all powerful but frail"" type of villain ala emperor Palpatine of Star Wars. The snake-like menace that Oscar Isaac exudes through his sinister delivery is betrayed by a design that borders on corny. Oversized platform boots, plastic looking Armour and an ill defined set of powers all downplay the threatening presence of the villain. His motivations could have been much deeper. A commentary on modern commercialism replacing the religions of old perhaps as the new ""cult following""? Or a criticism of humanity's arrogance and self glorifying nature? Maybe even a critique on how common folk are quick to idolise mortal ""false gods"" of the influential and powerful? No, no and no. None of that thematic depth here. Apocalypse is merely your Saturday morning cartoon variety villain who wants to destroy the world to rebuild in his image.It is not a bad movie per se. Visually stunning, an easy-to-follow plot and well cast characters set to a script filled with witty dialogue that does not overdo the comedy. The acting is professional and the music by John Ottman is a grand thematic continuation of But for a grand finale it pales in comparison to films like X-MEN 2 by glossing over its deeper themes of social commentary especially, in the treatment of mutants as an allegory to prejudice against social minorities. It lacks the urgency, high stakes tension and emotional depth of DAYS OF FUTURE PAST and the chemistry among the cast is no where near XMEN FIRST CLASS. I would place it as a middling entry into the X-men franchise that succeeds in opening the doors to a whole new generation of X-men movies.",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516
6,NDbportmanfan,Wasn't Great but Still Deserves a Watch,7/10,3 June 2016,"X-Men Apocalypse takes place in the 1980's, 10 years after the events in Days of Future Past. A god-like mutant has awaken and wants to destroy civilization in order to regain his rule. The X-Men must stop him before he becomes to powerful.I simply didn't find this story to be particularly interesting or believable compared to the other superhero movies in recent years. Apocalypse didn't look or feel all that powerful even though his powers would indicate he was. He was shorter than some of the mutants when in the comics he is a giant and didn't need much assistance. The gathering of the horseman was also kind of sad as he felt like he just picked up the first four mutants that he saw. There was nothing special about them, they each said I will join you but that is about it. Apocalpse is the kind of villain that you make into two movies, like what Disney is doing with Thanos. The first movie could have been used for Apocaplse to acquire his army of followers and the second could have focused on the battle and how the X-Men will respond to the situation. I guess that is why they are not doing that as the two would look similar. I personally don't think we needed another end of the world X-men movie given that we just got one. DoFP just seemed more intense of a situation which also lead to my mediocre interest in this battle. The scenes that didn't involve Apocalypse were for the most part quite enjoyable. Most notably the Quicksilver scenes as Evan Peters once again steals the show. The new actors also did great in their roles and had good chemistry with one another. Of course, this may be my own personal problem but again I find Jennifer Lawrence's Mystique to be just bland. The lines she spewed just lacked emotion and her one liners fell flat. I am glad that this was her last movie.I didn't enjoy the movie as a whole but the parts that I did like made up for the fact that it is just rather mediocre. I still recommend seeing it just be warned. 7/10",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516
7,claudio_carvalho,The First Mutant,7/10,31 July 2016,"When the first mutant En Sabah Nur (Oscar Isaac), who was worshiped as a god In Egypt, awakes in the present days, he learns how the world has been transformed in his absence. He decides to bring the Apocalypse to the word and recruits four powerful mutants to assist him in the destruction of the weak. Now the only change to save the world depends on Professor Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and a team of young mutants. ""X-Men: Apocalypse"" is another enjoyable adventure presenting the first and most powerful mutant of the world. The fight between the good and the evil is engaging and entertaining, supported by top-notch special effects that gives the sensation of a comic book on the screen. The best segment is the Magneto story in Poland and the fate of his beloved family. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""X-Men: Apocalipse"" (""X-Men: Apocalypse"")",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516
8,daviddevilliers54,X-Men Apocalypse may not be the best X-Men movie made but it is still enjoyable if you're an X-Men fan!,7/10,10 June 2016,"I loved all the X-Men movies, including X-Men Origins: Wolverine. I was so hyped when I heard they were creating an X-Men movie with Apocalypse in it. I have always loved superhero movies about the end of days. I will say specific parts that I loved and thought about this film and how I would recommend it.How good is this movie? It may not top the previous X-Men movies but that doesn't mean the movie is terrible. It is all based on opinion. Don't be scared to see the movie all because critics are making this movie look bad, go see it for yourself for your own opinion. You decide whether the movie is good or not. In my opinion, it is actually good. Not great, but good.Are the younger versions of the X-Men in this film? Yes. We have a younger version of Cyclops, Jean, Nightcrawler and Storm. We also have many amazing recurring members from the previous movies such as the young Professor X who was amazing, a slight older Magneto, Mystique who is also a little older and Beast who is still young as ever. And yes, Quicksilver returns and tops his amazing scene from X-Men: Days of Future's Past. How is Apocalypse the character? Honestly, I feel that Apocalypse was a little weaker than his comic version. If he was CGI like Thanos from Guardians of the Galaxy, he would've looked more threatening and tyrannical. I could basically compare this Apocalypse to a wimp who cosplays as Apocalypse with really good make up. His role is almost similar to Ultron.Is Wolverine in this? Yes! He may have a small cameo but it is a damn excellent cameo! When Wolverine enters the screen, the film basically transforms into an R-Rated action scene. Now that is who Wolverine is. It is also based on the real weapon x origin of Wolverine. He acts like a wild animal and slashes anyone who gets in his way and even this guy who begged Wolverine for mercy got his face ripped off! How dark is this film? It is actually pretty dark. There is a lot of death and depressing moments you will feel. We also get more connected with Magneto and why he hates humanity so much. It almost felt as he was the main antagonist in this film. We see his past and his present and why he turned into a dark and yet powerful supervillain. Also, the way Apocalypse murders people is pretty brutal and frightening.Would you recommend it? Of course! Like I said, it may not top the previous X-Men films but that doesn't mean it is terrible. If you love X-Men, as well as apocalyptic superhero movies, then this is the film for you. Go see it!",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516
9,daisukereds,"Another ""nothing"" movie",2/10,21 May 2016,"Another X-Men movie.. and again, not much of anything happens. There is a plot, yes, but it is poorly written and lacks substance/soul/meaning. The attitude of ""I don't care"" is what I came out with after seeing this movie. Instead of having a soul, it feels like a bunch of things put together in order to make money. You see characters, but aside from Quicksilver, which felt shoved in, no one really has an attempt at an arc.--- SPOILERS!!An hour into the movie, it SEEMS like something will happen. Two hours into the movie, they end the threat of Apocalypse. The end. Apocalypse wasted. I have several other issues with this movie, 1) Nightcrawler's teleportation is stopped by electricity? 2) Apocalypse access the internet by touching a TV. Yes yes, it is not the internet, but it is such a concept. Anyway, Apocalypse learns all the languages this way and sees the atrocities of humanity. What kind of powers did he have? He came from the beginning of mankind, and then jumps to the ""present"" where he magically has a mutant power that lets him access ""technology"". Anyway, awful! Reading minds would have been better. 3) The Angel transformation scene is simply stupid.. rock music, alcohol, a cool pose.. Apocalypse's way of ""convincing"" others into joining him is as bad. He says ""come with me"" and that's it. What does he want? To kill all! Sure, I'll join. 4) Apocalypsis takes Magneto to his conncentration camp (which is intact after who knows how many years) and somehow knows about Magneto's past for some reason. Knows his name, knows how he feels. 5) X-Men insults the Star Wars trilogy, calling the third (Return of the Jedi) as the worst one. Why? 6) Oh yes, Magneto lost everything, again. For some reason, he hasn't learned his lesson, and continues to hang out with women and have children. Then they get killed and he blames everyone! 7) Stan Lee's cameo is.. nothing. Him looking at the sky as a civilian. 8) Somehow, aside from being somewhat telepathic, or so I understood, Apocalypsis can also teleport for some reason. But then he states he needs Xavier's powers! So, which is it? Do you have all powers or don't? If you can do most of what it is shown you can do, why do you need 4 horsemen, or other mutants? 9) Quicksilver's scene, while awesome, is super coincidental. No reason why he should have saved everyone from an exploding mansion. He isn't in super speed 100% of the time! Nor he knows the place is exploding! Yet he walks right to the center of the mansion and sees and rescues everyone. Ugh. 10) So, a ""psychic event"" destroyed all the world's nukes, and Colonel Stryker tracked the source to Xavier's mansion.... suuuuure. 11) Wolverine shows up and kills people, retconing his origin. He then runs in the snow. Fine. There is no real ""Berserker Rage"". Anyway, sucks and unnecessary. 12) Psylocke uses a whip to fight, instead of her psyonich blades. 13) Magneto goes all-out-destructive with little reason.. but wait, he becomes good with even less. 14) Mystique turns into Psylocke and for some reason she has a blade. It was a ""twist"", if you can call it that. This scene, where she attempted to kill Apocalypse is the closes the writer could come close to a surprise situation. 15) Apocalypse turns big, yes, in a mind sequence. Looks bad by the way. Apocalypse does little to no shifting actions. He remains as seen in the pictures. 16) Quicksilver DOESN'T tell Magneto he is his father. The reason? There isn't one.They said Lawrence didn't do much in the movie, that it was the kids that did.. but ultimately, nobody really does anything. The fights are not even 2% of the movie, it's mostly talk (some bad lines, nothing mind bending). Mutants underused, which is the biggest let down. The movie is a lot of nothing! Oh, and the X-men have Sentinels now, for some reason.. Lots of stuff, lots of nothing. Not even a good waste of time.",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516

11,tankace,Great closure of the new trilogy,8/10,2 July 2016,"X-men Apocalypse has received mixed reviews from critics and some audience members, but I will say that ,is awesome no doubt. For starter it introduce the characters of Storm, Nightclawel, Cyclops, Marvel Girl and continued the thing of the new trilogy, with the First Class been in the sixties, Future in the seventies, this was in the eighties and the setting ,the costume and the references show that it was put work in to it.Now when I went to see it ,I had just finish my exam period in the university and I wanted something to light up. I get it and much more. For the title character Apocalypse I was pump and Oscar Isaak took this character ,whose freaking name is APOCALYPSE and gave an great performance ,that combine with the fact that the powers of the character were more that he fingers in my hands gave me much joy. To the story Apocalypse lived during antiquity and was praised and after a big sleep he awakes in the '80 and seeing how the world had become he decides to give lessons in power. For that he takes four persons to be his horsemen and increase their powers to maximum. Between them is also Magneto ,just THINK a buffed up MAGNETO my lord of Light protect me. Against them are the X-men who are a mix among the older team and the new students ,great!This movie like the First Clas is an X-men movie with out Wolverine in the lead role, though he makes a small cameo and I will say I was waiting to see him like that since the two thousands', the same apply to many of the new X-men who were much more in the movie than I expected and the actors done a fantastic job. Sophie Turner as Gean Grey, great choice and she is really well suited in this uncanny team, first you take the North and now the X-men I bend the knee to the new Queen of the Nerds!Now to the theme of the movie, here is family and what we are willing to do in order to have one, protect it and avenge it ,if it went there, the movie shows what are the X-men apart of superheroes ,are a family and as Macvoy says ""I feel sorry for the man who is going to hurt them (X-men)"" ,thanks Professor you are awesome. Now I get a bit why critics have hit this movie show much, it is because after Days of Future Past, Deadpool raise the standards for X-men flicks and the fact that only three weeks before Civl War was in release made many people to compare them and lets face it Civil is the best movie of Marvel so far! In the end between Batman versus Superman and Apocalypse the latter took wrongfully show mixed reviews. Also this the last movie with Jennifer Lawrence as Mustique ,pity but we end up with a high note.",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516
12,FabledGentleman,Spectacular,6/10,15 August 2016,"This is not going to be a long review, i want to summarize my thoughts on the film, now after i just saw it in the cinema.The movie is absolutely spectacular. The effects, the settings, the pacing, the acting, the music, the direction. It is all very well done, and if the story itself had kept up with the rest, this would be close to one of the best, if not the best, superhero film to date.But the story is a bit weak, it's hard to take in a few of the twists and turns in this film, but still everything else is so brilliantly crafted, the movie pulls it off anyways, and that makes me feel i got my moneys worth. This is very important to me when i go the cinema. I need to walk out feeling i was entertained.I'm usually the guy that puts story and script first when it comes to films. Way to often when the story is bad, the script and the acting and all the rest that follows almost always seem half done. This is not the case here.This movie is like when you bake a cake, and you end up putting in a small amount of salt instead of sugar. You notice you did, but you don't have time to fix your mistake, so you bake the cake to the best of your abilities anyways. At the end it's one hell of a spectacular looking cake you made, but people notice the taste is a bit off, but somehow the added salt contributed to the flavor in a good way, and the cake was very much edible.This is how i feel after seeing this film. It is really well crafted, and i do recommend people seeing it.",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516
13,trevorwomble,I think the critics have been way too harsh in this case - It's actually rather good.,7/10,18 May 2016,"As you can probably gather I thought this was another very good addition to the X-Men franchise. Whilst it doesn't hit the heady heights of Days of Future Past it still is a really good watch and I fail to see why it has had a mixed press.Firstly I found it to have a perfectly serviceable story, with Apocalypse and his followers recruiting the very vulnerable and angry Magneto as part of his plan to destroy civilisation and rebuild it in his image. Fassbender turns in another solid performance and you really feel his pain and confusion for the Erik/Magneto character. I also thought all the supporting cast were absolutely fine in their roles, and to me Evan Peters as Quicksilver really stole the scenes he was in and makes a fine addition to the cast. The same also goes to Tye Sheridan as Scott/Cyclops, whose back story is filled in better and with more depth than it was in the Wolverine origins film.I see the critics have been moaning about having too many characters in the film, yet I actually think it was handled better than it was in the Captain America: Civil War film. In Apocalypse the large cast do actually have something to do and contribute to the story, whereas the Captain America film felt like some were shoe horned in, which I felt made that film feel bloated and repetitive whereas this one at least get the storyline moving. I felt that Civil War felt way too long because of all the story padding yet Apocalypse, whilst also a long film, kept my interest to the end (and yes there is a post credits scene that I suspect is setting up Wolverine 3). I should also add that Apocalypse, despite it's bleak story, does have some moments of humour and wit that went down well with the audience.I also felt the surprise appearance of Wolverine fitted in nicely with the back story that we already know, particularly the one told in X Men 2 and the Origins film, nicely closing that particular characters story arc and fitting in perfectly with the circumstances surrounding his appearance in the very first X-Men film of 16 years ago. If this is to be Wolverines final appearance with the X-men then they have given him a lovely send off.I did find some minor flaws with the film though, particularly with the visual appearance of some of the characters and how their ages don't compute when the first X-men film of 2000 is taken into account. However, asides from that I thoroughly enjoyed X-Men Apocalypse and thought it was a solid & worthy addition to the other X-Men films. The films had spectacle, action, laughs and carried on with the journeys of the characters we have got to know and love over the past sixteen years.",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516
14,BA_Harrison,"Not as great as DOFP, but still a lot of fun for fans of the franchise.",8/10,27 July 2016,"The Nile Valley, 3600BC: mutant Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac) is revered as a god by the Egyptians, but his growing power proves to be his downfall, at least for a few millennia, as a group of concerned humans successfully carry out a plan to trap him under a collapsing pyramid. Cut to the 1980s, and Apocalypse is finally released from his tomb, recruiting several misguided mutants (including Storm and Magneto) as his followers in order to achieve world domination.There's an awful lot going on in this latest X-Men adventure, so much so that it's a little too much to take in at times. As a result, the storytelling suffers a little, but not enough to prevent this from being another fun addition to the franchise (my favourite superhero series by far). Not as mind-blowing as Days of Future Past, but still a very entertaining way to spend a couple of hours.Evan Peters as Quicksilver once again steals the show with another awesome display of his super speed abilities, rescuing the mutants of Professor Xavier's School for the Gifted from a massive explosion, but there is plenty else to wow the senses, the film packing in lots of slick set-pieces, including the spectacular opening 'pyramid collapse' scene, Magneto (Michael Fassbender) pushing his powers to the limit, and Wolverine on the rampage (an uncredited cameo from Hugh Jackman).7.5/10, rounded up to 8 for Olivia Munn as very sexy villainess Psylocke, the neat jibe about the third film in a series always being the worst, and for including Metallica's The Four Horsemen on the soundtrack.",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516
15,ironhorse_iv,"X-Men: Apocalypse was X-cellent, despite what some people might say about the film.",8/10,27 May 2016,"Following the critically acclaimed global hit, 2014's 'X-Men: Days of Future Past', director Bryan Singer once again returns to the X-Men Franchise with 'X-Men Apocalypse'. While, this movie might not be as good as the previous movie, it was still a blast to watch! I found it, very entertaining, in the face of its dark somber and emotional tone. I was very invested in the brutal story. It's just sad that some critics don't agree with me. I think, the main reason, why they might dislike, this movie is, because the fact that Warner Bros DC Comics 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' and Disney's Marvel Studios 'Captain America: Civil War', has been trying to do, more complex mortality stories, while 20th Century Fox is trying to simple it down with the standard comic book 'save the world' plot line. For the most part, I think, they're just being a little over critical. After all, the X-Men franchise has always been a little too serious or stretch out, with its stories, dealing with bigotry, prejudice, and diversity. It's time for them to take the franchise, a little more simple and straightforward with a standard extinction storyline. After all, it's a superhero film. Yet, this movie is no lightweight. It's still has depth and strong character development. While, the civil rights issues is not explore much, here; it was still kinda refreshing to see, the X-Men have to deal with issues, something bigger. I like the concept of rational humanism vs God worshiping, here. I just wish, it was discuss more, than being limited for more a visual disaster movie, tone. Don't get me wrong, I like the visuals in this film, but I felt that the CGI could need some more work. There were parts in the film that look utterly unnatural, due to the fakeness of the green screens like the Quicksilver/ Pietro Maximoff (Evan Peters) running scene. Despite that, I love, how absolutely brutal the action is for a PG-13 movie. I just wish, I knew, what was the villain's motivational was about. I get that, the Egyptian God/Mutant, En Sabah Nur/Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac) wanted to destroy the world, but I'm not entirely sure what he wants to do with it, really. It's never truly explored. He looks confused and clueless. Honestly, does he want to destroy mankind or not? It look like he could had wipeout the world, as least, 3 times, earlier in the film. Besides that, I kinda like this version of Apocalypse than the 'Age of Apocalypse' comic book version. After all, the comic version was a little too over the top with the caliber of his mutant powers. I thought Oscar Isaac did well for himself in this film. He really look and act very sinister. Still, I had a big problem with his henchmen, the Horsemen's motivations. I really don't get, why they're so willing to destroy the world. I get the reasons, why Archangel/Warren Worthington III (Ben Hardy) would, based on the story, presented and the comics; but why would Storm/Ororo Munroe (Alexandra Shipp) & Psylocke/ Elizabeth Braddock (Olivia Munn) join Apocalypse? Their motivations are not credible at all, unless, they were supposedly brainwash. Even with that, why the sudden change of heart, toward the end? Did Apocalypse's mind control suddenly turn off? It makes no sense. Anyways, there's a lot of destruction in 'Apocalypse', but very little consequence for the people that kinda starred it. It's weird that Storm would get away, scot's free, toward the end. On the other side, the motivational of the X-Men, both recurring characters and new ones were very clear. It's just odd, that Mystique/Raven Darkhölme (Jennifer Lawrence) is nothing like her comic-book counterpart. I get that Jennifer Lawrence is a big name and hate going through the long make-up process but couldn't they get her to appear and act, more like the Mystique from the comic books. After all, I kinda like villain, Mystique than hero version. It's really taking away, yet another leader role from Cyclops/Scott Summers (Tye Sheridan). He seem a bit, underdeveloped, here. Sophie Turner as Jean Grey was alright, despite, kinda being bitchy. Still, her American accent doesn't sound quite right, as her British sounding voice is really showing. As much as I dig the new characters, by far, the best is the recurring characters of Professor X/ Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and Magneto/Erik Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender). Both were amazing in their roles. It's just sucks, that the pair barely share a scene together here. I love that fascinating relationship between them. Stan Lee also has a cameo, but it come across, as really disturbing and awkward to watch. Also, it can't be, an X-Men movie without Wolverine/Logan (Hugh Jackman). He was alright in his small bit in the film, but the inconsistency with his character is just confusing. It doesn't match, well with the end events of the last movie. I guess, that scene was just a red herring. Still, it makes you wonder, how did the real Col. William Stryker (Josh Helman) capture him for the Weapon X program? The film is full of plot-holes like this. I know this movie marks the first installment in the new X-Men series following the Cosmic Retcon. However, I don't get in the timeline, that history has been altered so much, that some mutants have now been born long before they were in the original timeline and how the recurring characters are able to age so slowly. It's a bit jarring, but I willing to give some leeway, because thinking too much about it, will give you, a headache. Despite, the trouble timeline and artistic license to both history, science and comics; I didn't really allow it, to take me out of the movie. Overall: As a conclusion to a trilogy, 'Apocalypse' falls somewhat short. Still, I say go see it, as if there is no tomorrow! It's worth the watch.",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516
16,RNMorton,Good Stuff,8/10,5 June 2016,"X-Men is really an unusual franchise for Marvel. As an avid reader of Marvel during its breakout period fifty years ago, X-Men was a nice magazine but I would guess not one of their top sellers. Back then the talents were a little more modest, Cyclops and X-Girl were around along with Angel, Iceman and Beast (not blue). As a movie franchise I would guess X-Men is Marvel's top seller, they have gotten a lot of mileage out of the characters and have almost flawlessly crossed over to a younger cast (but for Wolverine). I have seen two or three of the most recent entries at the movies, but even though I have enjoyed them they are not something I die to watch again on cable.Which brings us to the most recent X-Men. Right off I have to say that Marvel excels at casting and the newer X-Men are no exception, the new Prof. Xavier (McAvoy) continues to be spectacular as does Fassbender as the Magnetic One. I thought the rest of the characters are done well also, including Peters as Quicksilver and a stunningly gorgeous Munn as Psylocke. The adversary for the X-Men is an ancient Egyptian mutant who seems too much to handle, the problem with these apocalyptic show-downs is that the next time out they sometimes feel they have to top it (ala Avengers I and II). This movie was not something I would necessarily see again (maybe?) but it never let up and me and my 11 year old never thought of leaving early, well done.",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516
17,GomezAddams666,This year's FANT4STIC,1/10,22 May 2016,"This movie is astoundingly terrible. The first 45 minutes of the film feel like bad long exposition and yet nothing really happens, a mutant appears in some random scene and they are recruited by either Apocalypse or the X-Men. The writing is all over the place and we don't get to know the characters, they're simply put there.Because Bryan Singer is in love wit Stryker of course we get to see the Weapon X program (again!) and of course, Wolverine because why not.As for the characters: Magneto barely does anything in the whole movie, Apocalypse is a one note villain, Xavier phoned it in and Jennifer Lawrence was NOT Mystique at all, as expected she played Raven Everdeen.Finally, the big battle comes and nothing really happened, the world is being destroyed and the governments sit quiet. SPOILER ALERT! And the way they defeat Apocalypse is by combining all their powers, just like in FANTASTIC FOUR (2005) or even FANT4STIC (2015).This movie has NO SOUL whatsoever, boring, badly acted, awful written, the worst movie of the year so far.",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516
18,realmuthaf,Apocalyptically bad,3/10,20 May 2016,"I personally thought Days of the Future Past to be the best of the series. And as it turns out, Apocalypse is the worst one to date.The only bright spot in all the awfulness is Quicksilver, whose slo-mo scene is at least as good as in the previous movie, if not better. Other than that, everything else goes from mediocre to outright terrible.The main villain's motivation is bland and stupid. (Yeah, he just wants to kill everyone and rule the world.) The way he ""persuades"" other mutants to join him is absolutely unbelievable - he basically just offers to increase a mutant's power and in return demands help to kill billions of people. Sounds like a fair deal. What's offputting is that the extent to which he augments his followers' powers is not constant. Like, Magneto gains the power to control pretty much all the metal on the planet at once, while Psylocke gains another special effect on her CGI laser beams or whatever it is that she emits. Apocalypse's abilities in general are largely undefined - at times he is shown pulling matter from objects around him to construct something, and then in the next shot he just makes solid objects like armor out of thin air. Another ridiculous thing was that they tried to make Isaac more intimidating by giving him thick soles so that he'd look taller, which is noticeable. What is more, his lines are cringe-worthy, but the problem is, so are everyone else's. Same boring cliché dialogues like ""It's your home. We will help. Join us, Eric. I see good in you.""Yeah, forgiving Magneto like it's nothing after he helps to kill millions of people and destroy entire cities is included in the package. Also, he changes his mind about the whole ""destroy the world"" thing after Mystique tells him for the 100th time that he is her family and she still sees good in him.Some of the characters' looks are still beyond ugly. I can actually see why they chose to try to keep the Beast and Mystique in their human forms more, except for saving the actors from the extensive make-up procedures. The thing is, these characters look absolutely god-damn atrocious and are painful to watch. I mean, Lawrence is annoying and redundant when she is on screen anyway, but when she is also blue, it just becomes vomit-inducing.Recent 2016 comic-book blockbusters also did not enjoy good scripts, but at least they had high-quality gripping action scenes. This is not the case here, as fighting is mostly goofy and bland, and at times it is clearly visible by the actors' motions that they are being pulled by the strings. Or being drawn in cheap CGI.This is actually sad. Singer's previous movie, DotFP, was outstanding. The recent Deadpool, who ostensibly shares the universe with the X-men, was awesome. And now we get a horrible, outrageously stupid and pretentious CG-overdosed mess. Let's hope the next one will be better.",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516
19,kunalkhandwala,They are uniting for good....,8/10,8 June 2016,"Ten years after the Paris peace accords, Professor Charles Xavier has recruited several students at his special school with the aim to establish it as the home for humans and mutants alike as they explore their strengths and grow together in harmony. But deep in the dark ruins of Cairo, an ancient power, En Sabah Nur has been awakened after millennia and has realized that the new unrelatable world needs to be destroyed so he can establish a new order. Deemed to be the very first mutant and the all powerful one, Apocalypse needed his four horsemen to pursue his devastating plans. The students at the Xavier school must now find within them, a way to harness their powers and use them to stop the apocalypse. The students must now become the X-Men. Erik (Michael Fassbender) lives a secluded life with his wife and daughter, concealing his powers while working in a foundry where one day, he is forced to use them to prevent an accident. The incident doesn't go unnoticed by his co-workers who report it to the authorities. An unfortunate encounter drives Erik mad with rage and his resulting vulnerability is soon exploited by Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac), who recruits him as his fourth horseman after Storm (Alexandra Shipp), Angel (Ben Hardy) and Psylocke (Olivia Munn). In a powerful display of his newly enhanced powers, Magneto desecrates the site of Auschwitz and threatens to build a new world for Apocalypse. Meanwhile, Raven/Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) and Alex Summers/Havok have been busy recruiting mutants such as Kurt/Nightcrawler and Scott Summers/Cyclops (Tye Sheridan). Also coming to their aid in the nick of time is Quicksilver/Peter Maximoff (Evan Peters), who steals the show each time he makes a run for it. Their sanctuary is compromised as Apocalypse learns about Charles' powers and kidnaps him to aid in his plan for gathering mutants across the globe. In the aftermath of the explosion, Hank, Mystique and Peter are taken captive by the Military, leaving Scott, Kurt and Jean Grey (Sophie Turner) in their hot pursuit. The rescue effort was doomed if it wasn't for the accidental release of Weapon X, that unknowingly aided in their escape from the facility. Magneto's control of Earth's poles causes widespread destruction, killing millions as En Sabah Nur almost enslaves Charles to his will. But it's Jean's psychic powers that find the call for help from her Professor and along with the young fighters and new recruits, they race to prevent Magneto and Apocalypse from causing Earth's total annihilation. Cyclops has an engaging introduction to the team and Tye portrays the fear of his uncontrollable powers in a credible manner. Nightcrawler always has a freaked out look but is entertaining while Beast is almost underplayed in his role. Olivia Munn's brief presence has a lot of intrigue still remaining about her origins and powers of being Psylocke. Alexandra plays a young, uncertain Storm who isn't evil enough yet to choose a permanent side. Evan Peters is as witty as he is hasty and Quicksilver is by far a show stealer when on-screen. Oscar Isaac's villain isn't the all-powerful as they hyped him up to be. His God-like powers were seldom on display to be ascertained as the biggest threat to superheroes, let alone break away from the cliché of apocalyptic villains who want to recreate the world. Mystique had the entire world focusing on her eccentricity after being exposed in Paris and Jennifer Lawrence shows her reservations very well. Her performance is deliberately underplayed but she holds her position as Charles' favorite by her own merits. Michael Fassbender displays the torment and inner rage that Magneto experiences with a lot of sincerity, making it an outstanding performance as a villain. His reluctance to join his friend's school is deeply rooted in his suspicion of humans who have caused most of his tragedies. James McAvoy is extremely likable as Prof Xavier because he quite naturally charms his righteousness through to us while showing genuine care for both mutants and humans. Sophie Turner's Jean Grey surprisingly ends up being the highlight of the film and not because of her character's importance in saving the day each time. She has invested in the character that's learning to unleash her powers with a lot of reluctance at first and then realizing her true potential. She is a far better Jean Grey than her predecessor and with Mystique by her side, her development should get a lot more exciting. Director Bryan Singer (several X-Men films) is more than familiar with character introductions, mega villains and optimizing CGI to aid his storytelling and action. Yet, the film does lose the gravity of a major villain who was supposed to be the greatest nemesis of the X-Men. To see him so grossly under-utilized with just a handful of action scenes and a lot more of clichéd dialogues is quite disappointing. Apocalypse may not be the best X-Men film to date but it sure is as fun, exciting and entertaining as the best of them. What it lacks in, it makes up for in the attributes of its characters who are either too righteous or perfectly balanced now to fall on either side. 8.513 on a scale of 1-10.",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516
20,Dannyboi94,"A good film, but expected more",7/10,17 June 2016,"This movie had a difficult task, trying to top 'Days of Future Past' which in my opinion is one of the greatest superhero movies of all time, while this film was good, it fails on many aspects that made the previous one so good.The acting here is very good, there is not one bad actor here. Michael Fassbender is the star performer here, the scenes in which he was the centre of, always turned out great. But I would go as far to say, we did not see enough of him. The movie follows the heroes more, but does do a great job at showing the threat of Apocalypse. Oscar Isaac as the main villain was a brilliant choice. From the trailers and posters, I believed that he would be over the top, but instead he is intimidating. The story on the other hand, is not too compelling. X-Men, X-Men 2, First Class and Days of Future Past, have all had great stories. They were all perfectly paced, with enough going on to keep you both, invested in the main characters and everything else that's going on. This film is a mess. Some characters were a complete letdown, we were made to believe that they would be kick-ass, but instead they stood in the back not uttering a word. I would say that I was not greatly disappointed in Jennifer Lawrence character here, while she was important, I believed that she did not suit well in the hero role. Mystique is a villain, and she should stay that way. By having her being an hero this time around, does seem right.This film is not bad, the critics, yet again don't know what they hell they are doing, with their ridiculous reviews, but this is not even close to being as good as the other X-men films we have had. With the exception of Origins: Wolverine (shivers). Go see the film is you are a fan of the series, and you will possibly like it, but don't expect it to be as good as the last one.7.4/10",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516
21,zardoz-13,Another Great X-Men Adventure!!!,10/10,7 June 2016,"Although it isn't coining the box office receipts that ""Captain America: Civil War"" commanded, ""X-Men: Apocalypse"" surpasses ""Captain America"" with lavish spectacle, brinksmanship suspense, and fertile fantasy. Part of the reason is that Twentieth Century Fox produces the ""X-Men"" movies, while Walt Disney Studios handles the ""Captain America"" franchise. The ""X-Men"" franchise displays greater edge and paranoia than the formulaic, facetious, Disney Marvel franchises. For example, the body count in ""The Usual Suspects"" director Bryan Singer's latest Marvel Comics adventure ""X-Men: Apocalypse"" is double, perhaps even triple that of ""Captain America."" ""Sherlock Holmes"" scenarist Simon Kinberg and Singer have no problem with liquidating some X-Men characters. Meantime, Disney produces Marvel sagas where few super-heroes suffer permanent injury. The divide and take sides ""Captain America: Civil War"" concluded in a stalemate with Cap and Iron Man playing patty-cake. The inescapable problem that Singer and Kinberg face in the ninth ""X-Men"" franchise entry is predictability. The original ""X-Men"" trilogy charted the story of Xavier's mutant super-heroes along chronological lines. The second ""X-Men"" trilogy, starting with ""X-Men: First Class"" (2011), then ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" (2014), and finally ""X-Men: Apocalypse"" ventures backward in time, examining the origins of various characters. ""X-Men: First Class"" dealt with the 1962 Cuban Missile crisis, ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" unfolded at the end of the Vietnam War in the 1970s, and ""X-Men: Apocalypse"" transpires in the 1980s. ""X-Men: Apocalypse"" makes several allusions to ""X-Men: First Class"" about Professor Xavier's romance with CIA Agent Moira MacTaggert. Since the second ""X-Men"" trilogy occurs before the original trilogy, we know the principal characters are in little danger of annihilation. Nevertheless, Simon Kinberg's screenplays for those three films have all been imaginative, audacious, with the X-Men taking things to the brink. Clocking in at an extensive 144 minutes, ""X-Men: Apocalypse"" doesn't wear out its welcome, and Singer doesn't short-change his packed ensemble cast. Furthermore, the malevolent Apocalypse in his first full-blown cinematic incarnation proves to be a challenging opponent. ""X-Men: Apocalypse"" qualifies as a larger-than-life but slam-bang, sci-fi supernatural saga staged with considerable intellect, wit, and panache.""X-Men: Apocalypse"" opens during a pharaoh's burial ceremony in ancient Egypt in 3,600 B.C. Naturally, Singer relies on spectacular CGI special effects galore to conjure up this vast, sprawling, ceremony as the first mutant, Apocalypse, finds himself betrayed by a duplicitous cabal. They trap Apocalypse in a pyramid, and the structure vanishes into the earth for 5,600 years until the 1980s when CIA Agent Moira MacTaggert (Rose Byrne of ""Bridesmaids"") stumbles onto it. She finds a passage that leads to Apocalypse's burial chamber. A cult has been struggling to resurrect the notorious lord, and Apocalypse emerges from captivity to find the world greatly altered from his day. Dark and sinister, with tubes curving out of the back of his head, Apocalypse emerges as an ominous figure in a bizarre outfit. He saves a Cairo street thief, Ororo Munroe (Alexandra Shipp of ""Straight Outta Compton""), from two vigilantes. Eventually, Ororo will become Storm. He recruits a fallen angel, Angel (newcomer Ben Hardy), and Apocalypse transforms Angel's wings into steel so he has the ability to hurl razor-sharp metal feathers which are comparable to machetes. The most important recruit that Apocalypse attracts is Magneto, Erik Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender of ""Prometheus""), who is in no mood to love mankind. Erik has suffered another great personal tragedy. During the intervening ten years since the events in ""X-Men: Days of Future Past,"" Erik has maintained a low profile as a factory worker in Poland. Sadly, he is forced to reveal his mutant ability to manipulate metal when he saves a fellow factory worker from certain death. Unfortunately, the local authorities descend on him with bows & arrows. Magneto flees and joins Apocalypse. Apocalypse is appalled at everything that has transpired during his protracted absence, and he decides to change everything with the help of Erik, Storm, Angel, and a ""Wonder Woman"" lookalike warrior Psylocke (Olivia Munn of ""Ride Along 2""), who boasts both telepathic and telekinetic abilities and dresses like a dominatrix. The collateral damage that Apocalypse and his henchmen create overwhelms the entire Disney Marvel Universe. Impudently, Apocalypse prompts all of the superpowers to launch their nuclear warheads into space where the ordinance will be useless and civilization will depend on the intervention of Professor Xavier (James McAvoy of ""Wanted"") and the X-Men that are a lot younger than their predecessors. Happily, Jennifer Lawrence reprises her role as Raven, and Nicholas Hoult returns as Hank McCoy aka Beast.As exemplary as ""X-Men: Apocalypse"" is, ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" still tops it, but the two movies differ in terms of scope. Director Bryan Singer isn't as enamored with the 1980s in ""X-Men: Apocalypse"" as he was with the 1970s in ""X-Men: Days of Future Past."" He cuts back and forth between the heroes and the villains as they clash. This extravaganza serves up one good scene after another. Two of the best occur when Peter Maximoff (Evan Peters of ""Kick Ass"") aka Quicksilver and Wolverine demonstrate their respective skills. Quicksilver embarks on a rescue mission at Xavier's School for Gifted Children after the building comes under attack. Quicksilver darts about like a wraith snatching somebody here and seizing somebody there, before the house collapses in a pile of smoking rubble. This scene provides some genuine levity in the middle of Apocalypse's devastating plans to renovate planet Earth. Without divulging too much information, Wolverine's solitary scene is as savage as it is sensational. The grand finale between Charles and Apocalypse is a drawn-out, but exciting exercise that drums up white-knuckled suspense. The evil first mutant intends to freight his consciousness into Xavier's body and then appropriate Xavier's gift to connect with everybody's mind on the planet. While Charles and Apocalypse tangle like maniacs, the X-Men have their hands full with Apocalypse's Four Horsemen.If you haven't kept up with the ""X-Men"" cinematic universe, you may find its plot difficult to follow.",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516
22,fredschaefer-406-623204,Better than the critics would have you believe.,8/10,4 June 2016,"If X-MEN:APOCALYPSE does not quite rise to the level of DOFP it is not for want of trying, for this latest installment in the franchise really goes for the bigger is better style of film making. From the beginning, many of us longtime Marvel and X-Men fans have waited with anticipation for the movies to tackle En Sabah Nur, one of the mutant's biggest foes, and for the most part, the movie pays off nicely.But it is not without its flaws, starting with a tiring two and half hours running time, mostly because the first 45 minutes or so is all about exposition and setting up the many, many characters who appear, including Apocalypse himself, his future four horsemen, the teen age versions of some X-Men anchor characters, along with catching up with Charles Xavier, Eric Lehnsherr, Mystique and Quicksilver. This has become a staple of the X movies, where different versions old favorites have to the reintroduced over and over again. Nobody trusts the audience to just jump right in to the story and go with it. It's nearly an hour into the film before the good mutants and bad mutants begin to move in directions that will lead to the inevitable Big Showdown at the end. I will say that for the most part, the movie is free of the clunky plotting that is so obvious in other super hero movies-BATMANvSUPERMAN being one of the most recent and worst offenders.As in all comic book movies, if there is a good villain, then it's a good movie, and in this respect, Apocalypse might be seen as something of a disappointment in that he's just another megalomaniacal super villain bent on taking over the earth because he's just better than everybody else. In a lot of ways, he just comes off as a mutant version of Ultron. But this is where casting is key, and Oscar Isaac gets so much more out of the part than was evidently in the script, with makeup that is a dead ringer for the comic book and FoxKids cartoon version of the character. Isaac is able make this Apocalypse truly menacing by using a good actor's best tools: his voice and facial expressions. He truly gets this villain's malevolence. Of course at the end, we get the standard face off with evil, where some of the bad guys have a sudden epiphany and change sides, while the supremely all powerful Apocalypse merely wounds and disables the heroes when he could clearly just kill them outright, but then they wouldn't all be able to join forces and take him down, like we've seen so many times before in other super hero movies.The best part of the bigger is better comes when Quicksilver saves the students at the Xavier Institute from certain death in an explosion; this is CGI at its best and utterly tops the great scene in DOFP where the speedster rescued Magneto. It alone is worth the price a ticket, which is due in no small part to Evan Peters, reprising his role from the previous movie and building upon that earlier performance. Another great scene is the caged match between Angel and Nightcrawlwer. Tye Sheridan, Sophie Turner and Codi McPhee-Schmit are excellent as the junior league versions of Cyclops, Jean Grey and Nightcrawler. James McAvoy and Nicholas Hoult are back as Charles Xavier and Hank McCoy, so too are Josh Helman and Rose Byrne as William Stryker and Moira MacTaggert. Newcomer Ben Hardy is Archangel, while Alexandra Shipp easily steps into Halle Berry's shoes as Storm. The best acting, by far, is done by Michael Fassbinder as Eric Lehnsherr, who perfectly captures Magneto's torment as, yet again, tragedy pushes him to the dark side. The death of his family in the woods is one the strongest scenes in any of the X films. But how many times do we have to see the same sequence where he and Charles have the same conversation over whether mutants and humans can live together and will Eric stay and be part of the solution or just walk away-again. And it's always great to see Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique, who manages the nail the comic book character to a tee. That Hugh Jackman cameo as Weapon X wasn't really needed, but he is still a welcome sight in what will always be his signature role. Best piece of dialogue: that dig at LAST STAND.As for the next movie, well bring on Mr. Sinister and the Mutant Massacre.",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516

I admit I have trouble following Magneto's sympathetic storyline; the man's a mass murderer (just saying). But the actor is incredible.My main complaint about this movie is Apocalypse. Played by a great actor, his makeup makes him look like a puppet, the voice effects make him sound like a robot, his lines are cringey, and he is hilariously overpowered. I assume he is from the comics, since he was also in the Evolutions cartoon, but perhaps he just doesn't transfer well to the big screen. Or perhaps he was just poorly represented in this movie. I feel badly for Oscar Isaac. Why didn't they leave off some of the layers of makeup and voice effects and let the man ACT?There were other aspects that took it from campy to ridiculous, but that was the main one.",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516
24,morrison-dylan-fan,X-Men: Age of Apocalypse.,7/10,1 July 2016,"After finding Captain America: Civil War to be far better than expected,I was happy to discover that a new X-Men title was also coming out.With having somehow missed seeing the last few X-Men flicks,I decided that it was time to catch up with the gang.The plot:Betrayed by his worshippers,the first ever mutant En Sabah Nur is entombed alive.1983:Finally breaking out of the tomb (only took a few 100 years!) Nur finds a world which has lost its way,due to the ""weak"" ruling it.Deciding to remake the world to his dream design,Nur starts gathering up fellow mutants to work with him.On the other side of the world, Alex Summers learns that his brother Scott is getting mutant abilities,which leads to Alex taking Scott to Professor Charles Xavier's school,so that Scott can get a grip on his abilities.AS Scott begins his training, Xavier and his fellow mutants soon discover that the ""first ever"" mutant has come back from the dead.View on the film:Mutating over a 2 and a half hour running time,returning co- writer/(along with Simon Kinberg/ Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris) director Bryan Singer & cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel largely take an underhanded manner to placing the X-Men in the 80's,with Reagan photos,fading Cola billboards and Metallica tracks scattered in the background. Exploding the action over a large canvas,Singer skilfully uses slo-mo to make the special skill of each X-Men stand out,as Nur's chaos pours down like a halo of bullets.Continuing on themes from the very first X-Men movie,the screenplay by Singer/Kinberg/Dougherty and Harris deliver a sincere message about being proud of your true self,which helps to give the action an underlying purpose.Going back to the very beginnings of the X- Men,the writers cleverly find spaces to pull threads from the past films,which along with tying up the loose ends nicely, also reveals how dangerous Nur is.Filling every corner with X-Men action,the writers appear unsure over how to carry the legacy of the past 8 films over,due to the huge baddie and large number of X-Men leading to any pauses to help each mutant stand out largely being skipped,as the X-Men face the apocalypse.",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516

26,OlieRendch,Mostly well-done with one of the best villains of the franchise. One or two flaws.,8/10,2 June 2016,"So X-Men: Apocalypse is either the third, sixth, or ninth film in the series depending on how you're counting and stars James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender and Jennifer Lawrence returning for a third time while bringing in new cast such as Oscar Isaac, Sophie Turner and Tye Sheridan. The basic plot is that an ancient, powerful mutant known as En Sabah Nur has awoken in the 80s and wants to ""cleanse the earth"" of the weak and so the X-Men must stop him.As a whole, I like the X-Men franchise; despite it's bumps I've always felt it's had it's own vibe and personality and is different enough from other comic book universes such as the MCU and the not- so-connected DC properties. X-Men: Apocalypse continues in this and although shares similarities with other movie plots still feels like an X-Men movie. The stories we witness in this film are some of the finest we've seen in the franchise. The two biggest characters we've been following for years of course are Professor X and Magneto and each of them are so well-developed and incredible characters you know exactly what they are feeling and why they are where they are. Magneto's arc in this film is a highlight and from one particular scene in a forest you are hooked on his story and understand why he's doing the things he is. Professor X is great as the leader and strong-minded force who keeps the X-Men together and he really has some great scenes, especially towards the end. Another story in this movie is of course the one of the titular character himself, Apocalypse; his backstory in Ancient Egypt alone was a thrilling and well executed event and when you really see what he can do in the 80s I found him to be the most powerful and best villain they've had in the franchise. Just his voice, and mannerisms are so dark and menacing you really feel like he is an unstoppable threat.Apart from those three, other character highlights were the young Jean Grey, Cyclops and Nightcrawler who fit well into the story and I really enjoyed seeing them, and then of course Quicksilver returning from Days of Future Past doing much more in the movie including one of the best scenes of any superhero movie, beating that of his previous. Everyone else did OK but weren't really used as much; Jennifer Lawrence's Mystique doesn't do quite as much as she has done and never has her own 'action piece' as it were and then three of the horsemen, Psylocke, Angel and Storm each had one particular shot that was cool but mostly stood around until the climax where they still didn't have too much screen time.Effects wise, all the powers and abilities looked fantastic. There was a lot of CGI and green-screen during the climactic battle and for me personally I thought that all looked just fine. There were one or two specific shots which weren't particularly good in my eyes but that was it.Some problems I had with the movie was that, as I said, some characters didn't really have much screen time and/or didn't really do anything at all (looking at you Jubilee) and then another thing isn't really a problem as it is the ninth X-Men-related movie but X- Men: Apocalypse requires you to know and remember quite a bit of the past films and this universe in general, so it makes it almost inaccessible completely to the general movie-going audience and unless you've seen at least five of the other films a lot will go over your head and seem out of place. And as a final negative point there were two scenes in particular that pushed the 12A (PG-13) rating to it's limits which will be fine for a lot of people but I think some will be quite surprised at how dark they went.Other than that X-Men: Apocalypse is a really powerful and thrilling superhero movie, and for me one of the best in the series, not quite beating First Class as my favorite.",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516
27,Brevin_Campbell,A decent X men film,7/10,25 June 2016,"X Men apocalypse adds nothing new to a landscape filled with superhero films and lots of X Men films of old, but just cause it doesn't add anything new doesn't make it a bad film. \From Xavier going bald to Magneto becoming one of the four horseman this film is standard from beginning to end, but I can't say I didn't enjoy it. It was fun to see Magento completely wrecking the X Men. And all of the end of the world stuff wasn't too bad either. I enjoyed Apocalypse as a villain even if he was cliché.The movie doesn't develop the 4 horsemen enough, but that not a bad thing at all. They didn't need to much development. What they were given was good enough for the story that was trying to be told.Quicksilver steals this movie though. He really is the best part of this franchise",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516
28,851222,It would be a lie to say it wasn't entertaining,8/10,19 September 2016,"Greetings from Lithuania.To my surprise (after reading some pretty bad reviews from critics) - i had a pretty good time watching ""X-Men: Apocalypse"" (2016). Because i'm not a fan, i was pretty lost at the beginning - although seeing all movies in the series i wasn't even sure what time line are we in it this time - its because previous film was so forgettable, i wasn't even sure what was going on in the beginning, when all of these x-men started to pop in on screen - like ""wait - wasn't he or she a villain in some previous whatever it was movie?"" Wasn't' he or she killed? Oh wait, this is a prequel. To a sequel? Wait, what? About the best thing in this movie - with every performance of a brilliant Oscar Isaac i witness, the more i believe this man will hold Oscar statue pretty soon - it's just a question of when. Although under heavy make-up and costume, he was a superbly cool villain in my opinion, who just FELT as a total bad ass of bad asses - surely some better lines for him wouldn't have hurt, script isn't strongest in this movie, but it not bad at all either. Others were pretty good, but none of them really shined. Overall, to be short as possible and honest, i'm not a fan of ""X- Men"" nor other Marvel superheroes. But it would be a lie to say i wasn't entertained for like 2 h 15 min. watching ""X-Men: Apocalypse"" (2016). It has lots of special effects, and they were solid. It also has pretty cool scene in the middle, when someone gets to save someone - nice stuff. Film also had a nicely paced plot, although there is a lot of going on in this movie, A LOT - it was nicely paced and i wasn't bored nor i lost my interest in watching it.",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516
29,valadas,Fanciful indeed,7/10,22 June 2016,"In what concerns special effects it is the most stunning movie I have ever seen and only for that it is worth to be seen. Scene succeeds scene in hallucinating speed. In a society where humans live together with mutants not always in very friendly terms, the first mutant is awaken after thousands of years (he was worshiped as a god in Ancient Egypt where the movie starts) and seeing that the world is not good he decides to destroy it to create a new society and a new world order above which he would reign. Then a group of young X-Men (boys and girls) start a fight against his purpose in order to save mankind from destruction. This struggle unites humans and also a few mutants who have extraordinary superpowers they use in the amazing scenes above referred. A movie that keeps you rooted to your seat from the first to the last image.

30,Irie212,A question for comic book fans.,7/10,1 June 2016,"This isn't a review of X-Men Apocalypse (a movie I enjoyed, as my rating indicates). Rather it's a question-- an observation, really-- about the genre. Screenplays are based on original ideas, or they're adapted from another source, such as a book, a fairy tale, a play, a TV show, etc. Comic books have recently become a gold mine for adapted screenplays, but the genre isn't new. In 1931, the movie ""Skippy"" was based on a comic strip, and the screenplay was nominated for an Oscar. Two more nominations came in 2003, for ""American Splendor"" and ""Our Cancer Year,"" both based those respective comic book series.Most moviegoers understand that adapting a film from a book or another source means a departure from the original material. Film, after all, is a different medium with different demands on creativity, including whole armies of creative collaborators led by the director and writer(s).But fans of Marvel and DC Comics don't seem to understand that when they enter the movie theater, they're going to see a movie, not a comic book come to life. Many reviews posted here seem to be looking for absolute faithfulness to the original material, which is not only unrealistic (film has different tools), it is an insult to the creative filmmakers who adapt the material.I've seen all the X-Men movies, and the various Avengers films, and Superman and Batman, and etc.-- I'm a genuine fan of the genre. But I have read none of the comics. Not one. I was a film student, and learned to appreciate that medium on its own terms. My favorite novel is ""Moby Dick,"" but nobody needs to read Melville's masterpiece to know that the movies based on it are mediocre. Nor does anyone have to read ""Moneyball"" or ""The Martian"" or ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"" or ""The Maltese Falcon"" or ""Rebecca"" to know the film adaptions are good.Films must be judged on their own merits, not on how closely they adhere to the original source material. If comic book fans come to terms with that, they may find themselves enjoying the original as well as the adaptation.",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516
31,goolizap,Twizard Rating: 94,9/10,22 June 2016,"X-Men story lines all pretty much revolve around the same theme: Humans fearing mutants and acting upon it irrationally, causing bad mutants to revolt and good mutants to attempt peace.We start off in 3600 B.C., with set pieces that showcase ancient Egypt as good as any we've seen since maybe The Mummy in 1999. Here, the first mutant known to man, En Sabah Nur aka Apocalypse (though his name doesn't seem to really be important), gets betrayed and trapped underground for centuries. This dude would've given me nightmares if I saw him as a child.Then we wind up in the 1980s, with some cool zeitgeists of the era. But not too much so that it becomes a nostalgia flick--though that wouldn't be too bad either. We catch up with our X-Men stars ten years after the events in X-Men First Class. We're introduced to a few new mutants and get most of our favorites back. Apocalypse gets awoken from his long sleep and decides to assemble a team to kill off humans--along with any mutant who stands in his way. The film does a great job of balancing a cornucopia of character's story lines. Everyone is accounted for, but wisely, most of the villains aren't touched upon that much--including Apocalypse. Some may argue that he lacks a unique incentive, but when you're the most powerful mutant ever and thirst for omnipotence, what other incentive do you need? But it does go beyond that. His philosophy is Hitler-esque in that he wants to destroy who he believes to be inferior beings. And he's given a sort of false-charisma that makes the fact that he has followers believable.The only other villain for which we get sufficient depth established is Magneto--perhaps the most compelling story in the whole X-Men saga--with only Wolverine's giving it a run for its money. Magneto walks the line between good and evil at times in the series, with his fantastic dynamic/friendship with Professor Xavier furthered upon even more in this film.The action doesn't feel empty and neither does the plot. The characters are enjoyable and we don't feel cheated out of anyone's backstory. But we don't feel forced into one either. The good thing about having multiple movies and prequels is that we trust that, in time, we will know each character's origin.X-Men: Apocalypse may not have the most radical of premises within the X-Men universe, but its a subject that is still treated with much realism and ongoingness--something other franchises don't do quite as well. The civil war battle thing has been a common theme among superhero movies this year, and X-Men does it best. Something of the grandest proportions is actually at stake. Heroes and civilization as a whole may actually be destroyed.It all makes this a solid installment in the series and maybe the best superhero movie this year (so far). Plus, its plethora of characters and a creepy antagonist make the movie engaging and not feel quite as long as it is. We needed some redemption after the slap-in-the-face time travel entry, Days of Future Past, nullified the stories in a franchise we've grown to appreciate. That was more of a cool idea in the moment, while this movie is an important idea.Oh, and we also get an esoteric post-credits scene, whose meaning will most likely be forgotten by the time the next film comes out anyway.Twizard Rating: 94",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516
32,anaconda-40658,Advertising Jennifer over Mystique.,7/10,20 June 2016,"X-Men: Apocalypse (2016): Dir: Bryan Singer / Cast: James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence, Sophie Turner, Oscar Isaac: End of the world is upon us with the release of ancient mutant Apocalypse. His plan is to wage war on humankind and destroy the planet in favor of rebuilding a new one. James McAvoy returns as Professor Xavier whose ability to invade one's mind is a prime target of Apocalypse. Michael Fassbender as Magneto deals with another loss as his attempt to blend in with humanity is countered with the death of his wife and daughter thus making him a prime target for Apocalypse's arguments against mankind. What is unfortunate is the amount of time we see Jennifer Lawrence on screen verses her change into Mystique whereas in the original series we rarely saw Rebecca Romijn. This is all about celebrity status and less about character. Sophie Turner as the troubled Jean Grey who struggles to maintain control of her powers and foresees what is to come. Oscar Isaac plays the monstrous Apocalypse whose power and ability to descend through centuries is due largely to his ability to manipulate his followers. He will increase their powers but only to his benefit. Bryan Singer returns as director and is backed with a decent screenplay and explosive special effects but the results are far from special. With the exception of the constant reminder of Lawrence's celebrity presence the casting is fine and many of the mutant characters compelling, including a cameo from Wolverine. The result is an entertaining film that will work on the imaginations of hardcore fans. Score: 7 ½ / 10",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516
33,FallenEye,"Apocalypse: Only a Supervillain, not an Event",7/10,4 June 2016,"This movie is by no means, bad... In fact, it is a very enjoyable watch. Bryan Singer paid attention to story, however, 2 big problems arise from the ashes Apocalypse wanted to build upon.Firstly; Apocalypse wasn't supposed to just be the main villain, he was also supposed to be THE event, an apocalyptic event - I'm sorry, but after 16 years, the wait doesn't quite feel over just yet... Sadly, he was incredibly underplayed. The dude is immortal, period! He can alter his molecular form to suit any situation... He can possess any being of his choosing, at will... Transform different parts of his body into weapons simultaneously, and absorb energy... So, Cyclops is probably the WORST person to fight him! Also, as far as I know, Apocalypse already had telepathic abilities... The man is damn near impossible to defeat, but I understand that it has to be done, however, the way in which it was done, though very enjoyable to watch, wasn't good enough. Phoenix had to do it, but, was Jean ready to transform? And also, were the humans, the human race aware, that uuhhm, the world might end? I mean... the apocalypse was, so contained that, I could've been in Egypt watching Survivor, while completely unaware that I may not.However though, a lot about him, was done right... Was done very well. His ability to enhance powers, his demagogue ability... His apparent bond with celestial technology... His presence as a whole, was arrogant and powerful (nicely done Oscar), and I liked that.Second problem; You spend the whole movie trying to figure out if, the time line makes sense... I mean, Apocalypse is the 8th installment of this universe, and they've been going so back and forth in time that, I may just get a second shot at that other love of my life that got away back in 2007, in 2007. But whats awesomely annoying is, Bryan Singer may be linking the times like a pro.From there, Quicksilver - the only thing Fox did far better than Marvel - was amazing. Xavier, Magneto, Beast and Nightcrawler delivered. Mystique... I don't know, Jennifer didn't feel like she wanted to be there. Jean, Cyclops and Havok, the relations were relayed well, Psylocke (who's so very hot) and Angel were, meh... And Storm... (Alexandra also, so very hot), OK.Disappointed, no. Apocalypse could've blown me away, but, I'm happy to stay. 7/10.",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516
34,Quinoa1984,sweet dreams are not made of this,4/10,29 May 2016,"X-Men: Apocalypse, where we get the X-Men another full ten years later (also still have barely aged a day since First Class, but whatever, movie), and now the stakes are GLOBAL! It's time for a blue-skinned Mighty Morphin Power Rangers Movie villain steps up to bat to take over everything to ""cleanse"" humanity, and take on his four horsemen/women for this apocalypse while the X-Men sort of race to stop him (I say sort of since they get captured at one point).This movie is... a movie, that exists. It's the textbook definition of an ""eh"" experience. I didn't hate it, there's actors in it still trying and working their butts off to dig deep into characters they've been in for three movies now (McAvoy and Fassbender come off best, Lawrence is sometimes in it and sometimes not), and there's new people (Sophie Turner for one) who are trying as well. But what they're given is... minuscule, too little, and too undercooked. This is the kind of movie that features both Beethoven's 7th symphony/2nd movement and it made me think of the Nic Cage flick Knowing and how *that* used the song better (which wasn't much at all), and then uses at another point Metallica's ""Four Horsemen"" because, hey, title! These may sound like small points, but they're what I latched on to while watching this. It's a plot that is both stupid and rehashed not only from other X-Men movies but from other movies in general. The End of the World OMG scenario doesn't cut it anymore (not that Fox will stop if Independence Day 2 is any indication, but I digress). And unlike the previous two films which were rich in character and motivation and using the period they're set in - 62 and 73, the height of Cuba and Nixon - there's not much here to distinguish it from the 80's aside from the obvious Thriller jacket and Star Wars reference (which is so out of place I'd wish that Kevin Smith could come and smack Singer across the face).Here's my analogy for X-Men: Apocalypse: if you're the kind of person who likes to go to Burger King, and you haven't had a Whopper in a little while and you go to the local Burger King and get a Whopper that's been sitting around for half an hour - so it's not inedible for it's not cooked fresh - and you eat it and go ""Well, it's a Whopper,"" and don't ask them to cook you a fresh one and take what you've received and don't ask for anything else... well, you might be fine with this movie. But it's the textbook definition of a movie with a ton of great actors without a good story.Also, if you happen to love Oscar Isaac as he's one of the most magnetic personalities in American film right now... this is a stunning low for him as a character to play. He has NOTHING here, compared to this Poe Dameron in Star Wars is Michael Corleone as far as complexity goes.",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516
35,acinemafan,Very good movie,8/10,16 June 2016,"I don't understand why ""X-Men: Apocalypse"" received poor ratings. I found the movie to be very good. If you are a fan of the X-Men and/or enjoyed ""Captain America: Civil War"", you will likely enjoy this film.Instead of offering my own review, I am going to respond to the ""top critics"" from Rottentomatoes.com:""It's basically a closing chapter to a feeble trilogy that started out pretty well and then ran out of gas... Oscar Isaac wasted in the role of an invulnerable ancient supervillain who becomes vulnerable just in time for the final showdown."" Andrew O'Hehir (Salon.com) Clearly this critic is biased against the comic, for he refers to it as a ""feeble trilogy"". And if he paid attention (and didn't look forward to his scathing review), he would've seen that Apocalypse was not vulnerable, but a ""back door"" access was made to begin defeating him via Jean Grey in his mind (something that wasn't possible earlier in the film).""Mutants galore infest ""X-Men: Apocalypse,"" but the pile-on quickly becomes wearying....but the storyline, such as it is, would have benefited from major pruning."" Peter Rainer (ChristianScienceMonitor) A pile-on of mutants? There are possible three additional mutants added, with only one being introduced for the first time (Nightcrawler). Inclusion shouldn't be an issue, it's time taken for backstories that become clutter. And, ""pruning""? This is a very simple story, only the characters are given a little more dimension beyond simple cartoon characters. And my response to Rainer, applies to Peter Travers of Rolling Stone magazine, as well (""Enough already. Singer throws so much mutant at us that nothing sticks. I was almost rooting for Trump to impose a quota."") Jean Grey, Cyclops, Mystique, Quicksilver, and Nightcrawler, with the last one being the only new character (though, he did appear previously). Mr. Travers, the movie is not called, ""X-Man,"" and per your complaint, like O'Hehir from Salon.com, it appears you don't like this comic series. Well, I could go on, but, you get the point. The story is good -- and not convoluted. The acting is good. And, of course, the directing is good. If you liked the other ""X-Men"" movies, you like this one. And, personally, I found this one better than ""Days of Future Past"", which was a bit convoluted for my taste.",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516
36,Genti25,Good and interesting all the way through,9/10,28 July 2016,"X -Men: Apocalypse is a superhero film and the ninth installment on the X-Men film series. It is directed by Brian Singer with a screenplay by Simon Kinberg. It stars James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence, Oscar Isaac, Nicholas Hoult, Rose Byrne, Tye Sheridan, Sophie Turner, Olivia Munn and Lucas Till. In Apocalypse, the ancient mutant En Sabah Nur awakens in 1983 and plans to wipe out modern civilization and take over the world, leading the X-Men to try to stop him and defeat his team of renegade mutants. I personally loved this movie from beginning to the end. I started to get emotionally invested from the Magneto scene in the woods, and from then on it was just a thrill ride. The acting is absolutely great from everyone, starting with the always amazing Michael Fassbender, who is exceptional on the role as always. The newcomers all do a really good job with the stand out, Sophie Turner who definitely does not disappoint in the iconic role. Apocalypse, played by Oscar Isaac who is taking over the world by storm (in this movie quiet literally), looks really good on screen, and the acting by Oscar is fine and serviceable. What irritated me the most were the special effects, which certainly could and should have been better. Even First Class had better effects than Apocalypse, I mean it's not all bad, there are scene that are great to look at but sometimes it just lost me on all the obvious green screen. The music is undeniably good though, the main theme is great and memorable. It does also feel a bit too long, especially with all the leading up scenes, but overall this is a really well made and absolutely fun entry in the X-Men franchise. The new trilogy, First Class, Days of Future Past and Apocalypse, is most certainly one of the best superhero trilogies there are.",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516
37,Chalice_Of_Evil,X-ceptionally flawed...,7/10,7 August 2022,"This movie's all about 'out with the old/in with the new', starting with James McAvoy taking over Patrick Stewart's voiceovering duties. In ancient Egypt, En Sabah Nur's old/dried-up body's getting the boot as his consciousness is transferred into a new vessel (Oscar Isaac). Evidently, protestors are just as annoying/much of a nuisance back then as they are today, wanting to disrupt the Four Horsemen of the Apolcaypse's ceremony as they endeavor to protect their leader...but because they suck, they're easily defeated (even whilst possessing neat powers such as folding people like origami). Luckily, good ol' reliable Death manages to place a protective shield around Smurfpocalypse (after the transfer's completed) before he's buried underneath rubble until future idiots inevitably revive his blue arse.While some may've loved the journey-through-human-history that makes up this movie's opening credits sequence, I myself found it a bit much (everything zips by SO fast you can hardly follow what's appearing onscreen). The WTF-ery begins with a young Angel (no, not the dragonfly-winged-one-played-by-Zoë Kravitz...she *dead*, remember? The *other* one) CAGEFIGHTING young Nightcrawler (yes, REALLY. I guess DoFP's timey-wimeyness is to blame for why Angel's completely different to The Last Stand's version) until human-looking Raven/Mystique (clearly J-Law renegotiated her contract to have her appearing in blue scaled back), wearing a booby purple dress, liberates her fellow blue mutant after Angel's wings get singed.Unlike her First Class introduction, Moira MacTaggert's (returning so the issue of Charles wiping her memory can *finally* be addressed) the MOST-clothed she can possibly be as she witnesses worshippers revive Smurfpocalypse (told ya!), causing an earthquake everywhere, which leads to Erik/Magneto (who's laying low/living regular-person life with a boring wife and kid) saving a colleague at work by using his power...and soon the cops are after him. In a scene mirroring his own separation from his parents, Erik's daughter displays her power (summoning birds to attack). His obviously-doomed-from-the-start family prove super-unlucky, both getting offed with a single arrow (the cops were actually smart enough *not* to have any metal on them...though that doesn't do them much good, since Erik takes them all out using his dead daughter's necklace).Erik's not the only one having a sucky day, as young Scott/Cyclops unintentionally manifests his powers at school...giving it a new sunroof. The WTF-ery continues with a young Storm (just when you thought her hair couldn't get worse...she's got a mohawk), who's a thief, taking Smurfpocalypse HOME with her like he's a stray dog (despite witnessing the messed-up stuff he does to people), introducing him to TV...which is how he 'learns' about humanity, and she's the first in his recruitment of a new Four Horsemen, soon followed by Psylocke (the sum-total of her unexplained powers we see is a glowing pink sword and whip), Angel (whose burned/broken wings are replaced with new blade-shooting metal ones. They should've named him 'Archangel' to avoid confusion with the previous versions) and Magneto, who's now p.o.'d at the world after his family's demise.Meanwhile, Scott's brought to Xavier's school by his older brother Alex/Havok (who, like Storm, sports some seriously questionable hair), he meets young Jean Grey (GoT's Sophie Turner, only succeeding about *half* the time at sounding American. Two things you can always rely on from the X-films: dodgy hair and accents) and then, along with Nightcrawler and Jubilee, they go to see Return of the Jedi...which leads to the writers' attempt at self-referential humour regarding movies (was Jean's line about how 'the third one is always the worst' intended to warn us about *this* movie's quality?). Fortunately, they're away from the X-Mansion when Smurfpocalypse and his B-team of Horsemen invade. Unfortunately, foolish Havok (not listening to Charles) gets himself/the X-Mansion blown up.Fortunately, Evan Peters' Quicksilver happens by at the exact right moment, rescuing everyone (well...except Havok, of course, who's no longer needed now Scott's around). Clearly this slow-mo/super-speed sequence is intended to replicate the one from DoFP (which, unlike most, I wasn't particularly impressed by). Prior to Havok's immolation, Charles ordered him to 'wreak havoc' (in a rather forced attempt to have their own ""Hulk? Smash."" moment), destroying Cerebro when, once again, the villain intended to use it for EVIL (by now Cerebro's about neck-and-neck with the X-Jet for which one's been sabotaged/destroyed the most). When that fails, Smurfpocalypse simply has his Horsemen kidnap Charles (so he can amplify his power/connection to everyone and control them). They then proceed to mostly stand around/do nothing until the film's climax.Sadly, Mystique doesn't kick much butt (just gets strangled), so it's up to the new crew to handle the Boresome Foursome and Smurfpocalypse, who is the only real match for them, growing HUGE at one point during a Battle-of-the-Minds with Charles, thoroughly thrashing him after a failed attempt to make him the new vessel (causing his hair loss in the process...as apparently baldness is a prerequisite for the role) until Jean *finally* lets loose her 'Phoenix Force', making short work of Smurfpocalypse (maybe next time LEAD with that!). Angel's dead, Psyclocke skulks off, and Storm's welcomed into the X-Mansion (despite aiding the enemy), which Jean rebuilds with Erik's help (the last exchange between him and Charles is just their dialogue from the end of the first film being reused/recycled), then Mystique gives a pep-talk to the newly-formed team of young X-Men now dressed in what resembles their comic-book costumes.Speaking of costumes, Olivia Munn looks good in her boob-windowed outfit (oh sure, NOW you go for comic-book accuracy!), but like the majority of the new actors (whose performances range from average to pretty bad, while the returning actors seem to have lost enthusiasm) in the movie, her character's hardly developed. While nobody can ever equal Alan Cumming's Nightcrawler, I felt Kodi Smit-McPhee did the best out of the new additions taking over previously-established roles. Despite the film's attempted 'epic-ness', it mainly feels like a bunch of random/questionable ideas (including extraneous Wolverine cameos) thrown together. Oh well, if nothing else, at least they gave us plenty of boob...I mean blue!",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516
38,cosmo_tiger,Tops the previous one in every way possible. This series is close to as brilliant and classic as the Dark Knight trilogy.,10/10,13 June 2016,"""Some believe that the first mutant was born thousands of years ago. He was some kind of god, and he's going to rise again."" Years after the events of the last movie the X-Men members have gone their own way and are no longer the group they once were. Eric (Fassbender) is living life quietly in Poland with a wife and daughter. Charles is still running the school and training new students every day. Things are going smooth until an ancient evil is awoken and the future of the world is threatened. Once again the X-Men must band together to save the world, but this time things get complicated because Eric is fighting against them. After watching Days of Future Past I said that they should end this franchise. The time line aspect was so perfectly done and I felt that any further movie would ruin what was done. I have really like the Newer X-Men movies and even though I thought they shouldn't have made more I still went to see this one. Once again I have to admit that I was wrong. I loved First Class and didn't know how they could do better, and they did with Days of Future Past. This one tops both of those as well. The movie is funny, tense, has a strong grip on reality while still being a comic book movie. The cast is so perfect in this and the new additions are seamlessly added and really add to the feel and excitement. It is very hard for a series to consistently top itself but this one pulls it off perfectly. The sequel curse seems to be missing this series all together. Do yourself a favor and watch this today. Overall, once again, this movie tops the previous one in every way possible. This series is close to as brilliant and classic as Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy. I give this an A+.",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516
39,dfranzen70,"Not dull, but way too convoluted and busy",7/10,15 June 2016,"The latest in the ever-growing X-Men franchise, X-Men: Apocalypse (2016, **) is generally okay. There are several problems with it that will be noticed by even someone who's just vaguely familiar with the characters. There are too many story lines and too many characters. There are plot holes. The plot is also staggeringly familiar. Continuity with the earlier films is almost nonexistent.It's all about the first (apparently) mutant, En Sabah Nur (Oscar Isaac). We meet up with him in ancient Egypt as he's somehow transferring his consciousness into a new body, seeing as how his current one's decrepit. Then there's a rebellion, the transference doesn't quite take, and everyone's buried under rock and sand for centuries. Until the present, when an undercover CIA agent (don't ask) wanders to a subterranean lair in Cairo but doesn't cover up the entrance with a carpet, thus allowing the sun to come in and revive En Sabah Nur, who then proceeds to kill people with his mind and recruit mutants.Meanwhile! In eastern Europe, Magneto, I mean Eric Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender) is living the simple life as a factory worker with a doting wife and a little girl, which certainly means bad things will happen, as they do. (This is set after he tried to kill the president but was stopped by Mystique.) Short story long, Magneto flips the heck out, has a crisis of conscience, kills people, and flees. But not before shouting, ""What do you want from me?"" to the heavens. He's recruited by En Sabah Nur (who, by the way, is the Apocalypse of the title). En Sabah Nur's plan is to destroy Earth and build a new society, in other words the same as countless other villains.And because En Sabah Nur is such a strong mutant, he's able to get into the mind of one Charles Xavier – manipulate him, in fact. Which allows En Sabah Nur to find all the mutants he needs, and which also gives director Bryan Singer a chance to bring out a plethora of X-characters, like Storm, Psylocke, Cyclops, Beast, Angel, Havoc, Mystique (of course), and Jean Grey. Most of these characters were in earlier X-Men movies, but now they're all different ages. I don't mean different just from the other movies, I mean different relative to each other. Like in an earlier movie, two characters might be about the same age, and here they're suddenly a generation or so apart.X-Men: Apocalypse isn't dull, but it's way too convoluted for the franchise. It's almost as if no one thought there'd be any more of these films after this one, so they had to cram everyone in. The result – too many characters; a winding, tortuous plot; story lines with no real resolution; and general incoherence. It's a kitchen sink approach that just never works. Some actors fare well, such as Nicholas Hoult as Beast and Evan Peters as Quicksilver (who, incidentally, has the best scene in the movie, hands down). Some mail it in, like McAvoy and Jennifer Lawrence (Mystique). Some try their best, like Isaac and Fassbender. And some seem ill-equipped and over their heads, like Sophie Turner, who plays the indomitable (but young) Jean Grey. Turner is really wooden.",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516
40,lnvicta,"Grounded in its storytelling while gorgeous in its pandemonium, Apocalypse is yet another winner from Bryan Singer.",7/10,11 June 2016,"While I prefer First Class and Days of Future Past, Apocalypse truly surprised me. It has the grandest scale of any X-Men movie, and possibly of any superhero movie period. It revolves around the first mutant born tens of thousands of years ago, En Sabah Nur, hailed as an all-powerful god in Egypt before a mutiny in the ranks caused his pyramid to collapse, burying him in the process. Fast forward to the '80s and we see Moira MacTaggert (Rose Byrne) investigating a cult following of this mysterious mutant. Unbeknownst to her, only the smallest amount of sunlight was needed to awaken En Sabah Nur who subsequently causes an earthquake that is felt across the globe. The beginning of this movie is slow, and rightfully so. It shows the origin of Apocalypse, at least how he came to be trapped for all these millennia, and proceeds to show the individual X-Men characters in their respective settings. Magneto has a wife and child, Mystique is rescuing captured mutants like Nightcrawler and Angel, and Professor Xavier is teaching classes in his school. Soon enough, Scott Summers enrolls in the academy and meets Jean Grey. This sounds like a lot to cram into a movie, and it is, but this background was necessary as a foundation for the story to build upon, and boy does it ever.Apocalypse is one of those villains that has only one goal: world domination. Has it been done a thousand times before? Absolutely. Has it been executed as well as this? Probably not. If there was ever a practical motive for a villain to want to push the reset button on Earth, this is it. The guy's name is freaking Apocalypse and was hailed as a god in his time, and having seen how corrupt the world has become, he believes it's time for some new leadership. He has a huge ego and even huger powers to boot. He recruits some mutants, including Storm, Angel, Psylocke, and eventually Magneto, to help fulfill his global extinction plan, and it's exactly as destructive as it sounds. This might be the most catastrophic and destruction-filled action I've ever seen in a superhero movie. Cities crumble into dust, the Earth itself collapses from the inside, every nuclear warhead launches simultaneously across the world. It's pure pandemonium.The acting is superb across the board. There's no need praising McAvoy or Fassbender as they've proved themselves many times over. The newcomers are the real shockers here, especially Scott Summers played by Tye Sheridan and Jean Grey played by Sophie Turner. Both are brilliant in their roles and have great chemistry in the scenes they share. Oscar Isaac is excellent as Apocalypse. The material he's given is fairly vanilla but he pulls it off with both charisma and restraint, acting exactly how you'd expect a ten thousand year old god to act in the modern age. And the guy is just menacing to look at. He has a magnetic, commanding presence, and suitably so, being the most powerful villain ever put to screen. Evan Peters kills it as Quicksilver yet again and is given more screen time, plus another show-stealing scene for the fans of his DoFP debut. It's a large cast but it never feels unbalanced. The characters that need to shine do indeed shine, and even the background characters have their rightful place in the movie. It wasn't cluttered like it could have been. Rather, some of the best scenes in the movie are quiet character building moments.This was officially the last straw for me in regards to the credibility of critic scores. Just because it's not as good as Civil War doesn't make it a bad movie, and their criticisms of ""a cliché villain"" and ""underwritten characters"" are asinine and nitpicky. We needed a villain like this. Galactus was the closest we got to an apocalyptic villain but he was raped, mutilated, and morphed into a fart cloud in The Silver Surfer. It's about damn time we get a guy literally called Apocalypse to bring the world down to its knees. The characters are ""underwritten"" only in the sense that they don't spend twenty minutes going through each of their backstories and that's because they didn't have to. The movie captures their unique personalities and quirks within five minutes of them being on screen.X-Men: Apocalypse isn't a perfect movie but it's the epitome of a great summer blockbuster. The visuals are stunning, the chaos is immense, the humor is well placed, the pacing is spot on, the music is great (Metallica and Beethoven anyone?), and the entire film builds up to an explosive climax that delivers everything you'd want in an X-Men movie of this magnitude. If you're a fan of superhero movies, do yourself a favor and take the critic scores with a grain of sand. This is a must-watch.",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516
41,exlana,"not like what i expected , but still good",9/10,6 June 2016,"I don't get all the hate towards this movie. X-Men Apocalypse went really really slow , I admit that. And almost half first of the movie there barely something happened. But it's kinda necessary to built a background story to the character,which it should take a little longer because 45 minutes is not enough and make it kinda ""rush it"" because the story happened 10 years after the previous movie and I must tell you it's not really boring at all. There are some few ""funny"" scenes in this movie , although some of it maybe will make you cringe. I guess Bryan Singer kinda playing it safe because of what happened to all the hate towards BvS movie for being too ""serious"" and ""without"" humor. I guess these times you can't really make super hero movie without a funny scene.The visual effects is superb , as usual. The fighting scenes is also cool. Probably the down low about this movie is that it has a really interesting plot with something different in it which kinda cool but there's a few minor clichés and some irrelevant secene. It's really worth the watch , especially because it's visually cool and it's kinda different than any other superhero movie.",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516
42,dave_maguire,A decent entry but not without it's faults,5/10,4 June 2016,"So after loving DOFP, circumstances (eg: Holiday)caused me to have to wait several weeks after the release date to watch this movie and before showtime I had heard mixed reviews, but with most of them leaning towards a poor one I went in without any expectations so that I may avoid any potential disappointments. Now firstly let me say I wasn't disappointed, I found this film to be a decent enough entry in to the Xmen universe, certainly better than some other notable entries (Origns - I'm talking to you...). There was lots in this film that I liked, mostly as it seemed more loyal to the cartoon I watched back in my youth that I loved so much. There were plenty of characters involved in the film, comic book style action sequences and the always fun quicksilver scene, such a welcome addition to the xmen movies, and something that maybe points out one thing Marvel have done wrong with a character in their films... The Weapon X ""cameo"" - I enjoyed this but think it would have been so much better had they not spoilt this in the trailer, it fitted well with the story and you knew you were going to Alkali lake so it would've been nice to have had the anticipation of whether you would see Wolverine, but it was done well done and I liked that this was all we saw of him. Now I like the Wolverine character but personally felt that the original trilogy suffered due to an overdose of Wolverine, yes he was the main character of the first films but none of the other characters got developed which I felt made the films suffer, this is why I liked that Cyclops had a much more prominent role in this film and enjoyed that it seemed to focus more on him and Jean Grey and his rise to becoming a leader of the X-men.Now this wasn't the perfect film and there were bad points that I found to it. The pacing of the film was a little strange at times, it was a shame that Havok's death seemed to be almost glossed over ""He was closest to the explosion"" ""Oh, I thought I got everyone"" ..... ""Oh well, never mind...!"" Bit of a shame as we never got to see the ""Bad ass"" he was made out to be in the previous outings. Speaking of deaths I did have a sneaky feeling there may be another one in the film and almost expected Mystique to die in the final battle, especially with her being built up as a hero all the way through the film, but then wondered if Quicksilver might perish when taking on Apocalypse on by himself - in another fantastic sequence, but this was not the case.Whilst it was good to see a big cast, The horsemen seemed to just be ""there"" and with the exception of Storm (slightly) were not fleshed out - Angel is seemingly built up as some seasoned warrior and is introduced with a cage fight scene having just beaten the blob and having gone 10 fights undefeated (Which we don't see any of) before he meets nightcrawler where he promptly gets his ""ass handed to him"". Even in the rematch at the end of the film he still struggles to put up any kind of fight. Psylocke was just sat in a room with Caliban evidently as his bodyguard, and for no real reason just decides to join Apocalypse, though this may be to save Calibans life?? But it would've been nice to have spent a little more time giving them some character - especially in a 2 & 1/2 film.My biggest problem though which I had ever since he was announced was Oscar Issac as Apocalypse. Whilst I have no problem with him as an actor I just never saw him as being that character and wasn't convinced of him at any point through the film. Apocalypse is a hugely overpowered mutant who has a deep booming voice and should be menacing and instil fear in to those he meets, yet Issacs is tiny and had too much of a softly spoken voice in the film and I just found he didn't fit the part at all., he just looked like one of the gang when stood with his horsemen. Now whilst I'm not saying he should've had the part instead, I think someone like the Rock, with his build, would've been more visually suited to the character, but that's just my opinion.Whilst this does almost wrap the whole Xmen story up I do hope there is another one after this, they have after all teased the Phoenix saga again so can see this being the next big thing, though I think the next film will be too soon for this story to resolve as it will need fleshing out more first, but the end credit scene leaves a couple of potential movies, with a potential creation of X-23, or hopefully Mr Sinister as the next big bad. But overall it's a good enough entry and I don't think it's as bad as some people have said, it's certainly not worthy of the 1's and 2's out of 10 that some people have given it??? But again it's the nods to the comics and cartoons which I liked about the films, with the scene at the end with the team in their cartoon costumes in the training room a brilliant way to end the film.",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516
43,JPfanatic93,"Something old, something new",7/10,1 June 2016,"'Third one is always the worst' says Jean Grey when leaving the theater after watching Return of the Jedi back in '83. She was right about that one, and conscious or unconscious (I doubt the writer intended for this movie to be the weakest in the second X-trilogy), she's also correct about X-Men: Apocalypse. However, also like Return of the Jedi, Apocalypse still is a whole lot of mutant fun for those who didn't expect the franchise to reach new heights anyway.Granted, it's not the story that provides the mirth, since it's the stuff of repetition, variations on themes and lack of narrative evolution. Basically, another all-powerful mutant rears his head and threatens to destroy the world for mankind so that its stronger successors can take over. And once again, the X-Men, fighting for peace between man and mutant, must get together to stop this megalomaniacal scheme from becoming reality. This time, it's not Magneto who has hatched the diabolical plan, but rather a 5,000 year old ideological predecessor, an ancient Egyptian once worshiped as a god, with the modern moniker Apocalypse. Magneto, once more masterfully performed by Michael Fassbender, merely provides some muscle to help Oscar Isaac's semi-god with his evil shenanigans. Isaac does a decent job playing an age old villain, but he's no Fassbender and his Apocalypse is nowhere near as intimidating or intriguing as the much more relatable Magneto.Still, the villain suffices for the cause of bringing together two generations of X-Men, the First Class lot and the new batch of young recruits, including novel takes on classic X-characters Cyclops, Jean Grey and Nightcrawler. Their performances and their chemistry make us hopeful for the future of the franchise, should the studio feel like using them for the next installment Apocalypse seems to be building up to. For although it's meant as a conclusion to a trilogy, the ground work is amply laid for more to come and these young stars succeed in making us curious about what lies ahead. The new additions to the cast are aided by snappy dialogue and light humour, making the shortcomings in the plot not nearly as blatant as they would have been in lesser hands. Nevertheless, it's clear director Bryan Singer, who has made his fourth X-movie with this title, has run out of ideas for the X-universe. Though we appreciate his work on both trilogies, new blood would be equally welcome in the creative room as it proved in the cast.",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516
44,palavitsinis,It's goooood!,8/10,2 June 2016,"Have been reading quite some reviews before deciding to write my own. My opinion? I think that this one was probably one of the best X-Men movies of all time. I mean, if you take out the first one that I watched when I was half my age now and I was amazed by it, I think the others are pretty much below this one. I read comments about the CGI, the costumes, etc. I am all for it. I also agree that the X-Men franchise has been struggling a lot with costumes and effects, more than someone would expect. I mean, we have seen nice CGI elsewhere that also looked as realistic as they can get (Deadpool for one). I can't understand why they can't make Psylocke look real when she is running on that rooftop in the final battle. This was disappointing as hell. And of course, it seems like Mystique was better off with CGI and not with this weird costume that looks like it came out of a cheap rental for Halloween. Other than that, the movie had the funny element, albeit not that much as avengers or deadpool of course, but it was nicely made. I completely digged the story about the first mutant and I liked it a lot (would be amazing to have this in ancient Greece, no?). The cast was good in their roles, although I would like to see someone else as Jean Grey. Sophie Turner did a great job but I think her looks just wasn't enough for me. I think that the previous Jean Grey cannot be surpassed. The scenario was really good also but I felt at times that the movie was too much spread out all over the place. Maybe keeping things more tight would be better for the movie. Overall, it had so much material that the easiest thing to do is to find loose ends. But that's beyond the point of such movies. For example, I also didn't like the fact that they magically build the house back and I don't think that their powers allow them to do such things, but anyways, I won't sit down and nag about the plausibility of such thing in a superhero movie!Looking at the movie afterwards, you can say lots of things and really go into details and miss the essence. My feeling while seeing it was that this is 8.5/10. I can't give halves, so I bump it down to 8 cause 9 seems too much. Apart from one or two scenes, I was truly immersed and I enjoyed every part. And of course, the nice connection in the end with the next movie was worth waiting for. This was a nicely done movie and it would be rated even higher if it wasn't so closely released with Deadpool or Civil War.",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516
45,paul_haakonsen,Witness the Apocalypse...,7/10,17 September 2016,"Normally I am not overly keen on superhero movies, but still do get around to watch them in order to have seen them and also to be entertained for whatever worth they should have. However, I will say that the 2016 ""X-Men: Apocalypse"" was somewhat of a surprise to me; a surprise in a good way.The story told in ""X-Men: Apocalypse"" was captivating from the very beginning and it kept being interesting right up to the end of the movie. So the entertainment value in this movie was quite good. However, how true it is to the X-Men comic book universe, I have no idea.This is a movie with a good story, but it is helped along immensely by a myriad of spectacular effects. The effects in this movie was off the charts, and in my opinion it really bore the movie a long distance.The acting in ""X-Men: Apocalypse"" was good, and it is nice to see actors and actresses who portrayed characters in previous movies make a return to portray them once again. In my opinion, then the most memorable performance in this movie was done by Michael Fassbender (playing Erik Lehnsherr / Magneto) and Oscar Isaac (playing En Sabah Nur / Apocalypse).I am hoping to see more of Psylocke in future movies, as I do remember that she was my favorite character when I was reading the comic books as a young kid. And having Olivia Munn to portray Psylock in the movie was a good thing, because she really fit the role quite well and did a great job. Just a shame that she didn't have more time on the screen.I don't really care much about superhero abilities and such, but for as long as the movie is entertaining, I will endure and watch it. And I was more than genuinely entertained by ""X-Men: Apocalypse"". I will actually go as far as saying that it is the best of the X-Men movies to date.",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516
46,me_theuninvited,"After 16 years, Bryan Singer delivers the X Men movie we've all been waiting for!",10/10,12 May 2016,"I am horrified by the people on the message boards here on this movie's threads. They're fighting each other like a bunch of hungry animals. Since when does everyone started listening to the critics? I mean, yes, to have an idea before watching a movie is good, but that's not the case these days. Critics are taking movies way too seriously these days. It's just a source of entertainment. Your life does not depend on it. Stop bad mouthing this movie for others. Okay, sorry for my rant but this has gotten out of control. Now getting back to the movie, let's just say it delivered what it promised. This movie was amazing. It really felt like you were watching something Apocalyptic. Although I don't have had a problem with Bryan Singer's X Men movies, unlike a bunch of whiny babies, this one actually felt like it was an X Men movie. A sheer resemblance of what we saw in X Men cartoons, both evolution and the 1990 ones. We actually saw the main characters of this movie in their mutant form. I have loved how Bryan always preferred acting over action in his other movies, but this one, it consists of both. I have also seen critics saying that this movie is complete CGI. Well it's not like you can do actual Apocalyptic level scenes without having any CGI effects. That's just crazy. And the CGI in this movie is beyond awesome. I already smell an Oscar for CGI for this movie. Oscar Isaac was so impressive in this movie. Even though he was buried under make up and what not, you could actually feel his performance. Michael and James once again give awesome performances. Expected nothing less from Jennifer Lawrence. At least these movies actually give spotlight to the female actresses *cough* *Marvel* *cough*. The new actors were great. So talented. Tye, Sophie, Alexandra, Kodi and of course Evan Peters were all good in their respective roles. This movie might feel a different because of it's whole world at stake thing. This is the first time X Men has done this, and they succeed really good at it. It had a perfect balance of action, humor, emotion and mutants. It was like watching a live action version of those X Men cartoons we grew up watching. Once again, please dear my friends, who would love to see these guys in MCU, it's not happening anytime soon. Let's just get over it, okay? The producer of these movies has already announced a bunch of new movies under Fox. There are X Men TV shows coming out soon, so let us enjoy these while you guys enjoy yours okay?",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516
47,caseynicholson,A Good (But Not Great) Chapter in the X-Men Saga,7/10,2 June 2016,"I've been a fan of the X-Men since I first read the ""Age of Apocalypse"" comics in the mid-90's, and as such I was intrigued by this film. I've of course seen all of the X-Men movies leading up to this point, which put me at an advantage over someone who wanders into this film blind.This is a reasonably good movie. The whole Egyptian element of Apocalypse's background and the setting for much of the film doesn't really work for me (it makes for a strange hybrid between comics and Egyptian mythology, in my view), but the movie is faithful to its source material in this regard. Similarly, the story is a bit convoluted, but that, too, is something that has precedence in the comic books.That said, there's much to like about this movie, from its reasonably good acting and its well done CGI effects, along with a good script overall. This is not a bad movie, by any stretch.However, there is something about this film that is hard to articulate that is simply bothersome. My biggest problem with the X-Men franchise at this stage is that it has become hackneyed. The previous installment, ""Days of Future Past"", reset much of the story's timeline so that a new generation of actors could bring us new stories to the big screen, which is great--the new cast is off to a nice start.And yet, this film feels very much like a direct sequel to ""X-Men: First Class"", a film which is itself five years old this year. And ""Apocalypse"" features so many references to previous films (including a clever self-deprecating dig at ""Last Stand"") that the movie takes on the feel of the latest chapter in a t.v. series more so than a feature length film. That serial nature of this film, and others in the series, is both the franchise's trademark feel and yet also takes away from the individual films as standalone movies.All this said, I'm going to give this movie 7/10 stars. It's well made and fun--a good popcorn movie, as they say. But it's not outstanding. Worth seeing if you're an X-Men fan or a comic book fan in general, but not mandatory viewing for those who are just fans of good movies, period.",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516
48,one9eighty,An epic film and a fitting tribute to the comic,9/10,19 May 2016,"I really really really enjoyed this movie, I remember sitting in the cinema watching it thinking ""I need to watch this again, quickly!"" This was a roller-coaster of film which did justice to both the comic world and the world of film, and that's something I haven't said about other comic inspired films much. This is the best of the X-Men films, even better than ""Days of Future Past"" which took some doing, because that was previously the best of them. If I'm honest, the reboot/ new timeline has done the X-Men franchise the world of good, the films are bigger, better and darker - something the X-Men definitely deserves. I personally think they are partly responsible for the success the current MCU and DCU are having. This is the 4th superhero/comic film of the year, I personally think this is better than ""Batman vs Superman"" and ""Cpt. America: Civil War"". As an immersing spectacle to tantalize the senses this is on par, for me, with the ""Deadpool"" film, and I really enjoyed that, but for different reasons. The film was set in the 80's and delivers for the actual time period with feelings of fear and nuclear war, as well as the colour and the sound of 80's fashion and popular culture. It also delivers on the feeling of early X-Men comics, fear of mutants and man's need to control them, with characters looking to find and understand themselves and what they are capable of.Brian Singer directs and has used the new timeline created in ""X- Men: Days of Future Past"" to wonderful effects to weave a great story. The film introduces En Sabah Nur, or Apocalypse, the first mutant, woken from a deathly slumber about thousands of years. Events transpire that allow him to enlist his regular 4 horsemen to serve him and bring down humanity. His aim is to cleanse the world of the weak (humans and anyone that opposes him generally) and build the world again with him as it's ruler. Standing in his way are the X-Men, who themselves have journeys and story's unfolding at he same time. I don't want to spoil anything so that's as far as I'm taking the synopsis. The cast is brilliant and believable throughout, not just can they act but as an Englishman it's nice to see a Brit heavy cast delivering sublimely. Established characters as well as new appearances make great showings, nobody seemed out of place here. The emotional variances and deliveries were brilliant throughout, giving you everything from love to tragedy, fear to fascination, comedy to conflict. The action scenes were top notch and suited the characters in the film very well. With each unique character, a different power, and each variant is acted and delivered with class. Sometime the CGI and cabled action shots were a little obvious and overdone, but it was still damn fine eye candy and didn't ruin things. It actually served to offer the comic book physics that I'd expect. The film isn't afraid to set up a story at over two hours but it didn't drag at any point, I couldn't wait for more to happen and I certainly look forward to more X-Men films like this one. Stay tuned for the usual post-credits scene, if you know the MCU and X- Men comics you'll figure out who might be pulling some strings in the next movie and like me you'll be ready and waiting.

49,TheLittleSongbird,Uneven but not bad,6/10,29 May 2016,"Ranking 'X Men: Apocalypse' alongside the other X Men films, it's for me third weakest. Better than 'Last Stand' and 'Origins' (though even they had merits), but not in the same ball park as 'X Men 2', 'First Class' and especially 'Days of Future Past' (also preferred the solid if yet-to-find-its-feet-feel first film) and only just slightly under 'The Wolverine.' There is a lot to like about 'X Men: Apocalypse'. It looks great, being very slickly filmed and photographed, production design being grittily atmospheric yet audacious, smoothly edited and with effective costumes and make-up. The special effects are of extremely good quality too, the much applauded big Quicksilver scene being particularly note worthy, and there is not an overload or underuse of them. John Ottman makes a welcome return to the series and his score is one of the more memorable and fitting (with that for 'Days of Future Past' getting first prize for the most) of the series since 'X Men 2'. The script provokes thought and doesn't make the mistake of rambling, while the action is dynamically choreographed, thrilling and emotionally charged on the whole.For effective scenes, highlights do have to be a suspenseful and very arresting opening sequence and particularly Quicksilver's super speed life-saving scene, which is one of the series' most jaw-dropping. The story starts off really well and is very diverting with anything with Magneto. There are some terrific performances here, James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender (whose character writing is the meatiest here) especially apply here and they make keep the story on point and from completely derailing. Sophie Turner shows off Jean Grey's conflicts and flaws very effectively and touchingly, while Evan Peters steals every scene as Quicksilver, Nicholas Hoult continues to be fine as Beast and Hugh Jackman makes a ferociously charismatic cameo.Was mixed on Oscar Isaac (heavily made-up and unrecognisable) and Bryan Singer's direction. Actually Isaac's performance as villain Apocalypse himself is pretty decent and effectively menacing, but it's the clichéd and underwritten way in which Apocalypse is written that prevents Isaac from doing anything that special with the character that stops me from feeling more. People have said that Apocalypse here is more Ivan Ooze-clone than the character of the comic book, and it's easy to see why they would think that, this said Isaac does do a good enough job with what he had. Singer is at home in the style and the action, but when it comes to making the characters and story completely interesting and giving depth to them he isn't quite as confident as he was before, competent and stylistically classy but a bit bland.'X Men: Apocalypse' suffers from being rather too overcrowded, with a fair bit going on and with lots of characters but effectiveness of executions varies wildly. Some good characterisation and great scenes, but a lack of constant dread and urgency and too many characters given short shrift, though nowhere near as badly as in 'Last Stand' and 'Origins'. The pacing is diverting at first but starts to drag once the plot gets more rambling and more bogged down by content. 'X Men: Apocalypse' includes comic relief and romance and they don't come off well, the comic relief is very goofy and at odds tonally with everything else and the romance is completely under-developed.Jennifer Lawrence clearly looks bored too in a complete waste of Mystique, and Olivia Munn is underused and basically just eye-candy in a role that has little depth to her if at all.In conclusion, uneven but still decent. 6/10 Bethany Cox",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516
50,TheOneThatYouWanted,"The 'Batman V Superman' of X-Men movies. (Yeah, it sucks that bad)",4/10,23 May 2016,"Just so you know where I'm coming from. I liked X-Men First Class and thought Days of Future Past was just okay. But this stinker is just bad. After 30 minutes I started looking at my watch and about an hour into the movie I wanted to walk out. Like Batman V Superman, this movie has just so much going on; it feels bloated. And did anyone else notice how bored Michael Fassbender looked in the movie? Michael Fassbender is the guy who plays Magneto and is usually an outstanding actor but he looked like he just didn't want to be there. Even during some of his emotional scenes he looks like he is just phoning it in. I'm guessing he is sick of playing the role. Anyway, the movie feels longer than it is and it isn't even watching it in theaters just for the action. And what is up with reminding us about Jennifer Lawrence's Mystique every five minutes? Even when she isn't on screen they literally show a picture or video of her. It isn't as stupid as watching Wonder Woman check her email but sh!t, the director should know better. Maybe the producers are to blame, I don't know. I just know that watching this stupid movie shouldn't feel like doing homework. This movie is a rental at best. Don't be fooled by the fanboys trying to act like the critics are wrong about this movie. I watched all of the X-Men movies and both of the spin off Wolverine movies and I'm going to straight up tell you, this movie is the worse of the lot. Does Quicksilver have a cool scene in the movie? Yes he does, but is it really worth watching a bad movie just to watch one scene? No, it isn't. Be smart and wait to watch it on a smaller screen. The only thing I liked about it was the last 2 minutes.",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516

While it was not in my opinion better than DOFP it still had a great story and lots of cool sequences. I am glad that they did not go overboard with this one like they did in The Last Stand. I think most people that like x-men well still think that it was a decent movie. Unless they just don't like the superhero thing. All the new actor and actress'd did a great job. There were though some parts in the movie that i thought should have gone by faster. Like some of the shots where a hero does something cool and we see him or her stand in glory is getting old and may have been over used in this film in my opinion. I liked the inclusion of history and the scenes with erik are my favorite.Micheal Fassbender stole the show for me again. As well as the new Scott and Jean Grey they did a marvelous job. There were some continuity issues that i saw with Storm but, whatever. Ill accept her accent for now. I do wish that i saw more from Olivia Munn's character, i felt like she was just there. I also wish they set up or fixed the passing of getting all the four horseman together.

52,littleging12,"The Critics are way Wrong! ""Apocalypse"" Delivers",8/10,9 June 2016,"The 8th installment of the X-men franchise (excluding ""Deadpool"") blasts off with this big-budgeted extravaganza featuring the long awaited super-villain Apocalypse. After the huge success of ""Days of Future Past,"" Bryan Singer gets another go at the franchise. The film successfully captures the spectacle, humor, heart, and awesomeness that filmgoers have come to expect from the X-men franchise further solidifying that Bryan Singer is THE MAN to direct the X-men movies.When ""X-men: Apocalypse"" was prescreened it became bombarded with negative reviews -- leaving many (myself included) skeptical of the film's potential. Though what critics do not seem to get is that yes, ""Apocalypse"" is flawed, although it still thoroughly entertained its audience from start to finish with awesome super-powered set pieces, thrilling action, delightful comic relief and cool cameos of beloved characters.The production team and the writers really made this film work. The performances were great from a very young and likable cast. The special effects were solid yet did rely a bit too much on CGI. The action was thrilling and provided audiences with tension through the threat of character deaths and other calamities present unlike in ""Civil War"" where there was not much tension in the action (albeit still cool) because most of the fights took place between friends who we knew would never kill each other. The humor was sporadic yet still funny. X-men always makes great use of their one f-word limit. Finally the nuke scene with the subtle touch of Beethoven and the Quicksilver scene with the Eurythmics' 'Sweet Dreams' were just simply exquisite.Now Apocalypse did have flaws. There is no denying that. The timeline still has inconsistencies and continuity errors. While watching Apocalypse the average moviegoer probably will spend a good amount of time figuring out if the years and ages line up correctly. Like no way Nicholas Hoult looks twenty years older than he did in ""First Class."" Rottentomatoes went so far to call Apocalypse (the villain) cliché. Which is partially true because he wanted to destroy the world; which is what every super-villain wants to do nowadays! Also another review on IMDb said that all the X-men team up to defeat Apocalypse (the villain) by combining their powers in a Fant4stic kind of way. That is very true and the scene did seem like a bland and anticlimactic approach to kill off the big bad Apocalypse. Also since X-men is known for having an abundance of superheroes present: giving each one sufficient development is a task too difficult. Given this, certain characters had no development or little to do like Storm, Angel, Jubilee, and Psylocke -- whose only purpose for being there was to make teenaged boys lose their sh...In a nutshell ""X-men: Apocalypse"" is another good addition to the X-men franchise that will continue to propel it forward in more ways than one. The production team did a great good of integrating action, emotional depth, resonant themes, and humor into a seamless whole. Hopefully the studio will keep Bryan Singer at the director's chair and if they even think about getting a new director, they just need to be reminded that the only good X-men movies came from him.",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516
53,matej-trkanjec-133-920386,"Unlike the other superhero movies, this one got it just right",7/10,4 June 2016,"In a year where most hated Batman v Superman (with few who actually saw how great it actually was), loved Civil Was (with the same few that saw all the problems it had), Apocalypse is a superhero movie that feels just about right, it is the superhero movie we have been waiting for this year.Unlike the trailers, the story is much more complex and dark. The trailers lead to different expectations so a pleasant surprise was found upon viewing. The villain is as comic book as he can get, his followers included. Apocalypse is by far the most fearsome enemy the X-men had so far. He is a type of villain you just love to watch and hear, and you hate him with every fiber of your being. Isaac's portrayal was superb. His godlike attitude and inhumane deprivation of every emotion was difficult to produce, but he succeeded nicely. Taking into account his godlike performance, the final battle simply keeps you stuck exactly where you're sitting, unable to move with a sense of not wanting this movie to end. The only problem is getting to the ending. The story does drag a bit in the middle, at points really unnecessary. Still, the movie's basic story line functions like a nice and compact structure.Other than that, the portrayal of Magneto was by far the best we have seen. Fassbender's deep understanding of the character leaves you wondering just how much time he spent in researching the character. Also, he managed to keep the character as close as he could to the original Ian McKellen performance.At this point, the true problem of the movie is revealed. There simply is not a leading man/woman. Lawrence was intended to be the leading role, but she never really takes full control. McAvoy does a great job again, but never really steps as the leading role. Also, a lot of young actors portraying younger versions of the X-men lead the second half of the movie. Maybe that is the reason why the second part drags a bit, they are still not up to the role of being leading stars (even though they have potential). So, basically, Isaacs as the villain took over. Was that a good choice is questionable, but the movie's functionality because of that is not doubted.The element that binds all this together is the music that follows scenes to a subatomic level. From the character suite's to the action scenes, the music was superbly done. Also, some humor elements really give this movie a lifelike dimension.All in all, is you loved the previous movies, you will adore Apocylpse. The problems are simple, a lot of characters with not one good guy in charge lead to a dragged second part of the movie. Still, it was performed brilliantly, technically nicely done with much more character development of Magneto, which lead to a darker tone of the movie. Apocalypse is a type of movie you will want to see over and over again, and every time you will find something brilliant, even if it's just how much fun you are having while watching it.P.s. If Suicide squad doesn't mess up, Apocalypse is this years greatest superhero movie.",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516
54,PWNYCNY,"Not a bad movie, overly long, some strong acting.",7/10,28 May 2016,"Simple plot, lots of special effects, predictable outcome. This is the formula that drives Hollywood movies today, and this movie is no exception. The movie contains strong acting, but that is totally upstaged by the immense use of special effects which gives the movie a cartoon-like character. As this movie is based on comic book characters, that should not be surprising. The premise of the story is a shaky one - humans divided into two subspecies, one mutant and the others normal. The cause of this division is not explained. For the story to be engaging, this division has to be accepted without question. Otherwise the entire story is meaningless and contrived. The movie offers two and a half hours of almost nonstop special effects. There is some character development which adds some substance to the plot, and makes the movie more watchable. But about two-thirds of the way into the movie, the story becomes rather tedious as it moves to its inevitable outcome. The problem with comic book characters is exactly that - they are comic book characters, and frankly, how emotionally invested can anyone really become in characters that by their very nature are pure fantasy?",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516
55,dave-mcclain,"""X-Men Apocalypse"" is technically masterful and fun to watch, but feels like too much of a good thing.",7/10,27 May 2016,"Call 2016 ""The Year of the Superhero Battles"". After the Caped Crusader and the Man of Steel went at each other in ""Batman v. Superman"" and the Avengers divided (then reunited) and conquered in ""Captain America: Civil War"", ""X-Men Apocalypse"" (PG-13, 2:24) features mutants fighting each other. They're fighting over a mutant's mutant named En Sabah Nur. But you can just call him Apocalypse. That name reveals this film's tie-in with another cinematic superhero trend of the 2010s – world domination. After the Avengers prevented a sentient A-I baddie named Ultron from destroying mankind and rebooting the world in 2015, an ancient mutant who is actually named for the end of the world tries to do the same in 2016. Or is it 1983? Heck, these movies' own characters have trouble keeping it all straight – even within the X-Men universe. In a meta reference in 2016's ""Deadpool"", as Colossus drags the title character across a bridge and says, ""You will come talk to Professor Xavier"", Deadpool understandably and hilariously responds, ""McAvoy or Stewart? These timelines can get so confusing.""I'll try to keep from confusing things further with my plot summary, by limiting character references for simplicity's sake. (To read more about who's in this movie, God has given us IMDb and Wikipedia.) In ""X-Men: Apocalypse"", a variety of human beings with special powers continues their magical mystery tour of the planet, as the supremely psychic mentor and do-gooder Professor Xavier (that's James McAvoy in this one, Mr. Pool) tries to bring out the good in all mutants - even the bad ones. Erik Lehnsherr / Magneto (Michael Fassbender) is trying to live a quiet country life in Poland when something happens that REALLY makes him mad and he's not inclined to be magnanimous towards his enemies. We then meet three other overseas mutants who are morally ambiguous and/or evil to varying degrees. We also see the sometimes-but-not-currently-blue-hued Raven Darkhölme / Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) traveling the world and recruiting (for Xavier's academy) young mutants like the teleporting Kurt Wagner / Nightcrawler (Kodi Smit-McPhee). Meanwhile, back at Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters in Westchester, New York, Professor X is working hard to help a growing number of resident mutants. They include the telekinetic Jean Grey / Phoenix (Sophie Turner) and Scott Summers / Cyclops (Tye Sheridan), whose eyes have just started shooting out extremely destructive laser beams. The Professor has help from the also sometimes-but-not-currently-blue-hued Hank McCoy / Beast (Nicholas Hoult), but X becomes distracted by the re-emergence of his memory-impaired old flame, CIA agent Moira MacTaggert (Rose Byrne), who is in Egypt investigating the legend of an ancient mutant, who's also part of this movie's 50 Shades of Blue.Back in ancient Egypt, about five and a half millennia ago (give or take a century), En Sabah Nur / Apocalypse (an unrecognizable Oscar Isaac) continued his habit of transferring his consciousness into the younger bodies of other mutants, and, in the process, adding their powers to his personal super power arsenal. When some mutant-haters betray him, and even his current generation of four helpers (later called ""The Four Horsemen"") can't save him, he's buried underneath a collapsed pyramid and forced to take a very, very, very long sand nap. As one summary of this movie has said, ""Fast-forward to 1983 (10 years after the mind-bending, time-travelling events in 'X-Men: Days of Future Past')."" Some present-day believers unearth the king of the mutants, utter some chants, and release En Sabah Nur into the modern world. He catches up on everything he has missed (and learns to speak English) by touching a TV set and immediately begins gathering another team of mutant minions. He has decided that mankind has gone astray without his guidance and he plans to wipe out nearly all humans (whether they're evil or not) – and he doesn't even provide any of them with an ark! This harsh latter-day Darwinist will only allow the strongest to survive, destroy everything man has made, and then rebuild. ""X-Men: Apocalypse"" is impressive and entertaining, but seems like a little too much of a good thing. Its visual effects, action set pieces and hair-make-up work, taken as a whole, represent the most creative and best executed that I've ever seen in a single movie. At first blush, those sets of accomplishments seemed destined for some serious awards season love (with more than a few wins). However, the film's extraordinary technical achievements are symptomatic of what's wrong with it. Although Movie Fans who are new to the X-Men franchise will be unable to appreciate the layered character development and the references to the previous films, the plot of this film does stand alone and isn't hard to follow. It's fun and awe-inspiring to watch but has too much going on. This movie naturally brings to mind previous X-Men installments, along with movies in which several (or all) of the Avengers appear. If this trend continues, Stan Lee himself (who, of course, has a brief cameo in this Marvel film, with his real-life wife) may have to develop a super power and pick up a shield or something.Come to think of it, I wonder if I'm the only one who would be interested to see Ultron and Apocalypse go up against each other. Of course, they'd both have to still be ""alive"" for that to happen, but the way the X-Men franchise plays fast and loose with timelines, anything is possible. Then there's the possibility that Ultron and Apocalypse, with their different but complementary skill sets and mutual penchant for destruction, could join forces. In that case, all the X-Men AND Avengers joining forces might still be unable to stop that dastardly duo. Even if such a battle were to be fought, the resulting movie (with cameras naturally there to capture every crash-bang-boom) would be even more cluttered than ""X-Men: Apocalypse"" which I'm giving a ""B+"".",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516
56,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Everyone's invited to the ""Apocalypse,"" a clunkier but still enjoyable ""X-Men"" film",7/10,21 January 2017,"After ""Days of Future Past"" bridged together the two generations of big screen X-Men into an epic time-travel blockbuster, it didn't leave a whole lot of ceiling for future ""X- Men"" movies. Nevertheless, 20th Century Fox, director Bryan Singer and writer Simon Kinberg were quick to deliver ""X-Men: Apocalypse,"" bringing the X-Men's biggest villain to life. ""Apocalypse"" takes place in the early '80s in the (cleverly) revised ""X-Men"" timeline. All is rather quiet on the mutant-human front: Professor X (James McAvoy) has the school up and running, Raven (Jennifer Lawrence) isn't getting into too much trouble and even Erik leads a peaceful new life in Poland. But when the ancient mutant En Sabah Nur a.k.a. Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac) is awakened from basically a really long nap, it has a seismic impact that sends the X-Men and humanity on a crash course for annihilation.A host of familiar characters return in the form of fresh young faces as the new ""X-Men"" universe inches closer to the first version. This includes Jean Gray (Sophie Turner), Scott Summers/Cyclops (Tye Sheridan) and Nightcrawler (Kodi Smit-McPhee) for the good guys and Angel (Ben Hardy), Psylocke (Oliva Munn) and even Storm (Alexandra Shipp) as mutants recruited by Apocalypse to serve as his ""horsemen,"" of which Magneto somewhat reluctantly becomes the fourth. Although ""Days of Future Past"" was pretty crowded with characters too, the story kept things compartmentalized and manageable, not to mention most of them had already been introduced in previous films. ""Apocalypse,"" however, must balance them all within one story, and it requires lots of little scenes that jump around from character to character. Kinberg does a better job at this than he did back when he wrote ""X-Men: The Last Stand,"" a movie he takes a not-so-subtle jab at in one random but funny scene, but the story becomes similarly unhinged.As an all-powerful villain bent on wiping the earth clean of non-mutants, Apocalypse has the potential to be both really intimidating and cause a number of plausibility issues. Both side of that coin come into play in ""Apocalypse,"" but neither side is particularly nuanced, so the intellectual component that the ""X-Men"" franchise has done very well at times practically no-shows here. Some emotion weaves its way into the movie to varying degrees of effectiveness, particularly in individual character side stories, but physicality, visual effects and spectacle end up at the forefront of the viewing experience.The script does a good job showcasing the many characters and their talents and figuring out how to close as many holes in logic as possible (i.e. ""if that characters does 'X' couldn't that other character use their powers to do 'Y'?"") and Singer makes those clashes compelling. He's always had a good vision for this franchise and keeps ""Apocalypse"" focused and engaging enough, even when the top has been blown off and the frame becomes 99 percent CGI in the final act. Most importantly, Singer always makes sure the characters don't get lost in the chaos, which makes ""Apocalypse"" definitively better than ""The Last Stand,"" even if it is probably Singer's poorest job of sticking to his mantra. In a series that's had a lot of high points, it's not hard for ""Apocalypse"" to default into one of the lesser ""X-Men,"" but it's completely watchable and satisfying.The future of ""X-Men"" on the silver screen is a bit hazy given contracts for its big stars, but ""Apocalypse,"" in all its mayhem, restores the equilibrium that offset by ""Days of Future Past"" and the ripple effect it had on the main characters. It was a good ripple, but future installments should be able to stand a bit more on their own from now on and that's a good sign.~Steven CThanks for reading!

58,slicedbread117,"Another Wonderful X-Men Film, With Untapped Potential to be Something Greater",8/10,6 June 2016,"X-Men: Days of Future Past was quite possibly one of the best superhero movies of all-time, and my personal favorite X-Men movie. With big footsteps to follow, X-Men: Apocalypse goes bigger and better in some aspects, and continues the franchise's path of success, but doesn't quite shine like some of its predecessors. Director and writer Bryan Singer has been able to craft some amazing stories in this growing X-Men universe, with spectacular character arcs spanning two separate main casts, and intense, intimate action steering the ship. The plot of Apocalypse gives an enticing premise, and a great story for longtime X-Men fans to love; the story of the world's first ever Mutant, the title character, and his eternal quest to rid Earth of mankind to build a new Mutant-ruled world. In ways, this is a story we've seen before with Magneto as the main antagonist with his idea of a better world run by Mutants, but the large difference here is the villain, who doesn't want to rule humanity, but extinguish it. In my opinion, Apocalypse is a terrific villain, he's introduced right from the start of the film, and his development through the movie is steady and strong. We have ourselves a great, wicked, powerful villain by the end of the movie, which at the end of the day, helps create a better story.The pacing of the film was solid for the most part, outside of a few scenes where it starts to feel choppy. One place in particular, is when Quicksilver's spectacular scene is put back-to-back with Apocalypse's first encounter with Professor X. After an epic showdown between the two characters, ending in the X Mansion, we quickly cut to an entirely different feel, with an 80's soundtrack and loads of humor. Now individually, both of these scenes are brilliant, but put side by side, Apocalypse and his awesome evil ways seem to feel dumbed down, and the movie falls out of place momentarily. Aside from that large hiccup in pacing, the movie has a good flow to its storytelling, and with that, maintains a track record of great stories being told in the X-Men franchise.The action in the film was great. It was large in scope and scale and for the most part, we get to see every character on display a least for a short time. The action sequences don't bog down the pacing of the film, each action scene is written well enough towards the progression of the plot that you won't be caught wondering what the heck is going on. The action is visually engaging, fairly well choreographed, and primarily keeps your eyes glued to the screen.The X-Men universe is a large one, and with separate time lines now a staple of the franchise, we have two actors for almost every character introduced since the first X-Men film in 2000, older and younger versions. For the most part, this has been a strength of the franchise, with two casts being able to develop the same characters. In Apocalypse, we get to see the introduction of younger versions of some iconic characters, including Cyclops, Jean Grey, Storm, Nightcrawler, Angel and Psylocke. Unfortunately, outside of Nightcrawler, who provides some of the films best laughs, and Cyclops, who is played very well by up-and-comer Tye Sheridan, there is some massively underwhelming development and lack of screen time for the other aforementioned characters. I would have loved to see more time spent of Jean, chiefly given that a redo of the iconic Dark Phoenix Saga is reportedly on the way. Storm, Psylocke and Angel were poorly used and heavily under powered, mainly while enlisted as three of Apocalypse's Four Horsemen that he recruits to help him conquer the Earth. The actual performances by the character's actors are frankly wonderful, but the writing of their characters were not so much.While some of the newer heroes have yet to blossom into their full potential, the likes of series mainstays Professor X (James McAvoy), Magneto (Michael Fassbender), Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence), Beast (Nicholas Hoult) and even fan favorite Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) all return and continue to deliver outstanding performances. Wolverine's cameo in the film just might be the best written scene with Wolvie in 16 years. He's fast, looks the part, and is brutally violent, with more blood spilled in one scene than the rest of the X-Men movies combined, a sneak preview at what's to come in next year's R- rated Wolverine movie. Along with Oscar Issac's spectacular portrayal of Apocalypse, and another wildly entertaining performance by Evan Peters as Quicksilver, the majority of the cast and their characters are done very well and are highly entertaining.X-Men: Apocalypse isn't the best film in this franchise, or arguably not even in the top 3 of films (Days of Future Past, X2 and First Class), but that doesn't mean it's not a great film. Yes, there are some inconsistencies in the pacing of the film, some criminally underused characters and a lack of overall development for those characters and the continuing growth of their arcs, and the X-Men franchise at large. However, those flaws cannot hold the film back from telling an engaging immediate story with plenty of humor, showcasing some exciting, occasionally grand action scenes, or having a huge roster of characters played extremely well by every one of their actors, with special recognition to Oscar Issac, Michael Fassbender, and James McAvoy. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the last scene of the film, which is arguably the best. It pays homage to the Bronze Age of comic books, includes terrific fan service and teases the future of the franchise. Even with consistent pressure from fans to return the X-Men film rights back to Marvel Studios and the MCU, Fox and director Bryan Singer continue to prove the doubters wrong with another great entry into the epic X-Men universe.8/10",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516

One of the earliest filmmakers to give comic-books the respect they deserve on the big screen, his 2000 release ""X-Men"" was one of the pioneering films of the recent surge of superhero movies that have been dominating cinemas for years now. And though the series has gone through the highest of highs and lowest of lows, I am proud to have stuck by it. Now, Singer is back again for his fourth directorial effort in the franchise, ""X-Men: Apocalypse""- a film that continues the story-arc first began in 2011's wonderful ""X-Men: First Class."" And while it may not quite live up to the promise of the best in the series, I personally found ""Apocalypse"" to be a charming and highly entertaining new chapter in the long- running series... even if it suffers a problematic script.When an ancient and deadly mutant called En Sabah Nur (Oscar Isaac) is wakened from a slumber thousands of years after being imprisoned, he seeks to unite ""four horsemen"" to cleanse a world he views as corrupt and wishes to rule as a godly figure. Assembling a team including the tragic but villainous Magneto (Michael Fassbender), En Sabah Nur's actions force the X-Men, lead by Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) to emerge once again to protect the world from this terrifying new threat. And their battle will bring them face to face with various figures from their past that they will need to contend with in order to save humanity.As is the case with the franchise at large, the film is an ensemble piece, and much of its success lies in the wonderful casting and the performances. Returning cast members continue to play their roles to perfection, and it was a nice surprise to see some familiar faces return who haven't been around in some time. McAvoy and Fassbender in particular continue their wonderful turns as our two friend-turned-enemy leads, and a returning Evan Peters once again steals the show as the super-fast Quicksilver. It was also a pleasure having Rose Byrne back as CIA agent Moira McTaggert following a multi-film absence in the series. She gets a lot of really nice scenes with Xavier and it reminds us how important she was to the story. New cast members are a blast, and inject new life into the film. Isaac makes for a wonderful new villain with a great sense of threat. Tye Sheridan and Sophie Turner also put in admirable roles as the new Cyclops and Jean Grey. While they aren't given much time together, they both do a fine job with the material, and you can see the seeds planted for what will eventually bloom into the full fledged relationship we saw in the original film. And I adored Alexandra Shipp as our new Storm. She probably gets the clearest arc out of all the new characters, and it came appreciated as Storm has been generally under-developed in the franchise. Honestly, the only cast member new or returning that I feel didn't do an outstanding job was Jennifer Laurence as Mystique. And I do think its because the writers are now afraid to do anything too challenging with her given her fame. As a result, she just seems a bit flat here.Singer's continued allegiance to the series also helps and is a massive benefit in this entry. His keen sense of scope and composition, along with his nice personal touches help craft the film into a solid continuation with many an awe-inspiring action set-piece and humorous character-gag. He maintains a much-appreciated sense of tonal continuity in his entries of the series, and you get the sense he is carefully trying to craft this entry to be sort-of the be-all, end- all of the entire series. And this thankfully makes up for the biggest issue here, which is the script, written by Simon Kinberg from a story he also co-wrote.The films have to this point been able to (mostly) maintain a very delicate balancing act. This is an inherent problem in any film with such a wide variety of characters and story lines playing out, and this is one of the entries in the saga where this balancing act doesn't quite work. Try as he might, Kinberg just can't juggle the various elements at play, and the film comes off as jumbled and disjointed as a result. Key pieces of character development are hastily tossed aside as soon as they are completed and major character arcs are resolved in occasionally unsatisfactory manner, causing an emotional rift to the audience. There's also the occasional odd scene here and there that feels questionable and illogical in terms of timing and placement, as though even on set, rewrites were being performed in an attempt to try and fix issues with the pacing and structure. While by no means terribly written and sporting a solid foundation, it also feels as though the film went into production before the writing had been nailed to perfection.Still, this issue is something I can overlook, in no small part thanks to the infectious charm of the bulk of the cast and for the wonderfully intense visual direction that Singer so excels at. Questionable writing is not a death sentence... sometimes a film can overcome script- related hazards if the other elements excel beyond these issues, and I think that's the case here. Many have been condemning the film for it's quick pacing and issues with character development, but to me, it wasn't a deal-breaker. Should they film have spent a bit more time in pre-production? Yeah, sure. But is it an inherently bad film because of some issues with the writing? No. Weaker than other films in the series, perhaps. But still enjoyable and entertaining despite its flaws.I give it a very solid 7 out of 10.",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516
60,darkreignn,Mediocre,4/10,29 May 2016,"This movie was a disappointment.I was so excited for this movie. The first trailer gave me chills. I was ready. I was prepared. I was lubricated. And you know what? This movie didn't go down smooth. It was long, rough, overstuffed, and worst of all, boring.You've seen the trailer. You know that Apocalypse wants to destroy the world. Why? Who knows at this point. There's ""false Gods"" and ""idols"" so he'll destroy the Earth ""and from the ashes, build a better one!"" But where's the real motivation? We've seen the ""bad guy wants to destroy the world and make a better one"" millions of times before, and seeing it once again was not exciting in the slightest. And Apocalypse wasn't even menacing either. What were his powers? Giving motivational speeches? Seriously, all Apocalypse does is talk and talk and say the exact same things over and over. However, he did have one AWESOME line that had to do with the Tower of Babel, but other than that nothing about his character was memorable or menacing.And what about the four horsemen? They hardly did a thing. Storm? Did nothing. Angel? Nothing. Psylocke? Nothing. They were recruited, and then dropped until the climatic battle scene at the end of the film. They weren't intimidating at all. Now, the film did a good job of setting them up (except for Psylocke in my opinion, she literally had almost nothing to do at all) but once they were recruited, I don't think they said a word ever again. They just stood there, fought a bit, and that was that.Now let's talk about Jennifer Lawrence. Please, for the love of God, get another actress. It looked like she wasn't even trying in the role. She looked so incredibly bored, so incredibly dull, that it looks like she was reading her lines directly off of the script. Everyone else at least looked like they were trying, and then Ms. Lawrence comes on screen and all enthusiasm is immediately gone. And I don't hate Jennifer Lawrence. I liked her in First Class a lot, but now it just looks like she doesn't even want to be in these movies anymore.There were some good things in this film. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender were absolutely fantastic in every scene they were in. Fassbender especially had a fantastic scene in the woods, and he was about to have a fantastic scene in his place of employment (you'll know it when you see it) that was instead ruined by Apocalypse intruding and ruining the momentum. I do want to say though, that the amount of tragedy that Magneto is now suffering in this series is ridiculous. They need to stop making this character suffer over and over just for the sake of him becoming a villain; at this point it's ludicrous. McAvoy is of course great (I haven't seen him play a bad role yet) and I really hope he continues to play this role well into the future.Quicksilver returns, and his scene was just as thrilling as it was in DoFP, if a bit longer and a tad drawn out. I liked Sophie Turner as Jean Grey a lot, even if her accent was a bit spotty at times. She really did seem to be bringing her all to the role, and I look forward to watching her in future installments. I also liked how gruesome this movie was for a PG-13 film. There were some bloody, gory parts in here that literally had my jaw hit the floor, as I didn't expect to see some of the things I saw in a PG-13 superhero movie. Also, there is a sequence, that I will not spoil, that includes some very violent and very raw action, that unfortunately takes place in a section of the movie that honestly could've been cut out. The sequence, however, is great. Overall, this movie was a big disappointment, and I'm sorry to say that. I honestly thought the movie was going to be great, as I absolutely adored the first trailer, but unfortunately it is not. You can't relate or understand where the villains are coming from (except for Magneto), so it's hard for the audience to be invested in them or to care about the stakes. The amount of destruction in this film is almost pornographic, yet there is no impact as all of the carnage is seen from a distance, and not from street level, so the audience feels disconnected to everything that is happening on screen, and in a film that desperately wants its audience to fear its villains and root for its heroes, this is unforgivable, as instead being of thrilled and invested, the audience is bored and detached.",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516
61,devesh070,Action is great  feel of repetition,7/10,16 June 2016,"Actually I watched every parts of this movie and this movie I watched in 3d in cinema that's why action in this movie look so good but when they started show all those character than the feeling of x-men 1 came same character they are showing just actor they changed except wolverine I think everyone is changed, they showed Xavier school where every mutant establishing their ability just as in first three x-men but there is only one thing they came up with new is villain. So, movie starts with the old time around 3000b.c. when one mutant trying to become immortal for that they having ceremony in between that humans interrupted the ceremony and every mutant got killed except this than he gone for long sleep. When he woke up after long sleep he started to control as many mutants as possible. So, some of mutants started working under him some are not. Forcefully he trying to kill or control every human that is why some of the mutant are against him. So, they fight and saved the entire human by that villain. After watching this movie I think there is little bit of repetition in this movie and upcoming parts of this movies series may have lots of repetition let's see how they come up with new idea. Although this movie story is so-so but the action is great as always if you are true fan of this movie series you should watch this movie.",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516
62,ronnet_2,"Not the best, but still a worthy addition to the saga!",8/10,30 July 2016,"Perhaps it's because I've been told how bad this movie is supposed to be by every review I've read beforehand, but this was a great (action) flick! Granted, it's not the most profound of the X-Men film. But then again, what can you expect from a film with a premise about defeating the ultimate evil? As it turns out, quite a lot actually. It's a bit more than a straight up battle royal. I won't spoil anything here but there are some scenes and lines that really do forward the plot lines of individual characters as well as the overall universe. It's not much but it is presented in such a nice package that it satisfied me (and I definitely don't like dumb action films).Having said that, the action in this film is superb. It might be that this does overshadow the plot and character development to some extent but I can't fault a film for having amazing battle scenes. I have rarely been blown away by action scenes in an X-men film. But this film definitely upped the bar. And not just by Quicksilver's amazing scene (which blows the previous out of the water).I feel this film has gotten an undeserved bad reputation. For instance, I recall critics discussing why Apocalypse was underwhelming, in both dialogue and stature. They said it was strange that he could grow tall (as seen in the trailer) but then didn't do this all the time. That is unfair criticism as there is a great explanation for why that occurred only in that particular instance.The above is just an example but overall I feel the criticism was undeserved. And it may well be that this is to be the final X-men film. If that is the case then this is the perfect ending. This film's plot development does bring the X-men saga full circle. I'm a sucker for a good origin story and this film tells the origin of all parts of the title: both Apocalypse and The X-Men themselves.",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516
63,sterlingfu,Worst movie out of the trilogy!!!!!!BORING!!!!,1/10,27 May 2016,"Movie was so boring I wanted to walk out of the movie cinema. Usual lets bring bad guy back, find some other bad guys, destroy the world with mind numbing blah. No twists. No nothing. Predictable trash. The first hour was the concept of ""Hi"" ""Hello"" and we are bringing the band back together.Jean Grey(Stark) was miscast. Why was she in this movie? The acting was poor. And of course Ms. Jennifer Lawrence giving me a Hunger games weak speech at the end. Jennifer Lawrence is not even that talented of an actress but Hollywood is trying so hard with her. She hardly does anything in this movie and just says, ""fight"" over and over. Raven didn't even do anything.""Magneto, you're not bad, you're good"" from Prof. X. I'm thinking, ""Yes, I have the point"". I wish Magneto woulda zapped a coin threw my head at this point. The final scene had him floating for a half hour wondering if he should fight. WTF He did nothing. Or and the fantastic four combine their powers to defeat this stargate joke. I do not recommend. Anyone that said they liked it doesn't know anything about quality. I did like the other two xmen before this. Mostly, ""Days of future Past"". This is as disappointing as ""Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull"". If you do decide to see this movie, I already feel sorry for you. Just give me your 10$ and I just saved almost 3 hours of your life. It was bad...",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516
64,maksim_nikiforovski,"Entertaining, but inconsistent sequel in the X-Men series...",7/10,8 June 2016,"The first X-Men trilogy was weirdly obsessed with Wolverine, and by extension Rouge. I never understood why... This new trilogy is obsessed with Mystique just because America's sweetheart Jennifer Lawrence is portraying her. I don't mind it, but Mystique is no hero, she is a devious villain! And Beast should be well a Beast, but a handsome Nicholas Hoult is better to look at I presume. Storm is not a villain, she is a beloved X-Men character that has never been done justice. These are things that enrage fans over and over again.It is not about being a purist, but about honoring the original. In an age where superheros are invading our cinemas, one could do worse if one watches a film about hope and freedom, about homophobia, racism, bigotry, immigration and all sort of other social issues. And somehow none of the X-men films so far have successfully brought these themes to the screen.This film suffers from having to focus on thousands of characters and locations. Some characters like Mystique and Magneto are given substantial screen time, while others such as Psylocke are given only a few scenes. The film also tries to fit into the overall X-Men continuity, while trying to stand up on its own.A great film for a pop-corn viewing with your friends, but a sub-par X-Men film in general... It is sad that the most substantial superheroes of our age, that really have something to say about the world we live in, are treated as badly as this...Mutant and proud? Unfortunately there is nothing to be proud of except the money the film is about to make.",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516
65,isaiahwilson15,"While it falls under the shadow of DOFP, X-Men Apocalypse is another great entry in the superb X-Men series",8/10,31 May 2016,"With the great amount of superhero movies released today, it is difficult for many directors to deliver a high quality of movies of the course of a series. With X-Men Apocalypse, Bryan Singer may have just proved himself to be the best superhero movie director. Singer once again crafts an interesting story, balances a large cast of interesting character, and shows his ability to direct elaborate action sequences. Although the overall execution is not perfect, it still results in another entertaining superhero film. As with any superhero film, a hero (or in this case heroes) are only as good as its villain, and Apocalypse emerges as a well-done villain, which is a welcoming sight compared to some other recent superhero villains. The opening sequence provides a great backstory to the character, and perfectly establishes him a false god who can't possibly exist without the presence or physical bodies of other mutants. By the time he awakens in 1983 and begins to enact his plan of eliminating the weak, it all makes sense and has actual purpose. His role as an alien of sorts who doesn't understand today's world perfectly lends itself to his plan. It gives the character a commanding purpose, and as a result makes him feel like the all-powerful character Apocalypse is meant to be. Where X-Men Apocalypse especially shines is in its decision to go with another new cast of X-Men. Each actor does a nice job capturing the spirit of their young, inexperienced mutant. Tye Sheridan especially impressed me as Cyclops, showing the mutants growth throughout the movie from fearing his powers to becoming a member of the new X-Men. The addition of fan-favorites like Nightcrawler and Quicksilver were also pretty awesome as the two prove to be the movies biggest scene stealers. Talking about great scenes, I have to mention THAT scene. Yes, X-Men Apocalypse boasts another AMAZINGLY AWESOME Quicksilver scene that somehow transcends the previous one!!!! Combine that with the equally excellent Weapon X cameo, and you'll be sure to walk out the theater with mind blown! For all the flashy scenes that X-Men Apocalypse may boasts, it is littered with flaws. To start, coming into this movie, the X-Men storyline had already been riddled with a number of holes, and this movie only compounds the problem. Even the most dedicated fanboys will have trouble trying to piece together the events from X-Men (2000) to Apocalypse. Also, while the addition of a number of new characters did help to expand the scale of the plot, the movie definitely reaches a maximum occupancy level, which results in a number of characters serving absolutely no purpose. While X-Men Apocalypse's flaws do prevent it from being the best in the X-Men series, it in no way keeps it from being another superb superhero movie. Singer has created a fantastic formula for superhero movies that has shown itself time-and-time again with great results. His ability to create compelling characters, action sequences, and (most importantly) stories has made him one of the best superhero movie directors. X-Men Apocalypse is just another example of the greatness that results from Singer's formula.",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516
66,baqken,X:Men Apocalypse---THE MADE FOR TV MOVIE,1/10,27 May 2016,"I loved the Apocalypse storyline of the 90s animated series so I was pretty stoked about the idea of a movie centering around the Apocalypse character, it's a shame I have to live with it now.The new cast can't seem to hold up a movie on their own, McAvoy is a huge miscast 3 movies later, Fassbender struggles to hold up the movie. It seems like their veteran counterparts did most of the work these past couple of films.Apocalypse is terrible, I had reservations about him before, but you can tell they didn't know where to go with him or how to handle him so they kinda just piggybacked off of stargate. There's this strange pedo-like relationship he has with his younger horsemen. The wolverine cameo was so forced and out of place you'd think this were a superhero spoof movie.There's a random scene where the new gang of mutants goes to the movies and jean literally says ""At least we can agree on one thing: the third movie is always the worst"" and it cuts back to the movie. The scene literally has nothing to do with the rest of the story its just spliced in there for some reason.Which begs me to question whether the cast knew how terrible it was and just did not care.",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516

The fact that it's this good blows my mind, it's the sixth entry in the main X-Men series, and it might be the third best after X2 and Days of Future Past. Oscar Isaac gives an outstanding performance as the mutant menace: Apocalypse, he was the highlight of the film right next to Fassbender's Magneto (who never fails to deliver). In a year with pathetic and disappointing superhero film villains so far, Apocalypse gives us the layered and threatening performance we want from our villains. Evan Peters returns as Quicksilver once more to give us an amazing scene that tops the one from Days of Future Past. The newcomers are fantastic and exciting and we will certainly see them again in the future. They also finally got Cyclops right! Forget about Rotten Tomatoes and go see this film opening weekend, you won't regret!

The X-Men franchise is my favorite out of Marvel. But lately, including with X-Men: Apocalypse, the time lines of all of the movies are being severely screwed up. The more movies they come out with, the more it seems to happen. For example (spoiler**) Storm originally meets Nightcrawler in X-Men 2, but all of a sudden meets him for the first time in this movie now!? Huh!?

71,prospectus_capricornium,"Overstuffed with So Many Things, Tolerable At Best.",5/10,18 May 2016,"There is a searing sense of humanity in X-MEN: APOCALYPSE's effort to thrust Magneto (Michael Fassbender), one of its key characters, into its emotional core. This allows a brief, but commanding moment establish a formidable ground to a film that aspires for enormous accomplishments. Yet these very same ambitions also seem to serve as malignant flaws that inevitably drags this Bryan Singer's desirous experiment into its very own apocalypse. While it stands with its impressive visual execution and incredible size— boasting one of the biggest character ensembles in superhero cinema—'Apocalypse' can only carry out ephemeral glories that can never compensate for the film's utter lack of structure. Ambition turns out to be this film's biggest threat.As compelling as descriptions might have made him appear, titular 'Apocalypse' (Oscar Isaac), doesn't seem capable to inspire the terror he seems to claim. For a villainous figure whose omnipotent power is meant to decimate civilizations, his efforts are mostly spent for futile chases that mostly involve expanding his network of mutants. At some point, the film shifts entirely on laying grounds for an apocalyptic battle that the narrative doesn't seem bothered to get to at a tolerable pace. Along the way, it constructs further story lines which it willingly abandons before any palpable resolution arrives. The film struggles to hold all its weight and extensions together, and yet it keeps introducing elements for which it has no evident plans to efficiently utilize. Much of this film turns out only trying to expand size, but at the expense of having a decent structure. Interesting characters get left underdeveloped, their backstories often written without congruence to the central storyline. And as it may insist, Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) and Professor X (James McAvoy)'s struggle runs on an emotional spine that mainly involves a campaign to retrieve Fassbender's Magneto from Apocalypse's hold. All these actors come out more powerful than their roles dictate them to be, defying the limits of their extremely poorly-written characters with strong performances that are enough to cover up for their characters' lack of development. A short but incredibly singular performance by Fassbender during the film's early minutes may be the spot where the film's sense of humanity is at its peak. Unfortunately, this distinction is relegated below technical pursuits. The ones with smaller roles are seemingly just too small to be served with affecting storyline, an apparent flaw in which Sophie Turner's Jean Grey fell.For all its narrative faults, a hope for some compensations may not at all strike as a bad idea. Singer, here, tries to build an immersive world where action sequences are filled with whizzing lethal beams and energy collisions. The one he creates inspire awe and paves way for breathtaking moments, but this is already as far it can get. 'Apocalypse', in spite of its elaborate designs, doesn't quite get past its mammoth aspirations. It has a lot of stuff going on but the film itself deprives them with space to breathe, and eventually seamlessly integrate with each other in the cosmic expanse that Singer ambitiously tries to construct. So, technical splendor and terrific action setpieces, aside, the only thing that actually makes this film commendable, is the sizable amount of reverence it has paid to the canon, making this Bryan Singer's biggest fan service to date. This movie is tolerable at best.",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516

The thing is not new to the world of comics, but it is still fresh enough for cinema. Although not the first. A few years before that, the Star Trek franchise took up rewriting the canon with the 2009 film. It turned out well. It turned out strongly at the ""Foxes"", which produced a franchise about the X-Men. And now, after a strong blockbuster of 2014, the studio takes a new height for itself with an updated Universe of its heroes, where it presents one of the most powerful villains with the unforgettable name Apocalypse.Bryan Singer, whose ""pen"" belongs to the first two original films about mutants and those ""Days of the Past Future"", sat down in the director's chair again. Corporate identity and excessive pathos have been capturing the viewer since the release of the trailer. The film itself does not lag behind and promises to become a landmark event in the Mutant Universe. Singer is easily recognized. The picture is saturated with bright colors and large-scale scenes, the project focuses on global events and excessive comics, which will definitely appeal to fans of the director's work. On the one hand, it is beautiful, large-scale and bright. On the other hand, this approach clearly pushes the characters and their development into the background. It does not remove it at all (which is only the story of Magneto in this film), but clearly shifts the emphasis towards blockbuster, not drama. And in this pursuit, the attempt to make the project dramatic also causes me, as a spectator, a noticeable dissonance. There is some kind of roll in the project, movement along the sine wave. The film takes turns going through drama, action, comedy, does it in leaps and bounds, which complicates switching from one rhythm to another. Fans, I think, will be satisfied with many of the decisions in the film, and the viewer who is not fond of reading comics can count all of the above as cons.The cast is large. The new project will once again give a new meeting to the audience with their favorite characters and introduce a lot of new ones. There are heroes of the first magnitude here, whose arches will be shown to us. Among them, of course, Charles Xavier and Eric Lansher, doomed to friendship and confrontation among themselves. They are also Professors X and Magneto, played by already beloved actors James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender. Minor characters will not stay away either. Although it is difficult to call them such with each subsequent part of the franchise. The role of most heroes is important and significant for the general universe. I would like to mention the game of Jennifer Lawrence, Nicholas Holt, Rose Byrne, Sophie Turner, Evan Peters.The villain of the picture was the Apocalypse, played by Oscar Isaac. The character is colorful. He had to be opposed to the heroes in such a way that it became immediately clear that this was a universal evil, a rival that would be incredibly difficult to resist. His four horsemen were also supposed to become something odious and deadly. It turned out to be average. On the one hand, the villains are dangerous and large-scale, on the other, they lack charisma, and their actions are complete. And of course, the eternal problem of the hero Fassbender will be touched upon again in this picture (as in the previous ones). Magneto is always standing between good and evil, fighting with himself and his demons, finding himself, but every new film takes up the old one again - digs into his memories and tries to be a villain again. For the third time, such a plot already causes distrust. Everything is the same, only placed in new conditions.The first third or even half of the film is intriguing and sometimes fascinating. The viewer is introduced to heroes and villains, a line of confrontation is built and even there is something similar to intrigue. But by the end, the struggle of some with others even, I remember, seemed to be some kind of protracted, well, moving in a straight line without any surprises and interesting things. That's Singer's world. But it's not bad. Rather, it is just expected.""Apocalypse"" certainly turned out to be a large-scale film. This is a beautiful movie with a lot of action and pathos. Probably, this is a distinctive feature of the paintings of this director. The film is not without problems, but for those who want to see a beautiful blockbuster, it will definitely become an interesting project.7 out of 10.",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516
75,stevendbeard,Good Story/Great Action,8/10,27 May 2016,"I saw ""X-Men:Apocalypse"", starring James McAvoy-Victor Frankenstein- Atonement; Michael Fassbender-Steve Jobs, Haywire; Jennifer Lawrence-The Hunger Games movies, Garden Party and Oscar Isaac-Star Wars:Episode 7_The Force awakens, All About the Benjamins.I think this is about the 6th X-Men movie and the 3rd directed by Bryan Singer, who also directed Days of Future Past, X-men 2 and X-men. James returns as Professor Xavier, as well as Michael as Magneto and Jennifer as Mystique. Oscar is the bad-ass villain and I do mean bad-ass, as he plays En Sabah Nur, aka Apocalypse. Oscar is purported to be the original mutant, from back in the ancient times of Egypt, where he would feed off of other mutants and even absorb their powers which would make him even stronger. After an incident with some non-believers, Oscar is buried in a pyramid for thousands of years, until he is unearthed in 1983. And he does not like what he sees. He decides to just destroy the whole world and start all over, with a little help from his 4 horsemen- kind of like mutant henchmen-paving the way. Since this is 1983 you get to see some of the mutants discover their abilities from the beginning, such as Storm, Cyclops and Nightcrawler. And of course Stan Lee makes his usual cameo; but this time, he has his real life wife standing beside him. There is another X-Men cameo but I'd rather not spoil it for you-you may have already heard about it but it's better as a surprise. There is also a scene after the end credits which has something to do with the aforementioned guest cameo above, so don't leave too soon. Bryan has said that this is the finale of his X-Men story arc but don't worry, there is already talk of more X-men-and X-Force-movies coming. It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence, destruction and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 24 minutes. I really liked it and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516
76,aimthebushes,Cameo appearance of the century!,8/10,2 June 2016,"This was a truly great film, that has to be said. I was never massively captured by X-Men films in the past but since I watched Days of Future Past I was immediately captivated. I went back and watched all the original films and am now a true fan of the franchise. This film had everything as it takes you back through the origins of the cast of the first X-Men film. Perhaps the best origin story of them all, and there were a lot to follow believe me, is that of The Wolverine. Now when he was first shown in the trailer I was hesitant as to his role but as it turns out it was the best role they could have given him.*This where there will be some spoilers*. Wolverine makes his appearance when a group of the mutants are captured by Colonel Striker. Jean Grey, Cyclops and Nightcrawler are roaming around the base when they come across a highly guarded crate which seemed to have some sort of animal in it. It was Jean Grey who identified that it wasn't an animal in the crate, she then continued to open the crate just in time for a group of guards to arrive, before being torn to shreds by a rather angry and distressed Hugh Jackman. During his 5 minute screen time we get to see the aftermath of him being tested on. This isn't linked to the abomination that was 'X-Men: Origins' but a link to his over solo film 'The Wolverine'. Then right at the end we see Jean Grey tap into his memories and give him some back so that he calms down and is able to be that extra 1% happier. The last we see of him is as he goes running off into the cold snowy mountains, a familiar setting to where we see him in 'The Wolverine'. It was a truly fantastic cameo appearance and really acts as a great prequel.I wasn't surprised that this film was great but there were some real stand out performances, McAvoy and Lawrence are no surprise but I was very happy with how Oscar Isaac portrayed the character of Apocalypse incredibly well. We were also able to see the wrath of Havok only shortly before... Well lets not spoil the entire movie. Unless you've read the comic books go and see what happened.Honestly can say this was a great film and was plenty to watch, loads of action and some great story telling. The visual effects were phenomenal although the only downside would perhaps be Psylocke's outfit, wouldn't say it matches her comic book outfit that well but you can easily get over it.Enjoy the film and I hope you agree on the Wolverine cameo scene.",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516
77,sandiegocat,A Great Action Movie from Start to Finish!,9/10,7 June 2016,"If you enjoy well written, well acted, well directed fun summer action movies, go see XMen Apocalypse. Everything is spot on in this movie from beginning to end. The plot is well conceived and carried out, which is sometimes a problem with action/superhero movies (see Batman v Superman as an example of that.) The Big Baddie in the movie is intriguing, powerful, and scary. He feels real and is well acted by Oscar Isaac of Star Wars: The Force Awakens fame.All of the Xmen we love are back. We get to see origin stories for some we've known for a long time. All of the young actors, led by Jennifer Lawrence reprising her role as Mystique, are excellent. We get to see more of the delightful Quicksilver who was introduced and had one of the best scenes in XMen: Days of Future Past as well as a young Storm and a young Nightcrawler doing their thing. The action scenes with Quicksilver running here and there and Nightcrawler popping in and out of fights are some of the best you will see. Watching the conflicts of Magneto, Storm and the others trying to decide which parts of themselves they will embrace and which side of the fight to stand on brings layers to the movie beyond just the action.This stands with the best of the XMen movies and with the best of superhero movies. Don't miss it.",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516
78,Gabs789,"It's cool, well-made effects, nice scenes",8/10,19 June 2016,"Probably what I appreciate most is the great effects. Yeah, movies about superheroes are always known for a lot of effects, but they're not always this good. As far as I've noticed, in most movies the special effects have a lot of flaws. I watched this movie on 4DX and it was pretty good, I appreciated how good it looked visually. I liked the scenes from the different parts of the world, I'd say they're well-planned. When it comes to the plot, I like it that Ancient Egypt is involved, I find ancient civilizations intriguing. Other than that, in many ways it's a typical American movie about superpowers and world apocalypse.

79,jogendra-42350,"With positive viewpoint,It's good",8/10,22 August 2016,"Rather than going after the negative comments of some people,i would like to write my own review.Before 3 months, I watched the movie, I had read all the reviews coming about it. Mostly negatives. And, as the release date approach I kinda had doubts about this last installment. But I went ahead, because I love the casts and Bryan Singer. To my surprise, after I had watched it, my mind were still in awe from the movies. It's not as bad as the critics said. Sure, I am agree with those reviews regarding Apocalypse. But it is so forgivable because the X-men do a heck of a job getting rid of him. As for the fact that there are a lots of characters in there that made them seem a bit underdeveloped because lack of backgrounds,well you gotta admit that this is a 144 minutes movie, which could barely explains all those stories. I left the movie Theatre feeling heartbroken by some of the things that happened in the movie. Hats off to Sophie Turner. She did a great job! Well if you love X-men franchise, you'll love this one.So guys!Watch once with positive viewpoint.Definitely ,you will find some nice things.",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516
80,nik-kirilov,Great movie...but not according your girlfriend,8/10,6 June 2016,"No spoilers.For a good or a bad - it is the (more or less) the typical X-men/Superhero/Super power movie. I'm not some sort of a mega fan or anything but I do enjoy all X-men movies. If not for anything, at least watch 'cause that's the last time that Hugh Jackman will play Wolverine. VERY sad fact for me! The movie has a lot to offer but still nothing that original (more or less). In saying that - it's very colourful and the actors are First class! Im kinda sick of Game Of Thrones actors to be in every new movie in 2016 but I guess it is, what it is. Anyhow, long story - it's a great movie to watch it in the cinema - don't wait to come out on blu-ray or anything like this.

82,reganinglis,More enjoyable than 'Days of Future Past',8/10,15 June 2016,"Only becoming a recent X-Men movies fan, I have to say I really enjoyed 'X-Men Apocalypse'. Definitely up there with 'First Class', but falls short of being better. Apocalypse is a great villain, but doesn't get enough screen time. Quicksilver's scene is nothing short of epic. I never thought they could surpass his scene in DoFP, but somehow they have. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender are also great as Professor X and Magneto. The only major gripe I have is Mystique: I do feel like Jennifer Lawrence at this point is phoning it in, and her disguise gets way too much screen time. She's only really Mystique for like 2 scenes (not even for any full scenes).Overall though I really enjoyed 'X-Men Apocalypse', despite some small issues.",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516
83,gabeelideb,Not as good as First Class and Days of Future Past but still worth your time. Don't listen to the critical reviews!!,7/10,3 June 2016,I've got to be honest. This was the comic book movie I was least looking forward to this year but I went to see it anyway because the trailers made it look decent. I didn't go in expecting much but I was surprised when I really enjoyed this movie. It is no where near as good as First Class and Days of Future Past but it is still worth your time. Apocalypse was a great villain and Oscar Isaacs played him brilliantly. I also didn't mind the costume that much (It could have been better though). Most of the cast was really good in the film (My favourite being Evan Peters as Quicksilver). However unfortunately Jennifer Lawrence was not at her best in this film. She just didn't have the enthusiasm and looked bored for most of the film. I also didn't really like the actress that played Jean Grey. I'm not sure what her name is but to me she was just kind of wooden and boring to watch. I do wish that they could have developed the horseman though (Not counting Magneto) because it seemed like they didn't have much reason to suddenly be bad (Especially Psylocke). The things this film sets up also gets you quite exited for future instalments. I definitely think it is a good thing that they seem to be re-doing The Dark Phoenix Saga and possibly introducing one of my favourite X-Men villains: Mr Sinister. Overall this film is enjoyable and any comic book fan will most likely enjoy it because it is still better than Batman Vs Superman.,X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516
84,Filvies144,"Its not amazing, but the critics were too harsh.",8/10,31 May 2016,"This was actually my first time watching an X-men movie. I never seemed to be interested in the movie series from X-men 2000 to X-men Days of Future past. But like Captain America Civil War, (which is a great super hero movie, a must see) I once again chose to see this over the Angry Birds movie. But that's not the point. I came in with low expectations, expecting it to be only a little better than 2015s non MCU Marvel film Fantastic 4 (which is underrated, but still not good). But I actually found it quite good. Here's why:I found the story in it a rather interesting story that puts you close to the edge of the seat. It includes very funny humor, backstory that doesn't fall at a boring level, and intense , but riveting action scenes. One issue is that the bland characters (which I will get into) gives this interesting story a stale and bland side, but that still doesn't destroy this riveting action movie, Like I said, the characters in the movie are mostly bland, but with little exception. Charles Xavier, for instance is like Nick Fury from MCU films, but he lacks big personality. Raven is also a pretty bland character, and I think the writers /directors could've used the character and Jennifer Lawerence better. But some exceptions are some comic reliefs that are actually funny, and provide most of the great humor the movie has to offer. The villain Apocalypse, lacks a big villain build up, and lacks a personality, but he does have great reasoning for being a villain. In fact, it may b a character a lot of people could possibly root for.So overall, I think that this film is worth your time with Great special effects that look very believable in it's effort, and a great story and humor. It's not as good as Civil War, but it's fun exciting and exciting, trust me.",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516
85,Cizzurp215,Entertaining for sure,6/10,30 May 2016,"Once I released myself from my self proclaimed comic book opinions of how First Class ruined the timeline, I was able to thoroughly enjoy Days of Future Past. Seeing Apocalypse as the next hurdle, I was super excited for this movie. I can say I was not disappointed. I enjoyed the story line and there was tons of action. They managed to avoid the trap of comic books movies of late, re-telling of origin stories and they still managed to introduce new characters and allow for further development of others. I look forward to the future as well. I could nitpick but I would rather allow myself to enjoy as much as possible. Obviously I have questions about some things but hopefully they will be answered in the next few movies.

86,fernandoschiavi,"The change of scenery, new powers of the new characters and a greater magnificence of the work contribute to the film become a great fun.",6/10,4 October 2016,"When director Bryan Singer returned to the franchise X-Men in the previous film ""Days of A Future Past (2014)"", the franchise seemed to gain new life, as it relied on a travel plot in time, the insertion of new characters , loose ends trimmed the script with several references to previous films, and appeared to be a new restart for the franchise, especially after the final scene. And in parts. But what we see here is a direct continuation of the previous film set in 1983, ten years later, exactly, of the events of the previous film.Much of the philosophy and existential questions about prejudice, minorities and acceptance of previous films have been lost and we are faced with an excess of visual effects that impair a better development of various mutant heroes. The long opening is great. Revelation (Oscar Isaac) is revealed with Egyptian pomp to situate the religious part of the plot in a time when the mutation was seen as divine superiority, not genetics. Subtly, the origin of Revelation and subsequent biblical interpretations to make an interesting parallel in certain lines of character, but could be much better exploited. The impression one gets is that it lacked the courage to enter this subject.Already in the 1980s, the best development fell on the oldest characters of the franchise. Ten years after the days events of A Future Forgotten, Professor Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) with the help of Beast (Nicholas Hoult) is now with his School for Gifted Youngsters in full operation in Westchester, New York, home to many students and teaching them to control their powers and develop their skills. Among these students are Alex Summers, the Havok (Lucas Till of ""Wolves""), Scott Summers / Cyclops (Tye Sheridan, of ""How to Survive a Zombie Attack"") and Jean Grey (the beautiful and talented Sophie Turner, the series ""Game of Thrones""). In East Berlin, however, the mutants are not as well treated. There is even a cockfight mutants. Ali, the mutant known as Angel (rookie Well Hardy) dominates the cockfight. To confront him, Night (Kodi Smit- McPhee, of ""Planet of the Apes: The Last Stand""). The latter ends up being found - and saved - by Raven, the Mistica (Jennifer Lawrence in ""The Hunger Games""). Mystique, incidentally, is now regarded as a hero in the young mutants are mirrored.Magneto (Michael Fassbender), after what happened in Washington, lives a new life, away from everything and everyone, right up to a new identity in Poland. He even has a wife and daughter. The CIA agent Moira MacTaggert (Rose Byrne), is following members of an Egyptian sect who still believe in the existence of an ancient God, En Sabah Nur (Oscar Isaac). As for the villain Apocalypse turns out to be a mistake. After a beautiful introduction to the character, he relives in full-year 1980 under any pretext unconvincing. After that, the character has no depth and only dissatisfaction with the current world, decides decimating humans and mutants to start everything from scratch. Pass the impression that the villain was created only to justify the origin of the X-Men. Another important aspect is the look of the first mutant, not resembling absolutely nothing to the character of comics, minimizing its grandiosity and very real threat level. The script around to focus on the relationship Professor Xavier / Magneto and also explore the beginning of the relationship of the young Cyclops and Jean Grey, still trying to control their powers, being helped by Professor Xavier. Other characters appear again as the sprinter Mercury (Evan Peters). He saves all students of professor Xavier mansion that was exploded seconds later, the sound of ""Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)"" by Eurythmics duo. The technical part is really a show piece. With more action than the other films in the franchise, the visual effects work in favor of history and can give huge epic dimension not only of the final battle as the opening scene in Egypt, the fight scenes that take place inside the ship commanded by General William Stryker, the rescue scene of school students of professor Xavier by Mercury, the Magneto power control scene with metals, all the decisive battle of the final half hour of the film. Another highlight again for composers Michael Louis Hill and John Ottman, who also had already set to sound the previous film, and Newton Thomas Sigel on the photo and impeccable production designer Grant Major.Bryan Singer again surprised to be able to put order in a cast so numerous and talented, giving a chance to everyone to have their moment, but suffers in super value the share at the expense of a more consistent and deep history in many ways and especially in construction caricatured (both in interpretation and visual) of the great villain of the adventure, failing to represent a really powerful threat. This is allied to the fact the film have become entertained during his half. The fact that the great villain take the entire first half of the film to appear contribute to this. It is proved here the theory that less is more. At least the change of scenery, new powers of the new characters and a greater magnificence of the work contribute to the film become a great fun.",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516
87,The-Sarkologist,How Professor X Lost his hair,8/10,21 May 2016,"This was actually a lot better than I expected it to be. Okay, it is an X-men movie so I was going to see it within days of it hitting the cinemas, but a part of me was expecting it to be a little washed up and a little dull, especially since this is movie number 10. Well, as it turned out it wasn't – it was really enjoyable. Mind you, don't expect it to closely follow the timeline as set out in the previous movies namely because, as we all know from Days of Future Past, the time line has been changed. This means that Scott Summers is introduced to the X-men in a different way (as opposed to how he was introduced back in X-Men Origins:Wolverine).As you are probably aware, Wolverine doesn't really make an appearance in this film (well there is an uncredited cameo, but that is about it). This is not surprising since Hugh Jackman is on the verge of hanging up his adamatine talons (he is getting pretty old). However, rumour has it that this is probably going to be the second-to-last X-men movie in the franchise, and I suspect that we won't be seeing McKellan or Stewart reprising their roles in the future either (most likely, if another X-men movie does appear, it will be Fassbender and McIvoy).In a way this is another of the origin movies, though here we see a rebooted version of the Scott Summers origin story, and the Storm origin story (as well as having Jean Grey and Nightcrawer taking lead roles as well, which is somewhat different from when Nightcrawler made an appearance in X2). What the movie does is that it sets the scene of what will become the X-men, though I have a feeling that the Brotherhood of Mutants may be something that has now been left in the alternate timeline (you will see why when we get to the end of the film).What we have is the first mutant – Apocalypse – waking up from a five thousand year slumber after a conspiracy resulted in him being buried deep in the Earth. Apocalypse has the habit of transferring his consciousness to other mutants, thus gaining their powers, and in turn becoming stronger himself. However he can also imbue others with his powers, thus strengthening them – he is always known to travel with four lieutenants, who are known as The Horsemen. Thus when he awakens his first job to to find four mutants to be his henchmen.We also find Magneto has withdrawn from society to live in a small cottage in Poland and is working in a steal mill. I should mention that the film is set in the late eighties, thus continuing the Origins theme, which has set all of the X-men movies in the past (which was designed as a way of rebooting the franchise after a rather disastrous X-men III movie). However, the two movies that are referred to here are First-Class and Days of Future Past (though we do note that Steward and McKellan did revise their roles in the last movie).All in all this was a pretty enjoyable movie, and the character of Apocalypse was actually really well done. I also quite liked Magneto, who is still struggling with his identity and his place in the world. He doesn't necessarily come across as the stereo-typical villain, but rather a man with internal struggles, and one who was suffered pain because of who he is, and then lashing out in anger at a world that does not seem to care. As we know, the X-men franchise has always been one about power, and power struggles, and how to respond against persecution because of who one happens to be. This theme comes through into this film as well, as well as bringing along many of the other characters, such as William Stryker and Moira McTaggart, who have been staples in some of the other films.",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516
88,MrDHWong,"A solid entry into the series, but not on par with its two excellent predecessors",8/10,19 May 2016,"X-Men: Apocalypse is the latest installment in the X-Men franchise and the third film in the rebooted series. While not on par with its two excellent predecessors, I still found it to be a solid entry into the series. However, I recommend seeing the original two films first.In 1983, the mutant Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac) awakens from a millennial-long sleep and vows to destroy mankind and take over the world. With the help of his Four Horsemen; Psylocke (Olivia Munn), Storm (Alexandra Shipp), Archangel (Ben Hardy) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender), Apocalypse plans to create a world for mutants only. It is up to the X-Men, lead by Professor Charles Xavier (James McAvoy), to work together and prevent Apocalypse and his team from succeeding.Filled with all of the explosive action and comic relief one would expect from the franchise, X-Men: Apocalypse unfortunately falls a bit short of being equally as good as the two great films that preceded it. The story would be hard to follow unless one has seen the previous films. With that said, I still really enjoyed the film for what it was. I particularly enjoyed the way that it expended on Magneto's story and showed how he just wants to be accepted for who he is, despite his mutant powers. I also really liked Sophie Turner (Sansa Stark from Game of Thrones) as the young Jean Grey. However, it is Quicksilver (Evan Peters) who steals the show in some of the funniest comic relief I have ever seen in a Marvel film. I can only recommend this film to those who have seen all of the previous X-Men Movies, if you haven't then I say watch them first.I rate it 8/10.",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516
89,trooper5783,Just as good as Days Of Future Past- can't wait to see what happens next,10/10,1 June 2016,"On Saturday, I went with a friend to go see X-Men: Apocalypse because I needed to spend some time out of the house and with my friend I haven't seen in a while. I did see DOFP in the cinema as well and I highly enjoyed that one, although I don't remember much about it other than that fantastic Quiksilver scene and the ending, and I highly enjoyed this one as well! What makes this X-Men interesting is that it revolves around different themes and other items in storytelling than in most superhero films released in this day and age, and for some, it might be easy to confuse or frustrate. But I appreciate this new brand of storytelling in this film, I think what any comic book movie should do is make you think to make it unique in its own way, and this film does that to make it something genuinely special. Oh, by the way- Oscar Isaac NAILED it as Apocalypse, he's so intimidating to the point where I would watch it solely because of him! And although all of the action sequences are so much fun, there are two of them that stole the entire movie for me- if you thought Quiksilver's scene in DOFP was amazing, you ain't seen nothing yet! I'm already seeing this movie again in the theater, and I honestly think it's that level of worthy! Also, I did see this in 3D, and although it doesn't add much to the movie's quality, the added depth does look nice in a lot of certain set-pieces, so if you love 3D, then you'll probably get a kick out of this one, and I thought it looked cool enough, so whether you watch it in 2D or 3D, this movie's a lot of fun all around.",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516
90,markwoo,On a par with x-men first class,7/10,31 May 2016,"I enjoyed this film and would recommend it as one of the better films of late. Anyone who has read my other reviews will see that I am a harsh critic of dull, unintelligent films of which I have seen far too many of late. I loved Apocalypse's ability to boost the power of other mutants and who can also resurrect himself via other mutants whilst at the same time gaining their powers. Unfortunately some of the other powers he demonstrates are laughable; like plastering people into walls. Anyway here you have a well-paced film where mankind gets breather from Apocalypse by interrupting the resurrection process trapping him in limbo. Fast forward to now and lo and behold he gets free again and the stage is set for another good v evil ending, but what x-men story doesn't have this? Nevertheless and despite knowing this, the film builds to a fine climax. It is a shame that the ultimate victory over Apocalypse was so predictable. I would have preferred to see it play out as follows:- Have Apocalypse take Xavier's powers then find that Jean Grey has more but in attempting to get hers inadvertently releases 'Phoenix' who wipes him off the face of the earth, followed by the saving of Professor Xavier by some means (possibly using 'wolverine's' recovery powers. What do you think? Afterthought: It is such a pity that special effects have become so dominant these days because it clearly makes it harder and harder to outdo what has come before and there is little that is refreshingly new here.",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516
91,griffolyon12,A Spoiler-Free Review,9/10,27 May 2016,"The X-Men are back in the sixth movie in the X-Men franchise and the fourth to be directed by Bryan Singer. While this is the end of the second X-Men trilogy, it also feels like a new beginning. The main thing to understand with X-Men: Apocalypse is that you shouldn't listen to most of the critics lambasting it for its vast number of characters and story lines. Even though there is a lot that goes on in X-Men: Apocalypse, it's all emotionally engaging and most importantly, fun.X-Men: Apocalypse takes place ten years after the events of Days of Future Past in 1983. The world's very first mutant from Ancient Egypt, a being named Apocalypse who thinks himself a god, awakens from suspended animation and sees how the world has become without his leadership. Apocalypse sets out to destroy almost the entire Earth to start humanity over anew, with only those pesky X-Men standing in his way. In a nutshell, that's the entire movie, but what gives X- Men: Apocalypse its emotional resonance is the fact that it is the sixth X-Men movie.This is a direct sequel in the way that The Empire Strikes Back was to Star Wars. The movie makers don't waste time reminding us who these characters are or what they're doing, they simply assume we've watched every other X-Men movie. While there might be a few passive fans of the franchise who do not like this approach, as a fan who has seen all of the X-Men movies multiple times, I was on cloud nine practically the entire runtime. On top of that, this one and Days of Future Past feel like the movie makers are finally embracing the more comic bookish nature of the X-Men. There are a lot more fantastical images in this one that look and feel as if they were taken straight from the pages of the comic books, and as a comic book fan, that's just icing on an already delicious cake.Overall, I absolutely loved X-Men: Apocalypse and it's my personal favorite superhero movie of 2016 so far. I know those are fighting words, but all of my favorite X-Men are represented in this movie and shine brighter than these movies have ever let them shine. From the teenage reintroductions to Cyclops, Jean Grey, and Nightcrawler, it's like Bryan Singer was reading my mind Professor X style to deliver the X-Men movie I've wanted for years.I give X-Men: Apocalypse a 9 out of 10!",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516
92,Shameek,Probably the best X-Men movie to date.,8/10,14 September 2016,"X-Men movies over the years have been pretty inconsistent in terms of their quality. You might like one only to find the next is disappointing. But even the ones that were good were still quite rough around the edges. This is where Apocalypse stands out. It doesn't just feel good but also feels like a well polished movie.The movie has a lot of strong points. Story, casting, dialog, music score, graphics, editing and action sequences are all very good. Character background/development in such a jam packed movie is always gonna be a little rushed but its still there, enough for the viewers to be able to sympathize with the characters. That is probably helped by the fact that the movie is quite long, which is a good thing.I wouldn't say X-Men Apocalypse is a classic mainly because it lacks truly epic moments. But it is nonetheless a very good and entertaining movie that may well be the best ever to come out of the franchise.",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516
93,hjrock-03001,X-Men: Apocalypse is great if X-Men: Days of Future Past was awesome,8/10,10 May 2016,"Overall movie was great Although movie starts a bit slow and i was a little confused and bored but after that the movie finally starts catching up to the expectation.For me this was the best x-men movie because this movie has the best action sequences as compared to any other x-men movie with a great story and emotion(not as good as days of future past but who cares its a superhero movie) .and QUICKSILVER WASSS AWESOMEEEEE .I can literally watch the movie again just because of quicksilver.I never thought they could top the X-Men: Days of Future Past action(or comedy) scene but they did.Acting of all the cast members were awesome and James McAvoy,Michael Fassbender & Jennifer Lawrence knocked it out the park.I don't understand the critics , I never did.(sound's similar to superman's mom in BvS that was in the trailer :P)Movie the great and I can't wait to watch it again.",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516

95,shinsrevenge,maybe the best X-Men-movie so far,9/10,3 August 2016,"The 3 first movies were great. So was the first Wolverine movie, Origins. Then began the downslide. First class was okay, the second Wolverine movie was a bit disappointing and ""Days of future past"" a letdown.So I didn't expect much when I started watching this. I was greeted by an awesome opening with great music, playing in ancient Egyptian. Majestic statues of old Egyptian gods, a huge pyramid, a ritual to turn their mutant god into an even stronger god. Wow. And that were only the first minutes.Then some of the Egyptians plot against their godlike leader and his mutant followers to make the pyramid collapse and bury them alive. Their plan works. Except for the part where the followers sacrifice themselves to save their king. He is held is some kind of stasis for a few thousand years, waiting for time to rise again.Once he walks the earth again, the villain soon gathers some strong mutants as new followers around him. The X-Men desperately try to fight him, but they are fighting on two fronts. Stryker and his mad scientists are also after them.Times never have been so hard before for the X-Men. Or everyone else, for that matter. The amount of destruction is even bigger than the one time Jean Grey turned into the ""phoenix"" and went on a rampage. But that doesn't mean that she can't save the day.Which is one of my few points of criticism. Her powers couldn't destroy Logan, but she could take down an ancient, almost almighty mutant who had lived a thousand lives and consumed countless mutants and their abilities (one of them being a significant healing ability).Second point of criticism: The Egyptian villain wants to destroy the world to build a new one. At one stage he gains control over all the nuclear missiles in the world. Now I know what you think: Game over, mankind. But no, that would be too easy. Instead of making them fire the nuclear missiles on each other he just fires every single one of them into space. Because! (Enter reason here, if you find one) Anyway, despite very few flaws this was an epic movie. 9/10",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516
96,kevbee,Even the actors looked bored,1/10,18 May 2016,"If you like to mindlessly waste an hour or two of your precious existence, then possibly this cinematic garbage might be for you. However, if you want your cinema to be entertaining, then stay well away. This movie could (and should) have had at least 30 minutes cut from the running time. The pacing is so slow and not helped by the overuse of set CGI pieces that somehow were not thrilling at all. There was better stuff in The Mummy.This is lazy film making. And the response from the audience I was part of? A considerable amount of audible yawning.One of the worst films I've seen this year. Let's hope the plug is pulled on this franchise. It's overstayed its welcome.

97,adieldevilliers,X-MEN tastic,8/10,28 June 2016,"I really loved this movie. I have always been of the opinion that the acting from Jennifer, Michael and James are superior to the actual material. The story is a little over complicated and being a fan of the previous movies I was a little lost in recalling what happened previously. I probably should have revisited them before watching this one. Throughout the movie I kept on hoping Erik, Mystique and Charles would survive so that we could have more movies with the same cast. I thoroughly enjoyed their interactions, their connections and their backstory. I didn't like the overall story line of Apocalypse and his 4 horsemen/women. We also didn't get to know them very well. The scene where Charles speaks to Erik and Apocalypse is busy doing a project runway costume design was just laughable. The whole Erik using the earths metals to destroy everyone was stupid. Apocalypse could have done that himself, faster and more efficiently. He was more obsessed with getting Charles's power. Why? so he has to switch to a new body, does he then retain his old bodies powers, with the powers he already has can't he just absorb other mutants powers.Why did Charles wipe Moira's memory of them? Charles deserved to be happy. When Beast helped Mystique to move to safety it was so cute, so many feels, we could've done with more of that. And why are they not together? So basically, please make more X-men movies and please recast Wolverine.",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516
98,jackson-regurge,Another X-traordinary film added to the franchise!,7/10,1 June 2016,"I recently watched the latest instalment of the X-Men franchise. I had heard a lot of negative publicity towards the film and to be honest I think that X-Men: Apocalypse is actually a very well made and interesting movie. All of the performances in the film are flawless. However, James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender's performances are very powerful and bring a great deal to the film. The character Apocalypse (portrayed by Oscar Isaac) is also extremely intriguing and nothing like anything we have seen before. The storyline of the film, although following a lot of individual story lines, is very straight forward and easy to follow without being too clichéd. Singer's direction is on the money. However, he has proved himself multiple times already - so much so that I would expect nothing less. Inspiration from the comics has clearly been interwoven into this film as characters such as Psylocke are seen rocking costumes almost identical to those seen in the comics. The CGI and other special effects seen in the movie are also breath taking and it is clear that now the X-Men films have truly perfected their style. It is easy to see that many people have worked very hard to create such spectacular effects. Overall, I would give this film 8 out of 10 because it is everything a good X-Men film should be: interesting, relatable and impressive. The film even has a cameo from a very familiar friend to the franchise and, although this time he is not a front runner, it is okay because even just a taster is fun to see.",X-Men: Apocalypse,3385516
