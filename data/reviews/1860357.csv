0,rgkarim,Dive Deep Into The Horizon Of Flames,8/10,29 September 2016,"What is it about disasters that we enjoy watching? I could come up with a number of reasons, but the bottom line is that Hollywood has shifted to dramatizing former events as a means for more movies. Hi, Robbie K here bringing you another review of the latest films to grace the screen. Tonight we hit Deepwater Horizon starring Mark Wahlberg, Kurt Russell, and a handful of other actors. Let's get started. LIKES:  Great acting  Over the top graphics  Emotionally stimulatingYou might be thinking that I have gone crazy, after all Wahlberg hasn't had the greatest roles. Deepwater Horizon breaks the mediocre streak and drops him into a position that may net him an Oscar nomination. Wahlberg's portrayal of Mike Williams is certainly a heroic one filled with wisdom, strength, and a calm edge that sets the stage for a natural leader. But there is also a realistic side brought out near the second half the screen that balances out the heroic theatrics of Hollywood. Kurt Russell no surprise plays his usual rugged role, making sure to add the hard edge testosterone rush all older actors need to bring. Hudson and Malkovich get A's as well, each bringing the needed involvement to round out the cast. All the extras and lesser billed roles complete the picture as a close oil crew, but much of their time is spent standing around or ducking from fire. Speaking of fire, the visual effects are top notch in terms of computer graphic imaging. Deepwater Horizon's reconstruction of an oil rig succumbing to its doom is very realistic. For you technical folks, the directors have crafted scenes to mimic the daily operations involved with pumping oil, from watching gritty mud flow through the pipe to the cracking foundation floor. That sound boring? Well those looking for a little more suspense will be impressed when the whole operation blows to piecesliterally. You might be amazed seeing the rig, and its crew, get covered in oil before erupting into a fiery inferno you've seen in the trailers. My friend described the visuals being so good, he felt immersed into the disaster, wanting to duck or dive as explosions rattled the screen. Of course the real magic to the visual effects are the emotions it brings with it. The various sequences and montages of the exploding metal certainly paints a terrifying picture as you wonder how much time is left until something falls. Now add our characters trying to traverse the obstacle course from heck, feeling horrifying chills run through your body as you watch human bodies hurled through the air and disturbing injuries protruding in gory details. However, it is not all dismay and dread, no Deepwater Horizon has plenty of sequences and montages of heroism that will make you a little proud to be a humanno matter how overly theatrical it could be. DISLIKES:  Overdramatic at times  Already know the ending  Editing needs workI'm probably sounding overcritical or nonsensical, but here it goes anyway. Deepwater Horizon is at times a bit on the overdramatic side. As I said, much of the movie will light a fire in your soul that will have your patriotism in full force. Unfortunately, some of these moments are a bit too fake and in your face to get my full backing, primarily making an effort to pan on the American flag flapping in the flames. Even the more heroic moments sometimes get a bit too corny, the overdramatic focus on the camera amid a symphony soundtrack blaring pride. Again, they get the message across and deliver the emotion, it just sometimes gets a little too Hollywood for me. The special effects and the noble protagonist will certainly spread suspense and awe, but it doesn't help that you know the ending. If you paid attention to the news, you know all about what happens to the rig, and if you choose to ignore history take a look at the trailer. The opening sequence doesn't help things either by telling you the fate of a certain character that further adds predictability to the mix. What does leave in terms of suspense and surprise? Pretty much it is the fate of the crew that held any mystery to me, and that was scarce at times. Perhaps another minor dislike, but still one nonetheless. In regards to the editing, this one is a tough call to make. On the one hand I appreciate the details they provide about the incident, from the development of the disaster to how they faced the inferno the rig became. And yet, I felt some of it was elaborated too much for my liking. The build up was a little too long and drawn out, making it slightly boring as we waited for the dirt to hit the pipe. As the oil begins to bloom into a fountain the pace picks up, but then hits a very slow, somewhat pointless, standstill at the aftermath of the situation. Yes, it provides realism and rounding out of the characters, but again is a little too extended after all the excitement. They probably could have spared about fifteen minutes, but hey that's just me. THE VERDICT:Despite this being the third historical event to get a movie this month, Deepwater Horizon will provide the emotional thrills you want. A fantastic CGI design that's brimming with emotion and suspense. However, the predictability and overdramatic moments fall in line with Hollywood's magic and takes away from the message of the movie. I have to recommend this one for the theater though, primarily for the technological achievements it brings. Overall my scores are:Action/Drama/Thriller: 8.0 Movie Overall: 7.0",Deepwater Horizon,1860357
1,lnvicta,"Gripping and realistic, Deepwater Horizon works both as an enlightening documentary and a fun blockbuster.",7/10,1 October 2016,"Deepwater Horizon is a movie that succeeds on two levels: as an action-packed blockbuster and as an honest depiction of a tragic disaster. It's the story of the BP oil rig that exploded and contaminated the Gulf of Mexico. The way Berg directs the sequence of events is well paced and purposefully developmental for a good chunk of the movie. It takes about 45 minutes before the crap hits the fan, during which we're allowed time to get to know the characters - their quirks, their personalities - so we can empathize with their situation. The stakes feel real, as they should (and were), which is a testament to the directing and the acting. Mark Wahlberg and Kurt Russell dominate in their roles, Russell given the opportunity to remind us why he's one of the biggest stars ever. The supporting cast is excellent, including John Malkovich, Gina Rodriguez, and Dylan O'Brien, who have chemistry and rapport between other characters (Malkovich and Russell sharing a couple intense moments where not a word is said).The disaster itself is portrayed brilliantly. The tone remains frantic and the stunning special effects work puts it over the edge. Once things go south, it's a nonstop adrenaline rush till the end. The only reason it's not rated higher is because it's merely a depiction of events, nothing groundbreaking or revolutionary in regards to storytelling. But it didn't have to be. This was a tragic event and the gritty realism shown here is as refreshing as it is intense. If you're in the mood for a deeper-than-average thrill-ride, look no further than Deepwater Horizon.",Deepwater Horizon,1860357
2,dave-mcclain,"The strengths of ""Deepwater Horizon"" are its strong characters and its extraordinary attention to detail.",7/10,30 September 2016,"Peter Berg makes movies, but he also knows a lot about deep-water oil exploration. He'd have to, considering how complicated this dangerous activity is, and how well he handled those complexities and portrayed that danger in his film. Berg directed ""Deepwater Horizon"" (PG-13, 1:47), the dramatization of the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil rig explosion which killed 11 people and resulted in the largest oil spill in the history of the petroleum industry and the biggest environmental disaster in U.S. history. A combination of faulty equipment and human error caused the disaster. Methane gas escaping up the rig's pipes enveloped it, ignited and eventually consumed the rig, which burned until sinking into the ocean 36 hours after the initial explosion. The titular rig's owner, Transocean, and its client, BP, traded accusations of wrongdoing for years, while various cases worked their way through the courts – and a lengthy environmental clean-up of the gulf coast proceeded. No one went to jail, but, according to Wikipedia, ""To date BP's cost for the clean-up, environmental and economic damages and penalties has reached $54bn."" But that's all scientific and industrial detail. This film is mainly a story about people.Berg (with his screenwriters, Matthew Michael Carnahan and Michael Sand) personalizes the story by focusing on a few key people involved in the events depicted. Master electrician Mike Williams (played by Mark Wahlberg, who Berg also directed in 2013's ""Lone Survivor"") is a devoted family man with a loving wife (Kate Hudson) and a sweet and precocious daughter (Stella Allen), who's very proud of her dad and his job. Radio operator Andrea Fleytas (Gina Rodriguez) is a young, single woman who has a steady boyfriend and loves her vintage Ford Mustang, even if she does have trouble keeping it running. Both Mike and Andrea work for ""Mr. Jimmy"" (Kurt Russell, appearing on film for the first time with Hudson, who is his adopted daughter) is the caring, but tough and diligent Transocean foreman on Deepwater Horizon, who often finds himself at odds with BP's corporate representatives on the oil rig.As Mr. Jimmy and his crew arrive at the rig for their three-week-long turn on board, it's apparent that the departing shift (including Berg, in a cameo role, in which he briefly talks with Russell's character) hasn't done their due diligence in taking care of operation and safety concerns on the rig. While entertaining two BP executives who are visiting Deepwater Horizon (and who present him with a safety award during a brief ceremony), Mr. Jimmy locks horns with BP liaison Donald Vidrine (John Malkovich). Mr. Jimmy insists on a test of the pressure entering the well from beneath the ocean floor. When the test gives conflicting results and the results of an alternate follow-up test complicates the situation further, the stage is set for disaster. The rest of the film depicts that disaster with astonishing detail and realism as everyone on that rig fights for survival and for the goal of getting back safely to their families.""Deepwater Horizon"" is a fascinating, entertaining and inspiring take on a real-life disaster. We get good character development and a detailed behind-the-scenes look at the considerations, disagreements and actions that led up to the catastrophic explosion, but there are a couple problems with all that. Berg does a good job with a combination of dialog, on-screen verbiage and impressive visuals to help us understand the dynamics at play, but it almost seems like too much, and the conversations, with a lot of technical jargon, characters talking over each other and seeming to mumble their lines, and some with various southern accents and some without, combine to make it difficult to tune one's ear to the dialog and understand everything that's being said. However, the main point of this movie is the survival story. Berg had a realistic version of the rig built (including many working components) for shooting. His attention to detail – in the set and in the film's visual effects is nothing short of remarkable. What's more, we care about the characters and the danger they're in feels real. For excellent acting, a well-developed story and incredible visuals, you should put this film on your horizon. ""B+""",Deepwater Horizon,1860357
3,0w0,"Focuses mainly on the explosion & immediate aftermath, and little on the finer details",7/10,8 May 2020,"It's sad to think that Transocean/BP lost nothing, and 11 people lost their lives (and who knows how many millions of animals died from the 210million gallons of oil that was spilled).Transocean/BP got at least a $500million insurance payout, and who knows how many billions of dollars they made from the Deepwater Horizon rig in the 10years that they operated it. And NOBODY went to prison. 11 people dead and no repercussions.Anyway, the film is pretty good... I would have liked it if they went into a bit of detail on what all the various terms is that they used like marine riser, annular, EDS, kick, and so on. They used to many terms and jargon that the average viewer is left in the dark. They could maybe even have shown what the capping process looks like in the aftermath of the whole event, as I think the capping process would have been very interesting and would have placed a capper (excuse the pun) on the whole movie.But it's a good movie to watch if you're interested in the whole event, even-though it does offer only a cursory glance at the causes of the disaster, and spends the majority of the time focusing on the panic & mayhem that happened during the actual explosion.",Deepwater Horizon,1860357
4,Matin_Shwany,Amazing!,7/10,13 December 2019,"Deep water horizon delivers what it was, the story based on the true events of deepwater horizon oil spill that exploded, well at first 30 mins was just getting into the story and building the characters i was waiting to reach the point when will the things were going to start, after all it got me into its atmosphere and catching up with the scenes, amazing cinematography with all those explosion and fires burning behind the scenes, discovering the life of those workers kinda gets hard to watch how people are dealing with those things, seeing people between life hope and survival, at the ending it was sad to see all those workers had lost their lifes, at last its well crafted, highly recommended if you like disaster types, 7.5/10⭐

5,alaanazrem,Everyone at the Rig SIte have the right to STOP THE JOB,10/10,29 September 2016,"I am an engineer working offshore in North Sea. I have seen the movie this evening in UK. Is really a good movie, congratulations to all involved you done a great job showing a little bit of ''life in offshore rig''. Looks like in this movie is BP fault but in real world at the rig site everyone has the right to STOP THE JOB if something is wrong or something is going on against the procedures. I have work before in BP rigs in North Sea and I stop the job when I wasn't happy with what is going on I had all the support from the Service Company that I am working for and also BP company understood my concerns. If you are a engineer, roughneck, derrick-man or whatever you are at Rig Site if you think that something is going wrong and against the procedures STOP THE JOB. I do it and I will do again better to lose my job than to see people dying.(Thanks for reading my review)

6,brooksrob1,A journey into areas we don't often see...,8/10,12 November 2016,"I read the reviews before I watched it, Generally, an over 7 is usually a decent movie and you won't be disappointed.I like the technology and the Rig speak, which for guys that work with their hands, just sounds right to the ear.These guys did a good job of portraying a Gulf of Mexico type Roughneck...Having spent 6 months in Biloxi, you meet the type...A quiet dignity and hellraisers when they're off...You have to respect the intricacies of the work these men do to keep us moving...I really liked Malkovich's role, he put some meat on that bone; :)...Of course Wahlberg is good in his role too...Nice to see Kurt keeping up too...If you're looking for subtlety and nuance, this is NOT the type of movie you should watch...If you enjoy watching men risk their lives to serve the nation's energy requirements and the sacrifices and sometimes the ultimate sacrifices, all in the name of the job; you'll be glad you saw it... Respect to all whose job can kill you...Stay safe.",Deepwater Horizon,1860357
7,ThomasDrufke,An Emotional Thrill Ride,8/10,30 September 2016,"Deepwater Horizon is the first of two Peter Berg directed films this year, and if Patriots Day is anywhere near as good as this film we could be looking at quite a few nominations for Berg come February.Deepwater Horizon tells the story of the crew members of the rig of the same name in April 2010, when the largest oil spill in U.S. history began. Berg is always a guy to count on with this type of harrowing true story. He has the skills of an action film director while also having the delicate hand for an emotionally powerful touch. And much like the recently released 'Sully', this film is a strong tale about the power of the human spirit.Putting Battleship aside, Berg has always had a knack for directing high intensity sequences of trauma and thrills. Even taking that note into a smaller scale with Friday Night Lights, Berg is great at managing to balance intensity and emotion. Deepwater Horizon is perhaps his biggest scale film thus far, but it's also incredibly personal as well. It stars Mark Wahlberg, Kurt Russell, Gina Rodriguez, and Kate Hudson. All of them get the opportunity to act in small intimate moments as well as physically demanding scenes. Usually, it's those small moments that bring the emotions out of me, and that was Kate Hudson here. I feel like she hasn't gotten a lot to do since her breakout with Almost Famous, but this may be the best she's been since. She plays Wahlberg's wife, and it's simply her reactions to the devastation on the oil rig while she's at home, that really got to me. Powerful stuff.With all that said, sometimes the high octane thrills feel to be heightened just for heightening certain situations. Berg never loses sight of the end goal here, but some 'action'-ish scenes are almost a little too much, considering how contained this story feels. It doesn't take you out of the film, but you will feel like it could have been handled differently.Like Berg's previous film, Lone Survivor, it does a nice job of honoring those who died at the rig and the families severely affected by the tragedy. It's a powerful film with gripping performances from Hudson and the rest of the cast that will likely lead it right into the awards season come winter time.+Berg's delicate touch+Hudson+Devastating-Some heightened moments8.6/10",Deepwater Horizon,1860357
8,claudio_carvalho,Impressive Dramatization of a Tragic Disaster,8/10,27 December 2016,"When the superintendent Jimmy Harrell (Kurt Russell) and the chief of maintenance Mike Williams (Mark Wahlberg) disembark on board of the Transocean semisubmersible offshore drilling rig ""Deepwater Horizon"", they are surprised with the information that the Schlumberger people had not conducted the pressure test in the deep water cement.to confirm the wellbore integrity. The BP representative Donald Vidrine (John Malkovich) had sent them home to save money. Jimmy decides to run tests but Vidrine believes the result is a problem in the sensor and orders to open the well. However the cement does not resist and there is a blowup with tragic consequences. In 2010, the Oil & Gas industry was surprised with the news that a blowout had caused the explosion of the Transocean semisubmersible offshore drilling rig ""Deepwater Horizon"" and killed eleven workers. Two days later, the platform sank, causing the largest oil spill in the US waters. ""Deepwater Horizon"", the 2016 film, is an impressive dramatization of the incident with the drilling rig with many technical details. However the screenplay is very well-written and the plot is accessible to the common viewer. The performances and the special effects are top-notch. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Horizonte Profundo: Desastre no Golfo"" (""Deepwater Horizon: Disaster in the Gulf"")",Deepwater Horizon,1860357
9,audiodave_82,Must be seen in the theatres! (IMAX if possible),9/10,29 September 2016,"I usually don't write reviews but saw mostly negative reviews on here so far and that ain't right.It is not a perfect movie and it's not artsy, or profound. However it is very entertaining, has wide appeal, will make you laugh, have you on the edge of your seat and might even make you cry. It's a slow build at the beginning but the tension soon rises and you will then be hooked. The effects appear to be realistic and mostly practical made with a production value that appears to be one of the most expensive films ever made (which alone is impressive given it is not a sequel or superhero movie).Mark Wahlberg works as an everyman lead, but it is Kurt Russel who steals the show. Maybe the performance of his career, and the strongest aspect of the film in my opinion. Malkovich is also amazing as the villain, stealing every scene he is in. The two of them along with the incredible story done with top notch sets, effects and sound is exactly why you have to pay the money to see this on the biggest screen possible.If you need a film to be a character study or you want senseless action from start to finish then you might be one of the people who is disappointed. But if you are looking for a gripping story with great tension and action that can be enjoyed by a wide range then go see this film.",Deepwater Horizon,1860357
10,bob-the-movie-man,Oils well that ends well,6/10,8 November 2016,"""Full of sound and fury, Signifying nothing"" could be a summary of this modern-age disaster movie. In 2010 the ""Deepwater Horizon"" drilling rig off the coast of Louisiana failed in spectacular fashion, bursting into flames and spewing millions of barrels of crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico in what was the worst oil-spill in American history. Mark Wahlberg plays the well-respected electrical 'Mr fixit' Mike Williams on the rig, reporting to the Operations Manager Jimmy Harrell (Kurt Russell). The exploratory project is way-behind and BP are not happy. Big-wigs from the company add support to Donald Vidrine, the BP site leader, in applying mounting pressure on Harrell to press on regardless without all the necessary and time-consuming tests by Schlumberger being completed. Rogue numbers in further tests are waved away as 'glitches'. A familiar story of corporate greed and pressure overriding the expert's better judgment.When disaster strikes it strikes quickly, with some spectacular and exciting special effects that leave the audience especially hot under the collar. Female support is provided by the comely Andrea Fleytas (Gina Rodriguez), given the almost impossible job of keeping the floating bomb on station as chaos reigns about her. As an audience we are back on familiar ground here from classic Irwin Allen disaster movies such as ""The Towering Inferno"" and ""The Poseidon Adventure"". Who will make it, and who won't?A more telling question here is ""Do we care?"" and unfortunately for the film, the answer is ""Not really"". This feels a callous thing to say when this was a real and recent event and eleven people and – as touchingly illustrated at the end of the film in tribute – many of them family men with young kids, never went home again. But film-wise, we only really get bought into the fate of Williams, whose back-story, with cute wife (Kate Hudson) and cute daughter (Stella Allen) we get to meet and sympathize with. We get a minimalist view of Fleytas's backstory, but only enough to provide a recurring ""Mustang"" reference. And that's it. All the other characters are just two-dimensional ""rig crew"": cannon-fodder for the special effects team. The screenplay by Matthew Sand and Matthew Carnahan really doesn't deliver enough heft to get us bought in.While the special effects are good, the sound design isn't, with much of the dialogue being incomprehensible.All the acting is fine, with the ever-watchable John Malkovich nicely portraying the corporate head you love to hate. Wahlberg as well delivers enough range to make you forget in this ""action mode"" that he was also in ""Ted"". And Rodriguez as a junior lead holds her own against the big guns in what is a creditable performance in a big film role for her. While ""Lone Survivor""/""Battleship"" director Peter Berg neatly provides an insight into life on and around rigs, and (via subtitles) descriptions of the drilling process which I found interesting, this comes down to the sum of a tense build up, an hour of frenetic disaster, and then a whimper of an ending. Where were some of the dramatic scenes of conflict in the congressional hearing that the film's opening implies might come? Where are the scenes of ecological disaster and local financial ruin to add emotional angles to the story? None of this is really exploited and the whole concoction comes across a bit ""meh"" as a result. Not a bad film by any means. But not one I will remember in a month or two's time.(Agree? Disagree?

11,questl-18592,BP Sucks,9/10,23 May 2021,"I have the gentlemen over at CinemaSins to thank for making aware of this one because, honestly, I don't know that I would've ever gotten around to it otherwise. I generally don't care for Wahlberg and don't seek out his movies and this one doesn't seem to be getting the same kind of love as some other films.This was a tremendous movie that, having just watched it minutes ago, still has me a little revved up. Easily the best Wahlberg performance I've ever seen and honestly, he's not even in as much of it as expected. This is so much about the crew, about everyone aboard the rig. Yes, some people get more time but everyone here is really doing great work.What really makes it stand out though and what I think other films could learn from this is the art of building and then releasing pressure. Ironic, given that it's also a critical feature of the plot. Deepwater starts out generic and simple enough, people going about their lives leading up to their next stint on the rig. Once we land on that rig though, tensions start to build and build and build and you just know at some point it's going to burst and even knowing that, when it finally does it grabs hold and refuses to let go.This turned from drama to very real horror movie so fast. It was shocking in all the right ways and that maintains through the end and just... Wow. There's so much going on here and while it may not always have the best polish, it all works exceedingly well.This is a really strong recommend to anyone that hasn't seen it. The fact that it's based on a true story only adds further weight to the actions on screen and I really worry that this is going to be one of those tremendous movies that doesn't get the love it deserves.",Deepwater Horizon,1860357
12,subxerogravity,A great movie worth of the IMAX experience.,8/10,30 September 2016,"Very action packed! very suspenseful!! I feel that I was right there with the crew of the Deepwater Horizon when it went up in flames. I could feel the heat and I could feel the pressure. Definitely worthy paying extra for the good seats. As a movie, I'm a huge fan of director, Peter Berg as a filmmaker. I really like how he portrays real life heroes. Mark Wahlberg, gives a stunning performance in this film. I got good emotion from him. It was almost like watching Tom Hanks for a brief second. Also love watching Kurt Russell in the film as well. I think this is the first time Russell and his step sister, Kate Hudson were in a movie together. Deepwater Horizon was really fast paced and devastating. It's not entirely an action movie or a disaster movie,but this drama contains elements that work as one. Making it such a well rounded film.",Deepwater Horizon,1860357
13,Tweetienator,Well Done,6/10,18 October 2021,"A solid disaster flick with some good production and acting, the first half is a little too slow for my taste but after the catastrophe strikes Deepwater Horizon rolls on like a beast.

14,mark-durfor,Deepwater Horizon Is Explosive,8/10,27 September 2016,"In April of 2010, an offshore drilling rig named Deepwater Horizon exploded resulting in the worst oil spill in U. S. History. If you've read my previous reviews about Eddie the Eagle, Steve Jobs, The Big Short and Spotlight, you know that it's easy to get caught up in the details of how much of the story based on actual events really happened and how much was embellished or altered to make a Hollywood movie. Along the way, I have made a decision to do no research into the facts of the real-life story and just focus solely on the movie itself. I mean, the movie makes no claims to be a historically accurate documentary, so I shouldn't hold it to those standards. And this blog isn't about movies being historically accurate when they don't necessarily claim to be. It's based on two factors: how accurately the movie is portrayed by its preview, and the likelihood of the movie making it to my home collection. With that in mind, here's my review:Mark Wahlberg plays Mike Williams who works on the drilling rig the Deepwater Horizon. But that's the third thing we learn about Williams from the preview. He's a husband and a father first. He says goodbye to his family before being flown by helicopter with his crew to the rig. All his daughter wants is a dinosaur fossil. All his wife (Kate Hudson) wants is for him to return safely. Once aboard the rig, an executive named Vidrine (John Malkovich) and others from British Petroleum are more than anxious to commence with drilling. They skip a concrete test and excuse a failed system test. They are already 43 days behind and over budget and will do whatever it takes to not fall further behind despite Mister Jimmy's (Kurt Russell) stern objections. They should have listened to Mister Jimmy because everyone's worst nightmares explode into reality. Deepwater Horizon marks the reunion of Director Peter Berg and Mark Wahlberg who collaborated on Lone Survivor three years ago. It was nominated for Oscars for Sound Mixing and Sound Editing and won the Screen Actors Guild Award for best stunt team performance. While Wahlberg has been nominated for his roles in The Fighter and The Departed, he's one of those reliable actors who makes smart choices. If you've liked one thing Wahlberg has done, odds are,you'll like them all. Most of them won't get nominated for awards, but they will all be entertaining. Berg is in the same category. He's directed some really good movies (Lone Survivor, Battleship, Hancock,The Kingdom), but none that would really break into a critic's top 50 list. Like Wahlberg, if you enjoyed one of Berg's movies, odds are, you'll at least feel you got your money's worth with all of them. From the preview, I said that Deepwater Horizon looked action-packed and visually stunning, but that it also looked predictable with pieces of the rig falling apart or blowing up blocking every turn as Williams and the survivors try to find a way to escape. I anticipated 3 Stars but I'm bumping that up to 4.0 Stars. It was exactly as the preview said it would be and it was absolutely predictable; however, even though you knew what was coming, it was so perfectly executed, it still shocked you. From the beginning, there was no doubt about the fate of the rig as not-so-subtle clues were dropped along the way from his daughter's school presentation, to the tie of the executive, to the helicopter ride to the rig. You knew it was going to happen, but when it did, it choked the breath right out of you and didn't give it back until the very end of the movie. It is worth the money to watch in theatres. Though I'm not sure I'll be owning Deepwater Horizon, I will be watching it again.",Deepwater Horizon,1860357
15,brankovranjkovic,Environmental disaster? What environmental disaster!,3/10,4 October 2016,"This is a tribute movie about the 2010 BP oil disaster that focuses on the events leading up to and including the terrible explosions that created the oil spill.It shows the human side of the riggers, as they go about their daily routines. Their thick Texan accents were hard to follow (for me at least), and their dialogue definitely was designed to shows how tough oil riggers really are. The BP corporate management staff on the rig are all portrayed as 'idiots', who were continuously taking shortcuts trying to moderate the project deadline (already overrunning by 43 days).The first half of the movie was a slow burn, building the characters, which were very cliché. The 'disaster' second half section plays out more like a Michael Bay's noisy action movie, with loads of special effects and the standard 'shaky' cam.After a while, I actually got a bit tired and bored of all the stuff exploding, banging, and smoky scenery. This movie is more concerned with the special effects, rather than the environmental fallout from the disaster.",Deepwater Horizon,1860357

17,deschreiber,serious subject turned into empty action flick,4/10,5 October 2016,"This was a major disappointment. Despite so much of the story depending on technical details, the movie communicated next to nothing. In the early scenes on the rig, people were shouting at each other, unable to understand each other because of the background noise. However, the audience was made to suffer the same thing, having no idea what people were saying. It turns out they were asking if a ""cement test"" had been completed, and after some time, after they were indoors and checked with various people, they discovered that the test had not been completed. So why was the audience made to go through the nonsense of not hearing what people were saying? It seemed a ridiculous plot point to portray in such an annoying way. The significance was that the test had not been completed, not that it took a few minutes to find that fact out because it was too noisy outside for people to talk.Then began a number of discussions about technical matters. Little effort was made to help the audience understand any of it. Even the few diagrams and supposed shots of what was happening beneath the waves were far from enlightening. I think we were just supposed to let us the technical talk slide over us as mumbo-jumbo only engineers would understand. For my part, I began to think I'd rather have been watching a PBS documentary about the incident that so that I would know exactly what happened.Once the disaster begins, very little effort is made to continue the narrative. There's a skeleton story of a few crew members saving each other and trying to get off the rig, but the vast majority of the time we just see explosions and flying debris, over and over and over, an endless series of quick cuts, each scene lasting only a few seconds, with lots and lots of noise, of course. Despite the action and colour and noise, it all became a tiresome. At the end of the movie we see photos of the actual people involved in the incident. None of them, of course, looked like glamorous movie stars like Marky Marky or Kate Hudson. The roles required no great acting talent. Did the producers really have to hire big-name Hollywood names to fill those roles (one of the producers was Marky Mark). It seemed to be a great opportunity to use some lesser-known actors.",Deepwater Horizon,1860357
18,gregsrants,"Good, just not emotionally draining",6/10,18 September 2016,"We all remember the images of the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. Millions of gallons of oil spewed from the ocean floor for 87 days all captured and broadcast with a live internet feed. It was the worst oil spill in US history and BP oil has paid over $70 billion in fines and clean-up efforts.But what you might not remember is that the spill occurred when the floating oil rig Deepwater Horizon suffered a catastrophic explosion which resulted in the loss of 11 crew lives. Director Peter Berg (Lone Survivor) again teams up with actor Mark Wahlberg in an attempt to bring the fascinating and heroic story to audiences in the action-biopic Deepwater Horizon.Wahlberg plays Mike Williams who was the chief electronics technician for Transocean on the Deepwater Horizon. Scheduled to work upon the oil rig for just a few weeks, Williams along with Transocean offshore installation manager Jimmy Harrell (played by Kurt Russell) quickly identify that BP has cut corners with safety measures in an attempt to hit production targets. ""Money, money, money"" one of the operators sings as his conclusion to BP's negligence.Concerns represented by Williams and Harrell do little to convince on-site BP officials to radically change course and slow operations until all safety precautions have been taken. Their disregard resulted in a high pressure methane gas explosion that engulfed the rig platform. One hundred and five crew members were on board when the explosion took place at approximately 9:45PM CMT. Ninety-Four were rescued. Eleven crew were never found.Wahlberg and Russell are both convincing in their respective roles. It might be difficult in theory to rationalize Wahlberg as an electronics technician, but the versatile actor convincingly plays a smart family-oriented blue-collar worker and the ultimate hero of the film.Much of the first reel deals with BP's neglect and the conflict with the experienced workers aboard the rig. The unflattering digs are not discreet and we imagine that BP in no way will be exultant to see how Matthew Michael Carnahan and Matthew Sand's screenplay shines the light on corporate greed. Berg does his best to try and describe the safety tests that took place aboard the vessel, but it's not until the first explosion that audiences will become engaged in the horrific ordeal.Berg is no stranger to blowing things up. We all want to forget 2010's Battleship, but it likely did expose Berg to A-Level special effects and they are on full display here. The Deepwater Horizon replica is considered the largest set ever built and Berg most have took delight in completely devastating the platform with pyro techniques and theatre rattling explosions. Kurt Russell ran through fires and explosions in 1991's Backdraft, but things are turned up a notch here.As an action film, Deepwater Horizon works wonderful well. For certain, audiences will not bored through the blasts and heroics of our protagonists. Where the film does falter is in its emotional appeal. Although we get a small glimpse into the home life of Mike Williams (his wife is played by Kate Hudson who acts with father Kurt Russell for the first time), the film doesn't pull at the heartstrings for the eleven souls lost that fateful April evening. They are memorialized before the end credits role, but they are lost in the shuffle of action packed sequences that consume the 107-minute running time of Deepwater Horizon.The film is still important. It is important that we learn from our mistakes and that we remember the fallen. It's just unfortunate that Berg was unable to take a gallant story and turn it into something that acted as historical reference, casual entertainment and emotional groundwork that would evoke change in big industry standards.",Deepwater Horizon,1860357
19,bartonj2410,Very good disaster movie that highlights both bravery and helplessness,8/10,30 September 2016,"It wasn't until the credits started to roll at the end of Deepwater Horizon that I realised just how severe this disaster actually was. I mean, the above poster shows just a glimpse of the devastation caused by an explosion and subsequent fire on the Deepwater Horizon, an oil rig around 40 miles southeast off the Louisiana coast.As a result, an oil spill that released an estimated 210 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico lasted for 87 days and went down as the worst oil spill in U.S. history. Not only that but eleven workers on the rig died trying to get to safety from such a powerful environmental occurrence.Peter Berg's Deepwater Horizon follows the crew on that infamous day; firstly as they debate with BP executives over the stability of the rig and then as they try to survive the inferno. Like his last film, Lone Survivor, Peter Berg tells the story of a real life event with a huge amount of respect for the people that were caught up in it all. Once again, Berg has teamed up with Mark Wahlberg and it's no coincidence that Wahlberg gives his best performance since he last worked with Berg. The two will work together again in Patriots Day, a film about the Boston Marathon bombing, and if they stick to the trend of their collaborative relationship, we should be in for another very good film.Wahlberg is joined by a pretty impressive ensemble cast that includes Kurt Russell, John Malkovich, Dylan O'Brien and Kate Hudson. It's Malkovich who stands out as the detestable BP executive hell bent on getting the crew to drill for oil, even with the signs of an unstable rig.The film is well made and ends up being pretty spectacular when it gets going however, what Berg does best is the tension he creates as the disaster draws ever closer. You feel the presence of the oil blowout as this unstoppable monster that brings with it an extreme wrath of fire.As he did with Lone Survivor, Berg closes the film out with photos of those lost in the events that have unfolded to give the film a real sense of respect and honour. Maybe it's just me but I found it pretty disrespectful for people to be leaving the cinema as these showed on screen. Do you really need to get to your car that quick?Deepwater Horizon isn't trying to show off at all, as it probably would do if Michael Bay was at the helm. Instead, it's a film that does well to depict the desperation and bravery of those on board the Deepwater Horizon oil rig during a time of helplessness against such a force of nature.",Deepwater Horizon,1860357
20,agmoldham,Not totally sure of the point of this movie,5/10,13 October 2016,"Turned up at the cinema to find that our chosen movie was sold out, so decided to take a punt on Deepwater Horizon. I'm not sure whether it's possible to put a spoiler into this as most people will already be fully aware of the story line. I really can't see the point of the movie because of this. If you have spent the past few years is isolation then the movie tells the story of the Deepwater Horizon oil drilling platform in the Gulf Of Mexico. They are drifting behind schedule and starting to take short cuts in an attempt to reduce costs and save time.I'm a fan of Wahlberg and Malkovich, so some of their scenes were enjoyable to watch. Think the movie may have been better if it focused more on Mike Williams and less on the event. A lot of the dialogue was a bit clunky though and felt like it had been lifted from the investigations. There were also a couple of very contrived scenes. The film does give you a flavour of what it must have been like to be on the Deepwater Horizon. Maybe that was the point of it.",Deepwater Horizon,1860357
21,lee_eisenberg,BP deserves the full criticism,5/10,27 May 2017,"Peter Berg's ""Deepwater Horizon"" would've been better had it concentrated directly on BP's irresponsibility and ensuing cover-up. Instead, most of the movie is more like an action flick, with explosions and people running in every direction. While the movie did make clear the executives' disdain of safety concerns, it should've shown the complete destruction caused by the spill, and how BP stationed armed guards to prevent anyone from filming what was going on. Not to mention CEO Tony Hayward's tone-deaf remarks (""The Gulf of Mexico is pretty big, so not much got damaged"" and ""I want my life back""). This unnatural disaster was a second major blow to Louisiana after Hurricane Katrina. It should have been the indisputable call to reject fossil fuels.As for the movie's plot, Mark Wahlberg's character is the only one who really has any depth. The movie could have been so much more.

22,rockman182,Deepwater Horizon (2016),6/10,20 December 2016,"Peter Berg is a fairly streaky director. He's had some pretty bad films (both Hancock and Battleship) come to mind but then again Lone Survivor was not bad and had some gripping action. I think Berg is in a place where he trusts an actor and trusts the formula of bringing a real life event to the screen. That's basically where Mark Wahlberg and his past, present and future film is (Lone Survivor, Deepwater Horizon, and Patriots Day). As mentioned earlier Lone Survivor's depiction of war and the action based cinematography kept your eyes glued to the screen, so how would the followup film stack up? The trailers for the film were not interesting. The Deepwater Horizon oil spill and explosion was obviously a disaster and a sad event but was it worth a film? The build to the events of the disaster are slow. You sit through a lot of the jargon of the oil drilling world. I'd say its easy to lose interest in the first third of the film, especially if you don't get invested in the film's characters. You also have to sit through some bad accents (which is a pet peeve of mine). The films got a fairly good cast to boot and for the most part there are no faults acting wise. Gina Rodriguez was convincing, I haven't seen anything with her previously but she delivered. I also liked Kate Hudson in the small doses of the film that she appears in. She seemed like a raw character who was genuinely afflicted with her husbands situation and the up in the air nature of his safety really showed through in the emotion of her character.I'm a fan of Mark Wahlberg. He doesn't always choose the best projects but he might be on to something co-oping with Peter Berg for a few films. You won't complain about Wahlberg being the hero here. Once the disaster occurs the pace picks up which is a good and bad thing. I'd say the first act was not very engaging and sort of set the tone for the rest of the film. The action depiction is great. There are moments of it that will captivate you and depending on who you are you will be moved with the raw emotion depicted in the film. Be warned though, that the event is prolonged so there's not much else going on outside of the event. I saw a lot of similar camera-work from Berg in this and Lone Survivor. The camera at times seems to be a spectator just set as a fly on the wall for the events. The camera-work also becomes frenetic and pacy, which adds to the atmosphere set by the very scary and unpredictable event.Once the disaster occurs and the film really starts rolling, there is decent satisfaction. I thought this film was better than I hoped, which is really much better than my expectations going in. However, its not a perfect film and can't stay wholly engaging. Worth a watch for the peeps who like Berg/Wahlberg or are fascinated by the event. Otherwise, your response to this film may (much like mine) be rather indifferent.6/10",Deepwater Horizon,1860357
23,Leofwine_draca,A high-quality Hollywood disaster flick,7/10,12 July 2017,"DEEPWATER HORIZON is a Hollywood disaster flick based on a true story and filmed in the same gritty, hand-held style as something like UNITED 93 or CAPTAIN PHILLIPS; in other words, Paul Greengrass is a big influence. The film is gripping and engaging, cleverly building the tension early on with hints at what could go wrong and involving the viewer in some surprisingly realistic interplay between the characters.The worst thing about this film is the extraneous sub-plot involving Kate Hudson's at-home wife. She adds nothing to the story whatsoever, only serving to drag it down and spoil the pace at times. This leads to the film's opening sequence, which is literally the worst part of it, totally boring and without merit. The story should just have started with Mark Wahlberg arriving on the oil rig for work. Still, things only get better, and when the disaster occurs in the second half this is thrilling stuff indeed, hard-edged and complemented by strong CGI effects. Wahlberg is fine, but I found Kurt Russell to be the heart and soul of the piece. DEEPWATER HORIZON is miles ahead of rival fare like 2012 and SAN ANDREAS in terms of quality.",Deepwater Horizon,1860357
24,mindgem,Typical American Hero story but false,3/10,11 October 2016,"It's an interesting story but it just fall flat when they push that American hero nonsense in there just because they can't paint out America or Americans as anything but heroes even though this oil spill was really bad.spoilers coming up.So at one point one crew member wanted to push a button that would seal something, possibly preventing the spread of fire but she didn't have authority to do so so she couldn't even though it probably would have been the difference in life of others. So they drag the captain up to the bridge so they could hold his busted hands and push the button with his finger...now that's nonsense. They want to portrait these guys as heroes, no way they did that in real life. Get off it.So first I got salty about all those hero stuff but then I really got sour when they all (but 11 I think) got rescued and started praying to god. Now what the hell, there's just been a major tragedy, lives were lost, oil would contaminate the water and they uniformly decides to read bed time stories to pray to God. That takes the cake for me. Don't push your God-crap on me, that also didn't happened in real life.So great shots, good acting, interesting story but those two ingredients destroyed this picture for me.",Deepwater Horizon,1860357
25,miguelneto-74936,"Visually impeccable, but it has a bad narrative and a weak direction",4/10,3 March 2017,"Deepwater Horizon is the type of film that technically impresses, but in rest is of medium to low, the cast is very good, but was very poorly used, I found the script weak, and the direction also weak of the Peter Berg, The pace is slow, the film has tense moments, but not enough to stay, Mark Wahlberg even does a good performance, the special effects impresses, the last minutes of the film are tense and are visually impressive, but the pace is slow, The director also could not change the direction of the film, and also he did not take all the potential of the actors, this is one of the negatives Deepwater Horizon is not a bad movie, it's a weak movie that sins in many ways, it could have been a lot better.

I didn't actually realise how big the explosion was and the film Wass excellent balance between what happened and the causes of the explosion. I noticed in typical American style the American flag was still flying without getting burnt but I can forgive this patrioritism.

27,rmax304823,Watch Out For That Traveling Crown Block!,4/10,25 May 2017,"I believe one of the producers was Mark Wahlberg, who also stars. Too bad. His writers and his own judgment failed him. When it comes to special visual effects it's possible to go too far -- and they have gone it.The first twenty minutes are kind of interesting. We get to know the characters, like a grizzled Kurt Russel who manages the rig, Wahlberg who is the chief electronic technician, and John Malkovitch, who is not one of the worker ants but rather seems to represent the suits who own the rig, Burns Phillips. It's a little hard to tell. It's a little hard to tell anything about the people or the operations or the rig itself. You see, I am only five years old and I need the pace of the exposition to be slowed down so I can understand the meaning of terms like crack block, feeder pump, boom, operative covering, and cement block. I'm smart, so I figured out p.s.i. all by myself. I never did figure out why some of the jiggling needles on the gauges caused concern while others didn't. Malkovitch is treated as the villain of the piece but I don't know why, since his suggestions sounded sensible enough to me. But then, though I'm smart, my intuitive faculty is impaired.There's a lot of bonhommie aboard the Deepwater Horizon, which floats and isn't set on piles, and which has a bridge from which the screws are operated and all that. It's really a big flat boat. There's even an attractive young lady who works on the bridge. Everybody knows everybody else and there are running gags expressing the extent of Gemeinchaft. It all reminded me of the opening scenes of ""The Perfect Storm"" except these blue-collar types are pretty well set. Life aboard one of these rigs is deliberately made pleasant for the crew, otherwise why would they work on them? The cuisine is described in other sources as four star. There's booze available too. Everything is as comfortable as practicable only no smoking.That's the first twenty minutes. The rest is a breathless explosion of CGIs and special visual effects. The wretched drill blows out and we see a gusher of mud and/or oil, which then is ignited and burns eleven men to a crisp, while wounding most of the others. There is no pause. The structure blows up piece by piece with no explanation of what the hell is going on. An hour of solid flame, terror, flying debris, and blood. As a five year old, I loved it. It's hard to imagine what other audience it's aimed at. It's just that even at my tender age it's possible to reach a point of genuine satiation. Of the performances, only one stands out. The bewhiskered Malkovitch is a magnetic Cajun speaking in a memorable dialect.",Deepwater Horizon,1860357
28,Mcduff3601,Excellent action/suspense movie but....,7/10,12 March 2020,"I can't speak to how realistic this movie is I don't know the details. This was a real event and people lost their lives. But for the conversations and details within the movie I am not sure how accurate it is but it doesn't matter if you want a good fast paced tense movie this is a good one. I have mixed feelings about it, the movie focuses on the oil rig workers and really focuses on putting the blame on the BP execs and basically saying they forced us into this situation. Which might be how it happened.They show the real folks at the end of the movie so I am sure you can dig into the actual facts and I know BP was sued or fined billions of dollars over this. It was interesting to see the life on an oil rig and show just how scary things can get if things go wrong.There are lots of scenes of people getting hurt or killed so if you are sensitive to that don't watch. Otherwise its a solid movie and great acting from Mark and Kurt.

29,Prismark10,Spilled venture,5/10,3 November 2018,"Deepwater Horizon charts the story of one of the worst environmental disasters in history. BP cut corners, did not do proper safety tests that led to death and destruction.Set in 2010 in the Gulf of Mexico. Deepwater Horizon is an exploration oil rig hired by BP for deepwater drilling.We get to meet the crew. Grizzled veteran Jimmy Harrell (Kurt Russell) is the supervisor, safety conscious and suspicious of the men in suits who he thinks are bean counters and not concerned about safety.Mike Williams (Mark Wahlberg) is the electronics technician. The villain of the piece, representing BP management is Donald Vidrine (John Malkovich.)The build up to disaster takes half the movie and frankly the first half is not very gripping. The second part of the movie deals with the disaster. When things go wrong, there is chaos. The oil gushes out, there are explosions, fires are started, water and mud is coming in and people are in jeopardy.Only Malkovich makes an impression with a laconic performance.

31,tomgillespie2002,True-life story realistically brought to life but avoiding the bigger picture,6/10,28 January 2017,"Reuniting with his Lone Survivor (2013) leading man Mark Wahlberg and telling another true-life tale of down-to-earth, blue-collar guys caught up in a horrendous, avoidable situation, Peter Berg tackles the events leading up to and during the explosion of the titular Deepwater Horizon Mobile Drilling Unit and the subsequent offshore oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. Berg opts to tell the story in the mould of a classic disaster movie, introducing the various characters that are inevitably destined to be caught up in the chaos, before delivering the movie's big set-piece; a massive, devastating explosion of fire and oil, dramatically and realistically brought to life by the 85%-to- scale set. While it makes for an entertaining and exciting picture (hardly necessities for a true-life tragedy), it misses the opportunity to explore the bigger picture.Returning to Deepwater Horizon after shore leave, engineer Mike Williams (Wahlberg) arrives at the floating rig to find that not all the workers are happy or comfortable with the actions of the company men. Mike and respected supervisor Mr. Jimmy (Kurt Russell) are shocked to learn that the men responsible for conducting a pressure test have been sent home early under the orders of BP man Vidrine (John Malkovich), without carrying out the routine safety inspections. A lot of the dialogue is naturalistic but muffled, meaning that the necessary exposition required to understand the workings of the rig and the reasons for the pending disaster can confuse. One of the opening scenes sees Mike explain his job to his young daughter who is preparing for a class talk. She seemed to get it but I didn't, but it's clear enough that something isn't quite right.Berg's decision to keep the CGI trickery to an absolute minimum certainly pays off, and allows cinematographer Enrique Chediak to capture the sheer scale of the event to full effect. While there are some invisible special effects at work, the whole ordeal feels entirely real, bolstered by some terrifying, Oscar-nominated sound editing. Yet in aiming to deliver an action movie so focused on the immediacy of the event and the swift actions of those on board, it loses sight of the bigger picture at play. Namely, the unforgivable misconduct and irresponsibility of BP, who endangered the life of every man and woman on board in fear of being behind schedule, and the resulting oil spill which devastated wildlife and could be seen from space. For me at least, that sounds like a more interesting and engrossing movie. Still, Berg's picture is well made, handsomely performed, and, most importantly, doesn't feel superficial.",Deepwater Horizon,1860357
32,filipemanuelneto,"Very well-balanced, the film does not tire us and provides good entertainment.",6/10,18 November 2022,"Disaster and accident films are common, although I feel that, for the last ten years, this has been an underexplored genre. The film is based on a true incident where a massive oil drilling rig suffered critical safety failures, eventually catching fire and collapsing. After investigations, the inadequate operation of a team that was supposed to place a cement lining in the hole opened by the platform was responsible for what happened, as well as the lack of maintenance of the equipment, all situations that would have been avoided if the company contracting the platform, BP, had really been less avaricious in relation to the costs and delays of the undertaking.The film is quite good, it offers us quality entertainment without major flaws, but this does not mean that it is free from important criticism. In fact, the script could be better if there wasn't such a long delay, at the beginning of the film, to reach the platform. I got the idea that the film takes a long time to gain interest and wastes time, in this initial phase, with aspects of lesser relevance. I also felt that it ends very abruptly, without much consideration being given, beyond the statements in the later process.Observing the way the film was structured and thought out, it becomes quite obvious that Mark Wahlberg was thought of as the protagonist, the main actor of the film. However, the truth is that the actor erases himself throughout the film and seems to avoid appearing or doing anything that makes him heroic and worthy of this role. Personally, I think it's one of the weakest and most uninteresting performances by the actor, whose merits, abilities or talent - caveat - are not up for debate. Much better, stronger, more impactful and more present on screen, Kurt Russell deserves praise for a job well done. He steals attention whenever he appears or says something. I also enjoyed the contributions by Gina Rodríguez and John Malkovich.The film had the competent direction of Peter Berg. He was not always successful in his efforts, there are actually some issues of rhythm and editing that should have been worked on better, but it ends up deserving a very positive note, especially if we take into account that he managed to prevent a film so susceptible to eventual CGI overdoses to be turned into an avalanche of effects and technical resources without script support. This is a recurring flaw in disaster movies, and we've seen how much it hurt other productions, like ""2012"", for example. The resources are here, the CGI is very evident in the film, and it is, in fact, striking and imposing, but it is not absorbing to the point of making us feel like we are watching something fictional. Another point of success in the technical aspects of this film is the subtle harmony between the construction and development of the characters and the tension that, gradually and unhurriedly, builds up until the accident. A truly realistic scenario and good costumes and soundtrack complete the technical composition of a film that does not tire us and entertains us without being a masterpiece.",Deepwater Horizon,1860357

First show how good and professional and real people are the heroes of the story, demonize the middle management who wants to get things done hoping it will all be OK and risking everybody's lives, express the idea that money hungry sons of bitches are to blame, then blow everything up.The film presents only the actual event, with lots of fire, explosions, blow outs and debris flying everywhere. The lower on the corporate ladder people are the more heroic they appear. That's dramatization for you. I would have loved to have a small part in the end dedicated to the BP cover up and the legal mess afterwards, but they kept quiet. I don't even know if it was all cleared up by 2010. However, you should look up Peter Berg's article about BP's interference with the movie. Just look for ""The 'well from hell' – my fight with BP to film Deepwater Horizon"" and you'll find it.Bottom line: classic disaster movie, with a straight story of the event, rather than the entire political and legislative chaos that ensued.",Deepwater Horizon,1860357

Jimmy Harrell (Kurt Russell) is the supervisor and Mike Williams (Mark Wahlberg) is the chief technician of Deepwater Horizon. BP managers Donald Vidrine (John Malkovich) and Robert Kaluza (Brad Leland) are cutting corners and canceling vital tests. They push the delayed schedule which leads to a big explosion and environmental devastation.The action, the true-life story, and the characters are all very compelling. I rarely wish for more expositions but the film could use some to lay out the ocean oil drilling operation. Peter Berg tries to do a little with the can of soda. The film is not actually confusing but a detailed explanation could help lay down the foundation. This is more of an action thriller. The crew of the Deepwater Horizon is left blameless while BP and the two managers are made as the sole villains. I don't disapprove but it's a little simplistic.

36,Horst_In_Translation,"Overdue movie, solid execution",6/10,4 April 2017,"""Deepwater Horizon"" is an American film from 2016 that is actually based on an article and was directed by Peter Berg. Berg has worked with Mark Wahlberg on other occasions as well, so it is not really a surprise the two reunited for this one here. The film managed (a bit surprisingly if I remember correctly) two Academy Award nominations in the technical categories, but lost out to ""The Jungle Book"" and ""Arrival"". It runs for 107 minutes, but admittedly this includes almost 15 minutes of credits at the end, so the real runtime is just slightly over 1.5 hours basically and nowhere near Wahlberg's longest works. The title already gives away a crucial reference to the subject here, namely the oil rig catastrophe from April 2010, roughly seven years ago now. This is definitely a subject that deserves its own movie to let more people know about it, also for future generations in the next decades. The execution was okay overall. I agree that there are moments when the film becomes a bit generic and feels like it could have been about any other catastrophe too, but as a whole, it's still a solid movie.The film depicts the time directly before the catastrophe and shortly afterward. There is no emphasis on the massive environmental damage that was done. The first 60% of the film, i.e. everything before disaster strikes, were probably better because afterward it develops into a bit of a generic action film really, even if these later sequences probably resulted in the Oscar nominations. Then again, the first half has John Malkovich (and Kurt Russell), so naturally it is the superior part of the film. Wahlberg is okay as well, but sadly his character is a tad too perfect once again as he sees through the problems, is not scared of authority (i.e. Malkovich) and just turns into that huge savior at the end. But he is still a million times better than Golden Globe winner Gina Rodriguez in here, even if it is not really her fault as her character was completely insignificant and pointless the way it was written and probably only included to have any females in here at all. Then again, Oscar nominee Kate Hudson would have been enough as she does a pretty solid job too with the little she was given. She is the connection between Wahlberg's professional and family life in here and even if she is seen only on a webcam except very early and very late, she still manages to be 10 times as memorable as Rodriguez. All in all, the film is probably not as good as it could have been, but overall the focus was right and it's a good thing that it was made. I give ""Deepwater Horizon"" a thumbs-up and recommend it particularly to those with an interest in the subject or those who like fact-based action films or just those who like Mark Wahlberg and/or the supporting players. If neither description fits you, you can skip it.",Deepwater Horizon,1860357
37,Mivas_Greece,"Realistic acting and effects when Deepwater Horizon exploded, set on fire and collapsed. Very realistic film of that real accident.",7/10,28 February 2021,"Drama/history/accident film based on a true story. This is the biggest accident in the history of the oil industry in the US, which occurred in 2010. The first half of the film is something meaningless and perhaps boring, the film tries to show us some deepwater horizon crew members, but it should be shorter. The second half is the accident itself, where the pressure of the underwater pipe is high and defuses initially but then follows an explosion and the Deepwater Horizon is engulfed in flames and gradually collapses. Crew members try to survive and fight against time, explosions and flames. In the end it shows the real characters as well as some of the victims of the accident. An overall pretty good effort, although it could have been better, filling more in the second half of the film and reducing the first half that was pretty meaningless. As a whole it is recommended, and both Wahlberg and Kurt Russell are very good at their role.

The corporate complications are very well covered in the catfish analogy. One would like to think ""lessons"" have been ""learned"", but I have my doubts.Synopsis:
On April 20, 2010, the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explodes in the Gulf of Mexico, igniting a massive fireball that kills several crew members. Chief electronics technician Mike Williams (Mark Wahlberg) and his colleagues find themselves fighting for survival as the heat and the flames become stifling and overwhelming. Banding together, the co-workers must use their wits to make it out alive amid all the chaos.

40,gemidori,"By far the best ""based on a real life disaster"" film I've seen.",8/10,22 June 2021,"I would like to immediately affirm that I'm not an expert in engineering, nor do I know anything regarding oil manufacturing. However, I can confirm that I did know about the 2010 BP oil spill when it happened. I was a kid, so I knew very little apart from it being a disaster that caused heavy negative environmental impact.A documentary, film or not, is designed to teach viewers information that they wouldn't know - Deepwater Horizon succeeds with blazing colors. I now know very much about notable people aboard, such as Mike Williams and Jimmy Harrell, as well as contributing factors to the rig's failure.As this follows real life events, I can't say much about writing and story. However, the film is paced well, focusing on the whats and whys behind the spill before letting it all boil into the explosion over halfway through the film. Before the accident, the filmmakers don't slog and have the film go nowhere; they represent all workers involved, alive or dead, as best as possible, to the point where it all feels alive with the personality, humor and humanity put into the characterized people.Another commendable thing is that the film is significantly more accurate than the average Hollywood flick, thanks to the main basis being autobiographies written by survivors. Not to mention that the rig is portrayed as realistically as possible, with all the mechanisms and systems you would probably have found in a rig like the DWH rather than simplify it into a sci-fi machine. It solely focuses on the disaster itself and not the following environmental effects it resulted in; though I believe it impossible to work in the whole of the Deepwater Horizon disaster timeline into one film. While there are certain errors that I've discovered following my viewing - Vidrine and Kaluza's vilification (even if they certainly were culpable), the survivors kneeling and reciting a prayer at the end and the more dramatic circumstances behind Dale Burkeen's death (in reality, he was already in the crane trying to stop it as opposed to heading back inside of it) - they are all still forgivable in that the prayer still happened, but simply after the tragedy; Dale's self-sacrifice in this film only further emphasizes the hero he was in reality; and Malkovich and Leland's performances make the otherwise irredeemable antagonists into genuinely lovable scumbags who steal the show, mainly Malkovich.On this note, the acting from virtually every actor is at their A game, with Mark Wahlberg and Kurt Russell almost unrecognizable in their roles. They're so deep into their roles that they seem like Mike and Jimmy, walking around on the set themselves. Not far behind is the rest of the cast; Gina Rodriguez' Andrea Fleytas, the aforementioned Malkovich and even minor roles such as Mike's family being notable standouts.The effects are something to behold, as the rig is a near-exact size replica of the original, and the shots of its mud overflows, violent fires and destruction of interior areas; and especially the multiple explosions all over the rig, all look both incredible and horrifying. There are also a fair few shots of gore effects - mainly two - which are gruesome and painful to watch, yet they're still lifelike and frankly quite seamless, and the makeup showing blood or mud is stellar as well even if it's a minor touch compared to the gore and explosions.While there isn't much to say regarding music as there actually aren't many tracks I could lay an ear to, what is there sets the scenes wonderfully. Standout examples are the music that plays during Dale's last stand to save his co-workers, and the catchy though somber country tune that plays in the epilogue.Deepwater Horizon is a film that only becomes more fascinating as you learn more behind the failure of the rig, as well as how oil rigs work overall - whether certain events in the film were correct or not. Unlike its brethren, it does not overstay its welcome (Titanic) nor does it show a lack of respect toward the people who lost their lives (Pearl Harbor) - it is a film with a healthy runtime and pays great honor to those who survived and sadly perished in the spill. I wouldn't say it's next to Saving Private Ryan when it comes to excellent based-on-real-tragic-events films, but it both stands as a major highlight among real life disaster films and also a highly effective and intelligent docudrama.This film shows up often on FX - I highly recommend you watch it or even buy it on DVD. The amount of heart and research the filmmakers put into their work alone makes it worth watching.Rating - 8/10 (intense and well paced film that does not shy away from the disaster and pays great tribute to those who passed, as well as successfully immortalizing the heroic acts of those aboard the rig - all of this is supported by an excellent cast and brutally gorgeous effects, though not without the inaccuracy hiccups and occasionally humorous thick Cajun accents)",Deepwater Horizon,1860357
41,grantss,More filler than drama,4/10,5 July 2017,"In April 2010 the exploration oil rig Deepwater Horizon, stationed in the Gulf of Mexico, suffered a catastrophic disaster, exploding and being set on fire. This is the story of the lead-up to the disaster, the disaster itself and the individual actions involved, and the aftermath.More filler than drama - essentially a 40-50 minute short docudrama turned into a 107 minute movie. The remainder is just padding. Yes, I know, the idea is to engage you, the audience, by getting you to know and like the characters and thus empathize with them when disaster strikes, but here it doesn't really work. The lead-up here is dull, and the attempts at engagement overdone and overt. It also doesn't help that, having introduced you to all these characters, other than the main ones it is difficult to tell who is who when the tragedy unfolds.On that point, the action itself is difficult to follow. By trying to make things as realistic as possible, director Peter Berg also makes things more confusing, with dim/dark lighting and random, unexplained things happen. It becomes hard to tell which characters are involved or what the dangers are (other than the obvious ones, of course).While a tragedy, there's not enough detail and drama involved to make a complete movie, but it got made anyway.",Deepwater Horizon,1860357
42,deloudelouvain,A look at the environmental disaster that everyone remembers.,8/10,1 November 2017,"After watching a couple really awful movies this week I needed a movie like this one. This one I truly enjoyed. Based on a true story so it always gives the movie a bit more punch. Everybody remembers the terrible tragedy that occurred that day. Some would think it's a human tragedy but to me it's an environmental catastrophe. Millions of liters of oil devastating marine wildlife and this for decades. The movie doesn't mention anything about that, but it still remains a good movie to watch. Just to have an idea on what happens on an oil platform like that. That the big oil concerns like BP are faulty in every way is obvious. That they will never face consequences doesn't bother anybody. That's just the way it is. The mighty lobbyists win again. Mark Wahlberg gives us a good performance, as well as the other actors. The catastrophe scenes look like they are all real so for that the movie gets big credits. The story is poignant and will make everybody think about the disaster that happened there. A good catastrophe movie, even for the people that are not really into this kind of movies.

Deepwater Horizon tells a simple story, without Hollywood pathos and large-scale CGI scenes. The film has a balance, there is also a well-staged action and suspense and a good cast.

45,MatthewMichaelHoffman,A long time coming,7/10,10 June 2023,"SCORE: 6.8/10It's been a long time coming. In the summer of 2017, I worked as a Marketing Intern for the Philadelphia 76ers and one day we were tasked with moving items from one storage place to another at the Wells Fargo Center. Our managers told us that we could take some of the stuff in one corner home if we'd like, as they were looking to thin their storage space. Along with an NBA basketball from one of their games in 2014, a pair of signature shoes from Carl Landry, and a couple other items, there was a stack of unopened Deepwater Horizon Blu-ray disks that I had taken a copy of this movie from. It has traveled with me from Philadelphia in college, to Los Angeles when I graduated, and down to Orlando from the end of 2020 until now and I've never actually watched it. Until now!Deepwater Horizon is a story about an oil rig that explodes in 2010 due to the unsafe business practices of BP and their disregard for signs of danger. Those signs of danger were given multiple times by characters played by Mark Wahlberg, Kurt Russell, and Ethan Suplee aka Louie Lastik. Time has done that man so well. The acting was phenomenal, but the story was a little too surface level in my opinion. This film really thrives when it simulates moments of chaos and terror that the people at that oil rig must've been experiencing. The build up left a lot to be desired, but John Malkovich as Don Vidrine was a really strong character. I think this is a movie that everyone should watch at least once, but it's probably going to go back in its case and stay there until the end of time for me.",Deepwater Horizon,1860357

After the characters are established and the premise of the story is set, the semi-submersible offshore oil drilling rig known as Deepwater Horizon turns into a veritable fireball with employees scrambling for their lives, or in the case of the eleven who didn't make it, a final, forbidding resting place. There's just enough well drilling science interspersed throughout the story to guide the uninitiated about what happened, with a thorough indictment made against the cost cutting maneuvers of the British Petroleum honchos calling the shots. Besides what we see here, I was also expecting in some way the eventual successful effort that shut the oil spill down, but the picture really only followed the tragedy through the first few days until the surviving crew members were all rescued. One's visceral response to the blazing inferno that consumed the oil rig is tempered by the fact that this was a real event that claimed eleven lives. What's impressive is the mammoth undertaking director Peter Berg accepted when offered the challenge to make the film. Extra features on the DVD describe the formidable task, putting you right in the middle of the disaster.",Deepwater Horizon,1860357
47,phd_travel,Confusing direction during disaster sequences and incomprehnsible technical dialog,4/10,29 September 2016,Firstly the explosion and fire is filmed in a way that makes one seem right in the thick of things. Quite scary. Unfortunately things are confusing both in terms of dialog and direction.The movie starts off with some family time with Kate Hudson in a fairly convincing blue collar wife role although she is a bit slim for the role. Mark Wahlberg looks short and out of shape - he let himself go a bit for the role and that's realistic. John Malkovich plays an evil BP guy who was in a rush and caused them to proceed despite supervisor Kurt Russell's misgivings. Liked Gina Rodriguez as one of the bridge personnel caught up in the explosion.2 major faults:Confusing dialog One of the main faults is the dialog is needlessly difficult to understand with all the technical speak bantered quickly around by the cast. Didn't understand much except a few words by Kurt Russell in the meeting. There must have been an easier way to explain the problem with the pressure. Hard to tell people apart during the disaster sequences A major fault in the direction is having everyone's face covered by mud and soot. I couldn't tell who was injured and killed and when especially when it came to Ethan Suplee's character. I could make out only Mark Wahlberg and Kurt Russell but Dylan O'Brien only sporadically. Could have had a few more minutes about the investigation and aftermath and ecological impact.,Deepwater Horizon,1860357

Lot's of explosions. There is really nothing to this film... just a load of way over the top special effects with flashes, shaky camera action, explosions and whatnot. To make it worse, the camera is zoomed in - making it almost impossible to tell what is happening... although, it was probably just some piece of the rig blowing up. Additionally, the dialogue was absolutely rubbish! There was no depth or substance to it - all that we were fed was how stupid BP is. To top it off, the characters all sounded like African American gangsters, even though most of the cast was white! Finally, for some reason, the director decided to play a list of the 11 victims that lost their lives in the accident... fine, but he chose to do so at the end of the film, most of which died in the initial blast and therefore one is left wondering, ""hmm, who was that again?"".If you are looking for an interesting, well-thought out and dynamic plot, turn away!

49,RforFilm,"Oil and fire create a floating hell in Deepwater Horizon, which creates gripping recreation of the tragedy",6/10,3 October 2016,"In this day and age of climate change, the world still runs around the oil wheel. It's easy to see why it's called Texas gold; it powers so many elements we live on (vehicles, houses, machines, etc), and it's use only tends to grow. Because it's taken millions of years for this fossil fuel to develop, it's getting scarcer then ever and we've engineered ways to retrieve it deep in the ocean. As I learned at EPCOT when I was nine, most of the oil rigs in the ocean are taller then the Empire State Building. I can certainly admire how far we've come to make that vision become a reality.The darker side of the picture is that these oil rigs are owned by major companies and they make a lot of money off of this energy. This has made it easy for their greed to make the majority of the decisions, regardless of the environment. One of their decisions caused the 2010 Oil leak of the Gulf of Mexico. It spewed millions of gallons of petroleum making it the worst oil disaster in US history. The story of the ship that started it is retold in the dramatic disaster film, Deepwater Horizon. We start on the morning of April 20, 2010 where Chief Electronics Technician Mike Williams (played by Mark Wahlberg) is waking up with his wife Felicia (played by Kate Hudson). He's leaving for another round on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig, which is out on the Gulf of Mexico. Some of the other people joining his is supervisor Jimmy Harrell (played by Kurt Russell), navigation worker Andrea Fleytas (played by Gina Rodriguez) and the rest of the oil workers. Coming on board in BP (the company in charge of the Deepwater Horizon) is corporate man Donald Vidrine (played by John Malkovich).Jimmy and Mike make it clear to Donald that the ship and it's machines are in need of great repair and that it's errors have placed a lot of strain on the oil well. It seems to be releasing gas pressures higher then usual, but Donald see's this as routines and orders to run tests as scheduled. Just as history as taught us, the pressure of the petroleum proves too much, causing it to erupt and set off a series of explosions. Or that night, Deepwater Horizon became a floating Hell as the surviving oil workers get off before it's too late.Directed by Peter Berg and staring Mark Wahlberg, Deepwater Horizon has a similar feel to their previous collaboration, Lone Survivor. Again, the focus seems to be more about the experience rather then a character study. While the later felt more empty then it should have been, this style works much better here. This film is set up more like a disaster film, which means you know your going to get an exciting series of action, but not so much in character. This proves similar here as it was hard to distinguish personalities from the various people on that ship (I think they were hoping the actors playing the real life characters would fill the gaps).Much of the dialogue consists of a lot of how the oil rigs work and the controversies surrounding the age of their equipment. A lot of that was hard to follow, with the exception of the material aiming to make BP the villain here. Though I was alright with that, I could tell the majority of the audience was waiting for the rig to go off and get on with the action scenes. Had more work been put into the first half, I would have proclaimed this as one of the best of the year. But as a simple disaster movie, it was an entertaining story about survival.I'll give this six oil spill updates out of ten. Overall, I felt like the experience was genuine, but I wish the characters would have been more interesting to follow. While I'm sure they took creative liberties, this is a case in which I would have wanted more in order to make a better movie. Sometimes changes are needed to tell a better story. If you can, see this on the big screen if you really wanted to know what being on the Deepwater Horizon before that tragic oil spill.",Deepwater Horizon,1860357
50,Samiam3,Shallowwater Horizon,6/10,28 May 2017,"Director Peter Berg gives us the story of the greatest oil spill in American history. He succeeds in delivering all the damage, but fails to showcase the impact. On the grounds of drama, A movie like Deepwater Horizon will only strike oil if it is constructed as a drama about human beings, rather than a two hour treatment of a Wikipedia article. It's not a bad movie, but it has no soul. Something is missing. Deepwater horizon feels like a two act structure for a story that warrants three acts. There is a distinctive beginning, a middle and then it's just ... over.In the first part, we meet our main character (Wahlberg), his family and his co-workers. He hops a company chopper for a short flight to the Gulf of Mexico, and onto a doomed oil rig. It is there that we meet the unfavourable oil executive (Malcovich) who orders drilling to proceed after conducting a drilling pressure test that yields unsafe results. The teams starts drilling, and then mother nature fights back; flames go up. While the real person was in fact charged with criminal inelegance, Deepwater Horizon relies on our knowledge of the outcome to make Malkovich seem like the kind corporate 'bad guy'; that Hollywood loves to hate. To make matters worse, John Malkovich gives a lousy performance with an accent so phony and untraceable that you'd think he came from a planet in the Star Trek universe. As for Mark Wahlberg, for the most part he is playing himself, but in fairness the script doesn't give him much. Once the oil rig starts to go up, Deepwater Horizon succeeds in conjuring up some peril, but the camera work and lighting are highly disorienting, so after a while these scenes get tiresome. There is a brief moment near the end of the movie that is memorable because it gives a hint of what is missing. A bruised and battered Wahlberg gets out of a car, squeezes through the press and in to a building where he is met by a man who asks him what happened to his son. When he doesn't get the answer he wants, he attempts to man handle Wahlberg. What Deepwater Horizon needs is a sense of emotion impact from the turmoil, because you are left wondering how the survivors repaired their lives. another half hour of material would have helped with this. the fact that the movie denies us this renders all the family introduction scenes in act one a complete waste of time.There is more to this story than Peter Berg is able to deliver.",Deepwater Horizon,1860357

But it is a very simple plot- you know straightaway who the good guys are and who are the baddies- e.g. John Malkovich with usual sneering looks and snarky comments. Again, not surprising BP are made to be the total villains (typical of many US movies where the British are villains) while forgetting that Transocean, Halliburton and regulatory bodies were also to be faulted as well for this disaster. That only 11 people of the 126 present died despite the terrible conditions, is a testimony to the fast thinking bravery of the land based rescue teams- again underplayed due to the overemphasis on Wahlberg's character. That an actor of Kate Hudson's calibre is reduced to a pouting housewife seen from time to time (she even manages to change her nail colour in those 36 hours despite everything), is a big shame. But the biggest shame of all is that the movie barely touches on the huge environmental impact of the disaster- the only thing we see is one oil soaked bird. People's livelihood were affected- from fishermen to tourism- and the world changed. That a huge disaster on environmental and personal levels has been reduced to an big action movie, is itself a tragedy.",Deepwater Horizon,1860357
52,ghanima_atrieadies,Loved it,9/10,6 August 2021,"I love this movie. It recounts the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010 for which BP was responsible for but no justice was served.Peter Berg is one of my favorite directors namely due to The Kingdom, and he and his cast did a great job on this. His attention to detail shows through here and love that. This is not a movie that is going to win an Oscar (except for special effects) and it's not a documentary but it does show what happened and why/how it happened.I've seen reviews that bash it for not showing justice for the ecological damage and loss of life...well, there wasn't any. And those confused with the technical jargon, I'm not an oil rigger and I understood it. All you need to do is pay attention. Jimmy actually explains most of it quite well as does the BP rep.The last response to a review I read was that it wasn't emotionally draining. Anyone who says this wasn't emotionally draining has never worked rescue before. The ship that witnessed the explosion and began immediate SAR saved countless lives. The crane operator's sacrifice, and the fate of those in the drill shack should have been draining...not to mention the site of that rig in flames.",Deepwater Horizon,1860357
53,savageloki,"Nothing about the consequences, this is another shame on Hollywood",2/10,7 January 2017,"""American heroes"" are digging the Earth because of mean BP guys, so stereotypical it almost made me laugh. I should have known, Mark Wahlberg isn't really known to act in great movies but what is Malkovitch doing here ? And Kurt Russell ? It seems all these guys need more and more cash and are ready to sell every bit of them.Not a single word on the cataclysmic consequences of this ecological tragedy. Sorry, you won't make me cry for ten avid workers that are totally aware of what they're doing to the planet. No surprises, it's a classic bad Hollywood pseudo drama movie. Next.

54,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,6/10,8 January 2017,"Deepwater HorizonThe best part about offshore drilling is that you get to wear your swimsuit to work.Mind you, the rig crew in this drama should've worn flame retardant trunks.When drill crew captains Mike Williams (Mark Wahlberg) and Jimmy Harrell (Kurt Russell) board Deepwater Horizon, they discover the proper safety measures have not been taken to stabilize the well. Concerned, they urge their BP rep (John Malkovich) to authorize a pressure test.Shortly after the test commences there is a massive explosion. Now Mike must evacuate his team (Dylan O'Brien, Gina Rodriguez) before the rig collapses.Inspired by the 2010 BP oil spill, this harrowing survival story is certainly heart pounding and inspiring. However, the human component feels aggrandized, while the environmental devastation has been minimized for the sake of high-octane entertainment.Even worse, under maritime law all oil spilt into the ocean automatically becomes the property of the mer-people.

55,Semisonic,"Too technical, too messy, and arguably too glorified",6/10,2 March 2017,"Here we go again, Deepwater Horizon is a film that claims to be based on true events. Indeed, there was an oil rig by such name that made a huge mess in the Gulf of Mexico. The question is, how close this film stays true to what really happened there on April 20, 2010.Because if we judge this film by its cinematographic merit only, then it could easily be described with a concise formula: a catastrophe flick, brutal but generic. The typical build-up, with lots of banter, friendly and not so much, and a ton of techie jargon you'll hardly understand even if you could pause every now and then and look up every word. And then the typical climax, when the hell breaks loose and everyone gets their chance to reveal themselves and to be either @ssholes or heroes. And the typical finale, grim but happy, with the survivors hugging their wives and kids and exchanging those meaningful looks. If that was the first disaster movie I had seen, well, I'd probably feel absolutely satisfied. Because the disaster part of Deepwater Horizon, finally devoid of the mumbo jumbo talks and turned into a big quest of survival in a burning hell above water, is definitely gripping enough, thanks to the solid performance of Mark Wahlberg and Kurt Russell, and the impressive visuals. However, I've seen such films before, both dramatic and ridiculous, so I'm bound to wonder whether Deepwater Horizon is able to bring something new onto the table.Unfortunately, the answer is no. Last year we've seen another catastrophe film based on a real story, Sully. Well, it was not a typical catastrophe indeed, more like a catastrophe turned miracle. Still, it was a demonstration of a different approach to telling the stories of such events. And while Sully was definitely less dynamic and much more political, it was at least original. And that is the quality Deepwater Horizon isn't really able to boast.If only we could only know how much of this film is fiction and how much is based on reality indeed. Because if the filmmakers had shot Deepwater Horizon strictly in accordance with the real events, then all that purely American heroism and even the techie talks would've felt... different. That way we'd actually be able to assess the scale of stupidity and greed of the people who let that disaster happen, and the scale of heroism and sacrifice of those who were doing their best to avert that disaster, and, when the worst finally happened, were risking their lives to save those of their fellow men. That would've been a true feat deserving every praise possible. But I know Hollywood. And, while I'd like to believe that some of the exemplary behavior shown in this movie did take place that day, I'm more inclined to think that Deepwater Horizon is just a rough outline of the true story, and all those inspiring and noble actions done by Wahlberg and Co are there just for the show.",Deepwater Horizon,1860357
56,sne-14344,NO plot and highly misleading,1/10,30 September 2016,"VERY impressive: NO plot and highly misleading. Promulgates the idea that oil comes from dead dinosaurs and gives the impression that it was just 2 low-level BP guys on the rig that made the decision to cut costs by skipping a cement test and failing to keep routine maintenance top notch. No clear indictment of BP's criminal company culture of safety negligence for the benefit of stock dividends and executive remuneration, as established by Lord John Browne and continued by Tony Hayward.Much urgent and heroic pushing of buttons and switches and discussing gizmos with no explanation of what is going on or how this drilling target was geologically any different from all the other offshore locations on Earth (Macondo being unlike most other drilling targets because of extremely high fluid pressure in the formation, just below the fracture threshold of the rock layers holding the oil in). So from this movie, we get the news ALL oil drilling is SUPER dangerous. The usual Hollywood negligence to script-writing. Might be meaningful to rig workers, except I have the suspicion that anyone knowledgeable would smell plenty of foni- baloni cooking.And then the solemn photo-tribute to the 11 guys killed as the credits roll. Fine, but were they brave as they died one-by-one fighting to control the well, as the script implies? I understand that all 11 were instantly killed in the initial blast. Of course, 99.99% of the viewers will of have no idea that the Alexander Kjelland (1980) and Piper Alpha (1988) rig disasters each killed an order of magnitude more.And the only environmental representative in the movie is one bird (who, nevertheless, gave an Oscar-worthy performance).",Deepwater Horizon,1860357

58,Quinoa1984,"honest and harrowing, led by three remarkable performances",8/10,14 October 2016,"Deepwater Horizon can't help but be compared to Clint Eastwood's Sully if only because they each came out within a month of each other (if that), and they both involve hard-working, dedicated professionals at their job who pay a varying degree of prices for being at the right place but the most wrong time possible. While one certainly carries the Pedigree of Legends(TM) at the helm, I think that what makes Horizon the better movie is that Berg doesn't muck around with telling his story: these men went to this oil rig (after a safety team left very prematurely), and after a couple of Negative Impact tests the entire rig went to s*** and caught fire.No, more than that, it turned into the kind of disaster we often take for granted in big 100+ million tentpoles. Only difference here, it's not oil riggers drawn up by Michael Bay - these guys were real, and goddamn it, Peter Berg will make you KNOW it! This is a somewhat manipulative film emotionally speaking, but then Berg isn't out to make something subtle - he can't when it involves a story that is (do I have a synonym I can use for this word, nah, fine) explosive as the one he has here. Like Sully too it's not overlong, clocking in at 96 minutes. Unlike that film this doesn't have such detail into the investigation of what happened after the fact, probably because Berg and his producers and team know there's WAY more than enough drama in just detailing what happened to lead up to the explosion and how it got so out of control. It's a film cut in half structurally: the first is all set-up, giving us the dedicated workers (Mark Wahlberg as our hero, which is emphasized because he's the only one with a wife apparently with Kate Hudson on the other end; Kurt Russell as the character who may be missing from a Howard Hawks movie; John Malkovich playing his best kind of villain, which is slimy and yet icily intelligent), then the second is when things go to hell.I think the structure works well most of all for the film, and all the actors bring not just emotional intensity; Wahlberg isn't always Olivier (who ever said he was on the other hand), but put him as a commanding but unassuming blue-collar guy and he can give it a great degree of truth. It almost (no, what 'almost', it does) goes into overload in the final minutes of its climax as he and one other character are left on the oil rig, and his character hits the apex of being a Mega-Hero (part of the manipulation I think is strategic - Berg and co. know nearly everyone seeing this movie won't know if Mike Williams comes out alive at the end or not, so all the set-up with his wife and kid at home makes it seem both very obvious and very not). Meanwhile, Russell and Malkovich make good opposing figures, one all about safety as his character in the New Webster Dictionary definition under IRONY gets a safety award within minutes of the devastation, the other all about... well, his own kind of logic, but deep down all about money.If anyone brought a degree of dimension it actually was Malkovich, who certainly doesn't appear to be someone we are going to have much sympathy with - he comments at one point that BP's worth of 185 billion will go up to 186 with some extra time shaved off to get the oil out - but he also has a job to do, in his way. He seems more pathetic by the end of the film than someone who has been crushed by any other opposing force, and really the villain of the story is fate and pressing against nature: you f*** with the Earth too much and it will fight back. But there's also in Berg's vision not a heavy deal of commentary there either; if you feel guilty driving in your car from the movie theater after seeing this, it's less a direct result of the film's message than it is a by-product.If there are marks against the filmmaker it's that he brings the same hyper-kinetic shaky-camera style and editing, how he brings us into the filmic space of this location and as the situation unfolds so tragically, and it gets to be much. At times. I say that qualifier because there are some moments, mostly when characters are finding one another in the darkened and chaotic mess right after the explosion, how Mike finds Mr Jimmy and the others, and there it works well. It's when Berg has to cut between so many multiple points of view - the Coast Guard getting things together, men getting on to lifeboats, the woman being put under immense pressure at the station to get things moving (or not, under direct orders), and Kate Hudson at home - that it goes into over-drive. Not so much that I ever lost the thread or felt an emotional disconnect, but it did remind me in an uncanny way ""hey, it's STILL a movie... mostly... you know, right?!"" I think Deepwater Horizon is a good movie. It's honest in its presentation and the depictions of these men on the rig before the explosion, with just enough humanity to them (not to be confused with depth) that you can get invested when it kicks into 1000x gear, and near the very end there's some hard gut-punches that are more about how this *is* a trauma for those who lived through it and it may never go away completely. Could it have been a masterpiece? Not sure... maybe if James Cameron had been there.",Deepwater Horizon,1860357
59,chriskylie,Watchable but unexceptional disaster movie,7/10,16 August 2020,"A paint by numbers disaster film, saved by an A list cast and captivating effects.

61,jaysanchu07,I Hate BP,7/10,25 December 2022,"Deepwater Horizon is another worthy Peter Berg film that puts on screen a detailed telling of the 2010 oil spill disaster, considered as the largest in the
history of marine oil drilling. The film's success is testament to its technical marvel that elevates the intensity & gruesomeness. From the mind-blowing visuals and well crafted sound design, the mayhem & the ensuing panic are staged to perfection. Berg's consistent theme of offering a realistic vantage point through well executed action, is then achieved.Apart from the technical piece, it is a blessing to see Kurt Russel & John Malkovich mano a mano. Their on screen bickering, disputes & stare downs are completely engrossing, as each displayed immaculate acting prowess. Through superb portrayals, the heroes and villains they play, are effortlessly & fittingly acclaimed and abhorred. Mark Wahlberg on the other hand, was his usual self. He was excellent in normalcy but the worst in theatrics, that it was a convenient choice to obscure his facial expressions during demanding scenes.As for it's screenplay, Berg's formulaic first act resounds once more. The set-up of likable characters through playful conversations pays dividends, as audiences find attachment to these characters, furthering the impact when hell breaks loose. However, the spill over of these casual back and forths to succeeding acts are head scratching, as the grounded appeal does dissipate in favor of awkward & out of place one liners.Overall, Deepwater Horizon is a laudable thriller that delivers two things: a successful adaptation riddled with heart pounding action that never seems to let up, & fervor towards it's characters & the stories they tell.

63,dwpollar,Well done recreation of the BP oil rig that blew up in 2010...,8/10,10 May 2020,"1st watched 10/15/2016 :
Well done recreation of the BP oil rig that blew up in 2010 and started a major investigation. The movie is ""not"" about the investigation, but about the oil rig(called ""Deepwater Horizon""), and the people who worked on it and were a part of the disaster. This movie shines because it focuses on this aspect of the incident(the disaster itself). It stars a bunch of capable actors including Mark Wahlberg, Kurt Russell, John Malkovich, and Kate Hudson - who encompass a story, I believe, that people want to hear. The workers knew they weren't in for a cakewalk when they boarded the hovering ship. Right away - the 2 big dogs(Russell & Wahlberg) question the lack of a concrete stress test. The bigwigs are interested in getting the drilling done as quickly as possible, but the ones that know what they are doing won't easily falter. Eventually - after a few stress tests - they allow the drilling to happen, but things soon fall apart. The rest of the movie is the action of the disaster - unknown by most folks, without seeing this movie. This is why the movie is so interesting and effective. Not to be missed.

65,oscaralbert,This flick makes the case for a permanent total ban . . .,8/10,4 October 2016,". . . on ANY oil or gas extraction operations in America's coastal waters. The callous incompetent buffoons pictured here in DEEPWATER HORIZON murdered at least 650 dolphin people (which would constitute 3% or 80 million human deaths when extrapolated to Planet Earth's bloated human population). Since DEEPWATER, dolphin miscarriages are up 1,000%! Any poor baby dolphins which survive being born need to painfully struggle for each breath of their shortened lives, thanks to DEEPWATER. Because DEEPWATER decimated 8,332 species altogether, it will take experts hundreds of books to document all this carnage. (This movie glosses over this Holocaust among the Creatures God gave Man stewardship of by depicting a single dead pelican!) DEEPWATER HORIZON admits that the title ship had 390 broken systems the night of the disaster, April 20, 2010 (just after the 98th anniversary of the Titanic sinking)! Yet instead of chewing their fingernails, the crew was too busy partying and handing themselves safety awards! When ship personnel should have been heeding multiple warning alarms sounding among the few systems left working, they dismissed these as ""false positives"" to help their kids with homework, discuss car repairs, or conduct long-distance ""pillow talk,"" DEEPWATER HORIZON testifies. Though Gulf sharks--considered the cockroaches of the seas--were able to enjoy about a dozen crispy critters, the overall effects of the DEEPWATER HORIZON Apocalypse call for an $100,000 environmental surcharge on the type of monster Toyota pick-up truck driven by Mark Wahlberg's family, for no apparent reason when a Chevy Cruz would meet all their needs. Better yet, follow the federal government cash-for-clunkers program of a few years ago, and give drivers $5,000 vouchers good toward the purchase of a Chevy Malibu during the mandatory cementing of their gas-guzzling SUV, Minivan, Crossover, and Pick-up engines. While we're at it, DEEPWATER HORIZON suggests that Semitruck and Private Jetliner traffic must be given a compulsory time-out until all such engines are replaced with solar, battery, or steam power.

The lead by Mark Wahlberg is so off-base from the person he is based on, not to mention Kate Hudson does represent who she is supposed to, I mean it is just all off in every way. The acting could have been better, but with such a terribly generic script, who could tell.Next the story is overly simplistic. I was hoping that the movie would have more substance than it did. There is no thematic depth and they took a complex story that lasted months and had incredible political and commercial repercussions and boiled it down to a good-guy-bad-guy movie.Wayyyy too many special effects. Compared to the actual footage, it looks completely unreal. I also despise when movies have explosions going off constantly to make boring scenes exciting.There is more depth in a Bond movie, better effects in Jaws, and just about any movie is better than this.

On board the Deepwater Horizon, Mike and Mr. Jimmy (Kurt Russell) bode ill tidings when they discover that the departing drill team left without doing a safety check on the hole. Things turn from bad to worse as BP's Donald Vidrine (John Malkovich), aggrieved at being behind schedule and over budget, eschews the necessary concrete test and excuses a failed systems test in order to proceed with further drilling. Pretty soon, he looks like a jackass when the whole rig explodes in his face.And after that the film is just Wahlberg running around in a frenzy trying to get people off the rig and because of that they forgot to attached the characters to the viewers that the viewers didn't care anymore to watch the actual video of Deepwater Horizon after the film. 3 over 5. Competently made, more explosion and intense but not a pretty picture.",Deepwater Horizon,1860357
73,Joshumms,Great presentation of tragic events,7/10,22 November 2021,"A pretty good presentation of this tragic event. The beginning does a great job of showing all the neglect that caused the disaster. The last 40 minutes are intense and it's never overly dramatized to the point where the disaster is just an action movie. The movie is never too serious and the characters interactions are fun. Overall a satisfying presentation of these tragic events.

74,pilot1009,the true disaster here was the director,3/10,6 April 2017,"This is a confusing and extremely poorly directed film.The acting was good, the players did their job but sound direction made subtitles a requirement. A short course in oil drill operation would be a desirable pre requisite. The basic ideas were put as subtitles for the rest of us in the bottom left of the screen as a substitute for actually telling a story.The actual disaster is just a wild confusion of bangs and booms which are of themselves not particularly entertaining or enlightening. The bad guys wear white hats (which at least is novel) and even their part in the story is obscure.In short another example of bang crash boom with special effects instead of a real movie with plot or story to tell.",Deepwater Horizon,1860357
75,kosmasp,Disaster - for real,8/10,15 April 2017,"Only hearing about this, is one thing. But seeing it unfold is a completely different thing. And it's amazing that they would not be afraid to lay out the blame. On the other hand it does seem a bit cliché to call out a big company like that. And you really do need a great actor to represent that company so it doesn't fall short on many aspects (and the movie did a good job at casting one).It starts off pretty easy and slow, but early on you can tell that something is about to happen. Foreshadowing like at the breakfast table is almost not necessary, but it does add an extra touch. When the mayhem begins though, there is no stopping and the effects are up for it. It's breathtaking and heartbreaking at the same time.

76,TheMovieDiorama,The worst oil spill in US history makes for a technical spectacle.,8/10,3 October 2016,"The biographical disaster film about the titular oil rig, Deepwater Horizon is about the blowout and explosion of the oil rig and how it became the largest oil spill in US history. The trailers showed this to be an epic disaster film, but it is so much more than that...in fact this actually touched my heart. For the majority of the film it is a technical spectacle of explosions, fire, mud and more explosions, but then the last 10 minutes happen and it hits you right in the heart. There is not much to spoil, everyone knows what happened...but I shall not mention any specifics. This was a great chance for Mark Wahlberg to show off some acting and he did so reasonably well, but it was actually Kurt Russell who really showed his on-screen presence. The rest of the cast were also great, no one bad here. What everyone comes to watch in a disaster film are the effects, the visuals...and this film delivers by the bucket load. Plenty of fiery explosions and plenty of danger to keep viewers enthralled by the experience and just to try and empathise with the real people that went through this. That's where the film shines, when it reminds the viewers that these people were real and these events actually happened. The last 10 minutes showcases this beautifully with a touching tribute to those who lost their lives. The first half of the film builds up the suspense of the inevitable and actually informs us on what working on an oil rig is like, it was rather informative and I enjoyed it. From time to time the script does struggle in connecting Kate Hudson to the story and the family life of Wahlberg's character, it was as if they were trying to force it and sometimes it did not work. What did not work at all though were many of the camera shots, it seemed extremely zoomed in as if it was trying to enhance the frantic mayhem but if anything it just infuriated me that I couldn't see what was going on. Thankfully this did not happen all the time, but director Peter Berg (who directed Lone Survivor) knows better. Overall, Deepwater Horizon is a technical spectacle of a biographical disaster film with an emotional payoff that I did not see coming.Review at: http://www.themoviediorama.com",Deepwater Horizon,1860357
77,LawLess39,It was entertaining anywa,2/10,11 January 2017,"So I gave it an extra star. Other than the 'big boom' ... all I took away was ... the 'hint' at ... a poorly maintained rig ... by a undisciplined, poorly trained crew that seemed to be more interested in being comics than doing their jobs. For example ... when those valve bonnets started to give out ... they should have evacuated. There was a conspicuous absence of alarms going off? Of course I've had experience with machinery ... hollyweed has not.Then there seems to be a distancing from BP by bringing up the ... 'it's BP's oil well ... but not their rig'. The phones don't work? The monitors go 'blue' and this thing was still in service? US ships (Oil Tankers for example) have the ABS and USCG regulating them. Do these rigs have anyone (standards) to answer too? There is a on-the-fly 'hand off' meet on the helio deck? That nobody can hear because of the noise? The bang-boom-whoosh CG was good and the 'Die Hard' like scramble to survive was entertaining enough.There is an entertainment value to this movie ... so, $6? OK. Still ... the the 'oil spill data' at the end was bogus. There was a complete absence of the 'dispersant' BP, tried to hide, used to dummy up the spill numbers and - in the process - poisoned the gulf of Mexico? Oil spills are measured on the surface. So ... braking the oil down and getting it to 'mix' with the water keeps this number ... and the penalties ... down.Whether is is BP or Transocean ... it was still a matter of protecting their collective 'bottom' lines. This did not have to happen.",Deepwater Horizon,1860357

79,tstudstrup,Environmental disaster not dealt with.,1/10,8 August 2018,"This boring movie only deals with the events happening up untill the explosion.A bunch of rednecks, whose southern accent I could only understand with subtitles on, works on an oilrig. *SPOILERS AHEAD*A boss, played by always slimey John Malkovic,h is responsible for the accident, al though Im not sure how. There is alot of technical mumbo jumbo that only makes sense for people working on oilrigs. Mark Whalberg plays Mark Whalberg and Kate Hudson plays his annoying wife whose only job is to worry if her husband survived. Kurt Russel plays another boss, but he is one of the goodguys for some reason. If you expect an actionmovie you will be dissapointed. Nothing happens for 51 minutes. Youre introduced to alot of rednecks that you wont get to know or care about despite the movie taking its time before the explosion. And when the action does happen, its hard to tell whats going on, because its dark and there is alot of shaky cam. Afterwards there are videoes from a hearing and investigation into the accident. The characters played by Whalberg and Russel looks nothing like the real characters. Which is lazy and dumb. The impact on the environment from the explosion isn only dealt with, showing a pelican covered in oil and dying. And a text saying it was the worst oil disaster in US history. And then we see pictures of the real 11 killed rednecks with some annoying countrysong playing in the background. This movie doesnt know wether it wants to be drama or an actionmovie.

80,imseeg,The after taste of this above average action movie is bitter because it is whitewashing the worst ever oil disaster by NOT EVER mentioning the impact on the environment.,5/10,25 January 2019,"Just looked upon as an action/drama movie it is reasonably good, because the stunts and special effects are pretty impressive and the sentiments (violins, crying houswives and children) about the loss of 11 people is done with much effective melodrama towards the end. Great photography and editing and quite good acting performances by Kurt Russel and John Malkovich. Mark Wahlberg, as ever, just looks plain dumb, but for his standards he acts good as well. So just judging it as an action/drama it will make pass the time enjoyably, without ever getting really bored.The biggest criticism I have is what this movie does NOT show. What is not being shown? What is not even mentioned one single time? The devastating permanent impact on the environment. None of that is ever mentioned. That is ridiculous and whitewashing the actual events as they have happened. As if this was only a human drama and not also the worst environmental oil disaster in recorded history. I have got a bitter after taste because of that whitewashing of this historical environmental disaster.",Deepwater Horizon,1860357
81,jay-techie2007,A Decent Watch for the Sake of the Subject and Acting,7/10,20 October 2016,"Based on one of the worst environmental disasters, Deepwater Horizon does well enough - largely due to its casting and well-directed climax. From what I have read, the movie made some technical mistakes, but that may be noticeable to people who have read about the disaster in detail.Story (7/10): Deepwater horizon brings back the memories of the 2010 Gulf of Mexico disaster that was perhaps one of the worst environmental disasters till date. The story revolves around the Chief Electrical Engineer, played by Mark Wahlberg, and general operational supervisor, played by Kurt Russell, and their futile efforts to convince the money minded BP officials about the potentially fatal dangers of trimmed down inspections and distorted tests. Unfortunately, the inevitable happens and the story moves around how the Chief Electrical Engineer goes beyond the call of duty to save every single life possible. In real life incident based movies - research can make or break the movie. The movie falls a little short in terms of the accuracy and details of the events and the cause of the explosion. Acting (8/10): Kurt Russell and Mark Wahlberg did great work in lead roles. Mark Wahlberg has this subtle honesty that gets projected in almost every movie and has helped him a lot here with the kind of character he played. Kurt Russell, complementing Mark, projects a strong leader who survives some of the most brutal blows as the rig sets ablaze. John Malkovich, playing the negative role, is impressive with his dialog delivery. However, what was more noticeable was the screen presence of the supporting cast around these two. I felt this was a movie where everyone gave their best, or at least tried to. In such movies, the lead actors tend to take over the entire movie but that didn't happen here. Direction (7/10): Peter Berg does a decent job with a slow and vague build up to the plot. However, once the disaster hits, the direction of sequences and the special effects is very impressive. In patches, the director stretches it too far in terms of showing the protagonists survive intensely fatal blows - but I guess that's why they make movies. The use of supporting cast and allowing them to show their presence makes the movie a little unique. Overall (7/10): In spite of some technical mistakes and below par first half, this movie is a decent watch for the sake of the subject and acting.",Deepwater Horizon,1860357

83,Floated2,Based on True events could have been more,6/10,21 June 2017,"Deepwater Horizon is apparently based on the true real life events of The Deepwater Horizon oil spill which occurred in 2010. This was both a financial disaster for BP, and an ongoing environmental catastrophe. Reportedly an estimated 4.9 million barrels of oil spilled out into the Gulf of Mexico over the 87 days that it took to plug the hole, leaving the sea a blackened wasteland of dead and diseased.Based upon real people Mike Williams (Mark Wahlberg) routinely boards the rig, leaves his wife (Kate Hudson) and daughter on shore. On board the Deepwater Horizon, Mike and Mr. Jimmy (Kurt Russell) bode ill tidings when they discover that the departing drill team left without doing a safety check on the hole. This film is entertaining at certain moments but as a whole, one must be invested in the type of film this is, which is a real based true events disaster film. With a large budget of over $110 million and only making over $120 million worldwide, this film did not make as much as the studios hoped for, or was not praised as much either, as they intended some Oscar nominations. Overall Deepwater Horizon has its moments but as a whole is quite boring, which is shameful because the film is quite well made and we can notice much research was done. The main problem is that they waited a few years too long to make and release this film, which is a reason for its flopping at the box office. As a rewatch 06/17/20 opinions remain same. The film starts off relatively slow as it builds then gets quite engaging. Overall the story as tragic of a disaster as it has been doesn't quite provide such an interesting tale.",Deepwater Horizon,1860357
84,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Deepwater Horizon,5/10,1 October 2016,"I admire Peter Berg's passion for being the dude that honors real-life heroes. It labored in his box office hit Lone Survivor but with Deepwater Horizon (my latest review), it just feels like hackwork.Berg is the art film director's version of Michael Bay. He's the guy who made Very Bad Things and ""Horizon"" is a ""very"" humdrum movie. This $156 million dollar release is based on true events and depicts the biggest oil spill in U.S. history (circa 2010). There's lots of nasty fire, flying nuts and bolts, broken bones, plenty of crew member speak, and mud covering the trouper's faces. Oh yeah, it's hot as heck on that oil rig. Pay attention though because as a viewer, it's hard to tell what's going on via ""Horizon's"" stilted camera-work and darkened cinematography.Now for kicks and giggles, I read somewhere that a critic referred to this vehicle as ""a poor man's Towering Inferno"". Makes sense. ""Inferno"" has more compelling characters, doesn't come with a disjointed and clunky script, has more suspense, doesn't have its actors mumble their lines as if they have cotton in their mouths, and has a climax for the ages (""Horizon"" not so much). Plus, The Towering Inferno (1974) is longer in length with stupendous editing. Talk about a cinematic oxymoron.In regards to Deepwater Horizon, well Peter Berg shortens his film to 107 minutes. By explaining everything that happened to certain drillers in the closing credits, it feels as though he's trying to get this thing over with to get to his December release (see sixth paragraph).So OK, ""Horizon"" is a BP subjection, a moviegoer's guide to drilling rig mumbo jumbo. It's also a rushed tribute that thinly honors the eleven people that died in one of the world's biggest man-made disasters. Disappointing is the word I thought of as I left the theater.Anyway, Deepwater Horizon has odd Louisiana accents from big name actors (Mark Wahlberg, Kurt Russell, John Malkovich), horrific images that have become Peter Berg's staple since Lone Survivor (mentioned earlier), and special effects that are technically efficient yet chaotic and messy. It's disaster porn but not in an eye candy sort of way. You sense that Berg wants to project things to be more realistic, more mechanical in nature. He's a filmmaker mired in being up to date and he makes his proceedings feel military even if it's about grubby, dirty oil riggers. Here's the problem though: He can't seem to wring any emotional response from me (I know I'm not alone on this). Let's hope that his next real- life salute being Patriots Day, fills that void. Rating: 2 stars.",Deepwater Horizon,1860357
85,dillonjeffers-52163,A Real Monster Story!,8/10,15 February 2021,"I didn't really know what to expect when first going into this film. For the most part it was shot great. Being base on a true story. I believe they captured some great moments. There's several scenes in this movie the I love to re-watch. There's a part where Mark Wahlberg's character is telling his daughter about his job and its just awesome to watch. My favorite character in the film is the Oil Drill. Its a true beast. Some shots reminded me of Steven Spielberg's movie Jaws. Acting in this film was good from all the actors and the special effects are good. There's just a few events/hero moments that where just a little over the top to me. But... This is a survival story and its a great watch.

Safety concerns, managements push for profits over safety and the suspicion that something was wrong! Great acting from the lead roles. Kurt Russell is the ever vigilant, all knowing alpha male safety consultant. Kurt Russell's character was a hard edge in a serious Charlton Heston way. Mark Whalberg is the family oriented caring professional loved by his crew. John Malkovich is the the push for it's costing us profits manager and is manipulative. The management team does not answer why the safety team's check was cancelled. Deepwater Horizon background of the rig, processes, and extras gave the realism of the oil platform. Berg directs the foreground and background of oil rig procedures and characters into a realistic disaster story so well, that Deep Water Horizion is hard to Watch! Eight out of ten. There is even an explanation that the well is so deep that the pressure of the earth and oil was too great for the dig.",Deepwater Horizon,1860357
87,stevendbeard,Better Than I Was Expecting,7/10,30 September 2016,"I saw ""Deepwater Horizon"", starring Mark Wahlberg-Daddy's Home, Boogie Nights; Kurt Russell-The Hateful Eight, Tango & Cash; Kate Hudson- Mother's Day, Glee_tv and John Malkovich-The Red movies, Jonah Hex.This movie is based on a true story about the offshore oil drilling rig- Deepwater Horizon-that was responsible for the biggest oil spill in U.S. history. It happened in April of 2010. It's directed by Peter Berg, a former actor himself who has directed Lone Survivor, Hancock & Friday Night Lights, just to name a few, and he directs this movie just like it was an action packed disaster movie. This also marks the first time that Kate has worked on screen with her step-father, Kurt. I was a little familiar with the incident but this goes into more of the details that led up to the disaster. Mark & Kurt work on the oil rig that is about 50 miles off shore. Kate plays Mark's wife and John is the corporate BP executive that is more interested in profits than anything else. Kurt is the boss of the rig and when John pushes for results-they are 43 days behind schedule-corners are cut and safety precautions are ignored. Besides the approximate 5 million barrels of oil that leaked during the ecological disaster, 11 people died and they are acknowledged as the end credits start with their names and photos. FYI: If you are a country music fan, keep an eye out for Trace Adkins-some know him as Tracy Adkins but in the credits, he uses Trace. He has a small cameo near the end of the movie-he picks Mark up and shakes him pretty violently. It's rated ""PG-13"" for intense disaster sequences, disturbing images and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 47 minutes. Although I don't think I would buy it on DVD, it was better than I was expecting it to be and it would be a great rental.",Deepwater Horizon,1860357
88,kayfret,Does what it says on the tin...,6/10,19 October 2016,"An action-thriller disaster movie based on true events - basically you go in already knowing what to expect and that's pretty much what you get. I certainly wasn't bored, but I also wasn't overly thrilled. The tension does build up to good effect, though unfortunately there were no standout moments or performances. (I've never been a Mark Wahlberg fan, though he is perfectly tolerable here, Kurt Russell is decent, as is John Malkovich, though I found his Cajun accent jarring). Loss of human life is, of course, tragic and it's understandable that this was the focus, but I'm disappointed that they barely even mentioned the horrific ecological disaster that followed.

The film centers around Mike Williams (Mark Wahlberg) the Chief Electronics Technician (according to his hard hat but he was an engineer) of the crew and to a lesser extended through Andrea Fleytas (Gina Rodriguez) an operator. The operation of the drilling is explained early in the film by Mike's daughter using a coke can and honey for a school project. Ominously the coke sprays out the top.We see Mike struggle to maintain a safe ship against the pressure of schedule and profits as they drill ""the well from hell."" He says, ""Every time I peel off a band-aid I find three or four more. "" He butts head with John Malkovich who had the honor of playing BP engineer and representative Don Vidrine, the film's bad guy. He helps explains things to Don by comparing safety to noodling.The special effects were pretty intense. Like so many major accidents, people want to deny they are happening until too late. The irony is that this unsafe rig was getting a safety award for being BP's safest rig.

91,MOscarbradley,Outstanding,8/10,22 July 2018,"A disaster movie about a disaster that really happened. In his film ""Deepwater Horizon"", director Peter Berg adopts a documentary approach and takes his time getting to the big bang and the movie is all the better for it. This is a movie that never exploits either its subject or its characters while still ticking all the necessary boxes and benefits considerably from a first-rate cast, (Mark Wahlberg, Kurt Russell, a terrific John Malkovitch, Kate Hudson etc), all at the top of their game; no mean feat when the real star of the picture is an exploding oil rig, (special effects, cinematography, editing, sound recording are all top notch). As disaster movies go, this is highly effective and in the end, very moving.

I do of course remember the story when it took place in a real life, and Peter Berg i think did they outstanding job into showing us what has happened (partly at least) during that horrific night. Acting was pretty solid, directing ""is Peter Berg all the way"" - which i love it and special effects were really good / great - you kinda can feel the heat (no wonder it got 2 Oscar nominations in tech. categories).Overall, ""Deepwater Horizon"" is a very good action film (yes) based on a very true events.

93,pendenquejohn,Good but slightly blown out of proportions on certain scenes,5/10,5 January 2017,"From a general perspective I would say that this was quite a good movie trying to relate facts that were unfortunate, not in fiction, but this time in the real. It shows a reality in which unfortunately a small group of fortunate rich guys are willing to talk only profit or revenue for themselves at risk of people losing lives. For whatever reason, I would guess that this is a common case in the petroleum industry.From a overall perspective I found the acting to be good and story to be captivating. Quite frankly, there are many times where I ranted, felt pity, sadness or concern -; and I would guess that these are the types of emotions that make you realize that the movie was particularly interesting.The action scenes were overall quite dynamic though some were a little bit pushed to the limit.The end is probably the most gripping from an emotional standpoint. It definitively makes you realize the amount of suffering and pressure in which ""black gold"" puts some individuals for the sole purpose of consumers who then spend a large spectrum of their lives enjoying the destruction of our planet through pollution. This movie really makes us realize that we do not deserve that and should almost certainly take another kind of direction.",Deepwater Horizon,1860357

We all know the events of the BP disaster, a ecological one ..... the only one mention of the effect of leaking over 100 million tons of oil into the ocean was early in the film when one lone pelican covered in oil was "" thrown "" no doubt by the film crew on to the deck... The rest of the film is explosion after explosion akin to a nuclear bomb going off, the result of which was the deaths of ONLY 11 rig staff, from what you saw you you have expected not one survivor...... As you gathered a terrible film,disgusting in the fact that no mention was made of the devastating effects on our sea, coastline,marine and bird life was ever mentioned..... Unforgivable.",Deepwater Horizon,1860357
